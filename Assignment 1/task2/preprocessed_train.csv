"One of the other reviewer ha mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you 'll be hooked . They are right , a this is exactly what happened with me . The first thing that struck me about Oz wa it brutality and unflinching scene of violence , which set in right from the word GO . Trust me , this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid . This show pull no punch with regard to drug , sex or violence . Its is hardcore , in the classic use of the word . It is called OZ a that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary . It focus mainly on Emerald City , an experimental section of the prison where all the cell have glass front and face inwards , so privacy is not high on the agenda . Em City is home to many .. Aryans , Muslims , gangsta , Latinos , Christians , Italians , Irish and more .... so scuffle , death stare , dodgy dealing and shady agreement are never far away . I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it go where other show would n't dare . Forget pretty picture painted for mainstream audience , forget charm , forget romance ... OZ doe n't mess around . The first episode I ever saw struck me a so nasty it wa surreal , I could n't say I wa ready for it , but a I watched more , I developed a taste for Oz , and got accustomed to the high level of graphic violence . Not just violence , but injustice ( crooked guard who 'll be sold out for a nickel , inmate who 'll kill on order and get away with it , well mannered , middle class inmate being turned into prison bitch due to their lack of street skill or prison experience ) Watching Oz , you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing .... thats if you can get in touch with your darker side .",1
"A wonderful little production . The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and give a comforting , and sometimes discomforting , sense of realism to the entire piece . The actor are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only `` ha got all the polari '' but he ha all the voice down pat too ! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the reference to Williams ' diary entry , not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece . A masterful production about one of the great master 's of comedy and his life . The realism really come home with the little thing : the fantasy of the guard which , rather than use the traditional 'dream ' technique remains solid then disappears . It play on our knowledge and our sens , particularly with the scene concerning Orton and Halliwell and the set ( particularly of their flat with Halliwell 's mural decorating every surface ) are terribly well done .",1
"I thought this wa a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend , sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy . The plot is simplistic , but the dialogue is witty and the character are likable ( even the well bread suspected serial killer ) . While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2 : Risk Addiction , I thought it wa proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of u have grown to love . This wa the most I 'd laughed at one of Woody 's comedy in year ( dare I say a decade ? ) . While I 've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson , in this she managed to tone down her `` sexy '' image and jumped right into a average , but spirited young woman . This may not be the crown jewel of his career , but it wa wittier than `` Devil Wears Prada '' and more interesting than `` Superman '' a great comedy to go see with friend .",1
"Basically there 's a family where a little boy ( Jake ) think there 's a zombie in his closet & his parent are fighting all the time . This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly , Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie . OK , first of all when you 're going to make a film you must Decide if it a thriller or a drama ! As a drama the movie is watchable . Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life . And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruin all the film ! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie , and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spot . 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parent & descent dialog . As for the shot with Jake : just ignore them .",0
"Petter Mattei 's `` Love in the Time of Money '' is a visually stunning film to watch . Mr. Mattei offer u a vivid portrait about human relation . This is a movie that seems to be telling u what money , power and success do to people in the different situation we encounter . This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler 's play about the same theme , the director transfer the action to the present time New York where all these different character meet and connect . Each one is connected in one way , or another to the next person , but no one seems to know the previous point of contact . Stylishly , the film ha a sophisticated luxurious look . We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat . The only thing one get out of all these soul in the picture is the different stage of loneliness each one inhabits . A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relation find sincere fulfillment , a one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter . The acting is good under Mr. Mattei 's direction . Steve Buscemi , Rosario Dawson , Carol Kane , Michael Imperioli , Adrian Grenier , and the rest of the talented cast , make these character come alive . We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work .",1
"Probably my all-time favorite movie , a story of selflessness , sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause , but it 's not preachy or boring . It just never get old , despite my having seen it some 15 or more time in the last 25 year . Paul Lukas ' performance brings tear to my eye , and Bette Davis , in one of her very few truly sympathetic role , is a delight . The kid are , a grandma say , more like `` dressed-up midget '' than child , but that only make them more fun to watch . And the mother 's slow awakening to what 's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . If I had a dozen thumb , they 'd all be `` up '' for this movie .",1
"I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero 's every week.You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure.Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoint about TV and the many movies.So any ole way I believe I 've got what I wan na say.Would be nice to read some more plus point about sea hunt.If my rhyme would be 10 line would you let me submit , or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit , If this is so then I must go so let do it .",1
"This show wa an amazing , fresh & innovative idea in the 70 's when it first aired . The first 7 or 8 year were brilliant , but thing dropped off after that . By 1990 , the show wa not really funny anymore , and it 's continued it decline further to the complete waste of time it is today . It 's truly disgraceful how far this show ha fallen . The writing is painfully bad , the performance are almost a bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts , this show probably would n't still be on the air . I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hack that followed . How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity ? I felt I must give 2 star out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success . As it is now , the show is just awful . I ca n't believe it 's still on the air .",0
"Encouraged by the positive comment about this film on here I wa looking forward to watching this film . Bad mistake . I 've seen 950+ film and this is truly one of the worst of them - it 's awful in almost every way : editing , pacing , storyline , 'acting , ' soundtrack ( the film 's only song - a lame country tune - is played no le than four time ) . The film look cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme . Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credit of a film . The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort . One for Keitel obsessive only .",0
"If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie . If you are young or old then you will love this movie , hell even my mom liked it . Great Camp ! ! !",1
"Phil the Alien is one of those quirky film where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines . At first it wa very odd and pretty funny but a the movie progressed I did n't find the joke or oddness funny anymore . Its a low budget film ( thats never a problem in itself ) , there were some pretty interesting character , but eventually I just lost interest . I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking . For something similar but better try `` Brother from another planet ''",0
"I saw this movie when I wa about 12 when it came out . I recall the scariest scene wa the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachute right out of the air . The horror . The horror . As a young kid going to these cheesy B film on Saturday afternoon , I still wa tired of the formula for these monster type movie that usually included the hero , a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end . I did n't care much for the romantic angle a a 12 year old and the predictable plot . I love them now for the unintentional humor . But , about a year or so later , I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star , Janet Leigh , wa bumped off early in the film . I sat up and took notice at that point . Since screenwriter are making up the story , make it up to be a scary a possible and not from a well-worn formula . There are no rule .",0
"So im not a big fan of Boll 's work but then again not many are . I enjoyed his movie Postal ( maybe im the only one ) . Boll apparently bought the right to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself wa even finsished . People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research lab located on a tropical island should be warned , that this is not Far Cry ... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmuck .. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invite three of his countryman to play with . These player go by the name of Til Schweiger , Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller . Three name that actually have made them self pretty big in the movie biz . So the tale go like this , Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger ( yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dude ! ! ) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass .. People have complained about how he 's not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we do n't really know what he looked like when he wa kicking a * * .. However , the storyline in this film is beyond demented . We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier , making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS a they are called . Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of `` SPOILER '' Vancouver for some reason . Thats right no palm tree here . Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods . We have n't even gone FAR before I started to CRY ( mehehe ) I can not go on any more .. If you wan na stay true to Bolls shenanigan then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience , meaning most of it will suck . There are some thing worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some area of the film such a some nice boat and fighting scene . Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just make me laugh .. The movie Far Cry reek of scheisse ( that 's poop for you simpleton ) from a fa , r if you wan na take a wiff go ahead .. BTW Carver get a very annoying sidekick who make you wan na shoot him the first three minute he 's on screen .",0
"The cast played Shakespeare . Shakespeare lost . I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the mass , but why ruin something so good . Is it because 'The Scottish Play ' is my favorite Shakespeare ? I do not know . What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler ( hence bowdlerization ) tried to do something similar in the Victorian era . In other word , you can not improve perfection . I have no more to write but a I have to write at least ten line of text ( and English composition wa never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie , a the saying go , just doe not cut it .",0
This a fantastic movie of three prisoner who become famous . One of the actor is george clooney and I 'm not a fan but this roll is not bad . Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack ( The man of constant sorrow ) . I recommand this movie to everybody . Greetings Bart,1
"Kind of drawn in by the erotic scene , only to realize this wa one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bit of film I 've ever seen . Sort of like a high school film project . What wa Rosanna Arquette thinking ? ? And what wa with all those stock character in that bizarre supposed Midwest town ? Pretty hard to get involved with this one . No lesson to be learned from it , no brilliant insight , just stilted and quite ridiculous ( but lot of skin , if that intrigue you ) videotaped nonsense .... What wa with the bisexual relationship , out of nowhere , after all the heterosexual encounter . And what wa with that absurd dance , with everybody playing their stereotyped role ? Give this one a pas , it 's like a million other mile of bad , wasted film , money that could have been spent on starving child or Aids in Africa .....",0
"Some film just simply should not be remade . This is one of them . In and of itself it is not a bad film . But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title . Liam Neeson wa excellent a he always is , and most of the cast hold up , with the exception of Owen Wilson , who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke . But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it 's attempt to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effect . Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .",1
"This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movie . Horrible . There wa n't a continuous minute where there wa n't a fight with one monster or another . There wa no chance for any character development , they were too busy running from one sword fight to another . I had no emotional attachment ( except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them ) Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movie , LOTR , Star Wars and Matrix . Examples > The ghost scene at the end wa stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda , Obee One and Vader . > The spider machine in the beginning wa exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings . ( Elijah Wood is the victim in both film ) and wait ...... it hypnotizes ( sting ) it victim and wrap them up ..... uh hello ? ? ? ? > And the whole machine vs. human theme WAS the Matrix .. or Terminator ..... There are more example but why waste the time ? And will someone tell me what wa with the Nazi 's ? ! ? ! Nazi 's ? ? ? ? There wa a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion . The movie could not decide if it wa a child 's movie or an adult movie and wa n't much of either . Just awful . A real disappointment to say the least . Save your money .",0
"I remember this film , it wa the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture wa dark in place i wa very nervous it wa back in 74/75 my Dad took me my brother & sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England . I recall the tiger and the lot of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tiger get shot and dy . If anyone know where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.The cinema now ha been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame a the nearest cinema now is 20 mile away , would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it .",1
"An awful film ! It must have been up against some real stinker to be nominated for the Golden Globe . They 've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition . My complaint is not that they 've taken liberty with the fact ; if the story were good , that would perfectly fine . But it 's simply bizarre -- by all account the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film , so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script ? I suppose there were n't enough naked people in the factual version . It 's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist 's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hour if they 'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity .",0
"After the success of Die Hard and it 's sequel it 's no surprise really that in the 1990s , a glut of 'Die Hard on a ..... ' movie cashed in on the wrong guy , wrong place , wrong time concept . That is what they did with Cliffhanger , Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot ' Stallone 's career . Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream , especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing , base-jumping , aviation , facial expression , acting skill . All in all it 's full of excuse to dismiss the film a one overblown pile of junk . Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse ! However , if you an forget all the nonsense , it 's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers a plenty of thrill , and unintentionally , plenty of laugh . You 've got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness , his tick every box band of baddie , and best of all , the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat ' agent , Rex Linn a Travers . He may of been Henry in 'Portrait of a Serial Killer ' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance a Hal , he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captor 'that man never hurt anybody ' And whilst he surely ca n't be , it really doe look like Ralph Waite 's Frank character is grinning a the girl plummet to her death . Mention too must go to former 'London 's Burning ' actor Craig Fairbrass a the Brit bad guy , who come a cropper whilst using Hal a a Human Football , yes , you ca n't help enjoy that bit , Hal needed a good kicking . So forget your better judgement , who care if 'that could never happen ' , lower your acting expectation , turn up the volume and enjoy ! And if you 're looking for Qaulen , he 's the one wearing the helicopter .",1
"I had the terrible misfortune of having to view this `` b-movie '' in it 's entirety . All I have to say is -- - save your time and money ! ! ! This ha got to be the worst b-movie of all time , it should n't even be called a b-movie , more like an f-movie ! Because it fails in all aspect that make a good movie : the story is not interesting at all , all of the actor are paper-thin and not at all believable , it ha bad direction and the action sequence are so fake it 's almost funny ....... almost . The movie is just packed full of crappy one-liner that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit . This movie is supposed to be geared towards men , but all the woman in it are SO utterly unattractive , especially that old wrinkled thing that come in towards the end . They try to appear sexy in those weird , horrible costume and they fail miserably ! ! ! Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laugh , but this is just too painful to watch ! !",0
"What an absolutely stunning movie , if you have 2.5 hr to kill , watch it , you wo n't regret it , it 's too much fun ! Rajnikanth carry the movie on his shoulder and although there is n't anything more other than him , I still liked it . The music by A.R.Rehman take time to grow on you but after you heard it a few time , you really start liking it .",1
"First of all , let 's get a few thing straight here : a ) I AM an anime fan- always ha been a a matter of fact ( I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool ) . b ) I DO like several B-Movies because they 're hilarious . c ) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot . Moving on , when the movie first come on , it seems like it 's going to be your usual B-movie , down to the crappy FX , but all a sudden- BOOM ! the anime come on ! This is when the movie go WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill . The animation is VERY bad & cheap , even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER , for crissakes ! In fact , it 's so cheap , one of the few scene from the movie I `` vividly '' remember is when a bunch of kid run out of a school ... & it 's the same kid over & over again ! The FX are terrible , too ; the dinosaur look worse than Godzilla . In addition , the transition to live action to animation is unorganized , the dialogue & voice ( especially the English dub that I viewed ) wa horrid & I wa begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player ; The only thing that kept me surviving wa cracking out joke & comment like the robot & Joel/Mike on MST3K ( you pick the season ) . Honestly , this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time . Heck , I 'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night . Because it 's stupid , pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time , I 'm giving this movie a 3/10 , an improvement from the 0.5/10 I wa originally going to give it . ( According to my grading scale : 3/10 mean Pretty much both boring & bad . As fun a counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it , then it will become a fun a counting to 15 . )",0
This wa the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards ! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actor in the film . It 's great to see J.Beals but she 's only in the movie for a few minute . M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for . The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable . The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch . There is no real emotional depth to the story . A movie revolving about an actor who ca n't get work doe n't feel very original to me . Nor doe the development of the cop . It feel like one of many straight-to-video movie I saw back in the 90 ... And not even a good one in those standard .,0
"The Karen Carpenter Story show a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in giving accurate fact , and detail . Cynthia Gibb ( portrays Karen ) wa not a fine election . She is a good actress , but play a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter . I think that the role needed a stronger character . Someone with a stronger personality . Louise Fletcher role a Agnes Carpenter is terrific , she doe a great job a Karen 's mother . It ha great song , which could have been included in a soundtrack album . Unfortunately they were n't , though this movie wa on the top of the rating in USA and other several country",1
"`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer , but also into one of a very talented director . This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human being unleash their uninhibited imagination . This is boldness at work , pushing aside thought to fall into formula and cliche and creating something truly magnificent . This is the best movie of the year to date . I 've read numerous complaint about this film , anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast character and bad acting . To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point . This movie may be a landmark , a tradition where future movie will hopefully follow . `` The Cell '' ha just opened the door to another world of imagination . So can we slam the door in it face and tell it and it director Tarsem Singh that we do n't want any more ? Personally , I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem , and would love to see someone try to challenge him . We 've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer , and yes , I do agree that the `` genre '' is a bit overworked . The 90 were full of movie trying to depict what make serial killer tick ; some of them worked , but most failed . But `` The Cell '' doe not blaze down the same trail , we are given a new twist , we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing le than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied . I like how the movie doe not bog u down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually get to enter the brain of another . Instead , she just lie down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what look like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity . `` The Cell '' want to let you `` see '' what it 's all about and not `` how '' it 's all about , and I guess that 's what some people do n't like . True , I do like explanation with my movie , but when a movie venture onto new ground you must let it do what it desire and simply take it in . I noticed how the film wa very dark when it showed reality , maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another . Nonetheless , the set design wa simply astonishing . I would n't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography , best costume , best director and the like . If it were up to me it 'd at least get nominated for best picture . I 've noticed that I 've kind of been repeating myself . Not because there 's nothing else to say , but because I ca n't stress enough how fantastic I thought `` The Cell '' wa . If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonder and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time . I guess this film wa just a little too much for some people , writing it off a `` weird '' or `` crazy '' . I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind , so it wa right down my alley . Leaving the theater , I heard one audience member say `` Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drug . '' If so , I want what he wa smoking . * * * * ( out of 4 )",1
"This film tried to be too many thing all at once : stinging political satire , Hollywood blockbuster , sappy romantic comedy , family value promo ... the list go on and on . It failed miserably at all of them , but there wa enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end . Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR , INC. , it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort , especially when it will be taken by it target to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique , rather than simply the poor writing , direction , and production of this particular film . There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war . But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening . Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS , which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern .",0
"This movie wa so frustrating . Everything seemed energetic and I wa totally prepared to have a good time . I at least thought I 'd be able to stand it . But , I wa wrong . First , the weird looping ? It wa like watching `` America 's Funniest Home Videos '' . The damn parent . I hated them so much . The stereo-typical Latino family ? I need to speak with the person responsible for this . We need to have a talk . That little girl who wa always hanging on someone ? I just hated her and had to mention it . Now , the final scene transcends , I must say . It 's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of it own . What crappy dancing . Horrible and beautiful at once .",0
"'War movie ' is a Hollywood genre that ha been done and redone so many time that clichéd dialogue , rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequence seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat . Once in a while , however , a war movie come along that go against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen . The Civil War-era `` Cold Mountain , '' starring Jude Law , Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film . Then again , calling Cold Mountain '' a war movie is not entirely accurate . True enough , the film open with a ( quite literally ) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that put `` Glory '' director Edward Zwick shame . However , `` Cold Mountain '' is not so much about the Civil War itself a it is about the period and the people of the time . The story center around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman , played by Jude Law , who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain , North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind , Ada Monroe , played by Nicole Kidman . At first glance , this setup appears formulaic a the romantic interest back home give the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier 's tribulation on the battlefield . Indeed , the earlier segment of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived . `` Cold Mountain '' soon take a drastic turn , though , a the intrepid hero Inman turn out to be a deserter ( incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates ) and begin a long odyssey homeward . Meanwhile , back at the farm , Ada 's cultured way prove of little use in the field ; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast . Coming to Ada 's rescue is the course , tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes , played by Renée Zellweger , who help Ada put the farm back together and , perhaps more importantly , cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada . Within these two setting , a vivid , compelling and , at time , very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds . The character with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex , enhanced by wonderful performance of Brendan Gleeson a Ruby 's deadbeat father , Ray Winstone a an unrepentant southern `` lawman , '' and Natalie Portman a a deeply troubled and isolated young mother . All have been greatly affected and changed by `` the war of Northern aggression , '' mostly for the worse . The dark , pervading anti-war message , accented by an effective , haunting score and chillingly beautiful shot of Virginia and North Carolina , is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scene a by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war wa fought . Though the weapon and tactic of war itself have changed much in the past century , it 's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant . Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film , but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that doe little justice to the wonderfully formed character . The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film , though the inherently distant , abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fit the dismal nature of the rest of the plot . Make no mistake , `` Cold Mountain '' ha neither the trait of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama . It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the life of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of it terrible repercussion altogether .",1
"Taut and organically gripping , Edward Dmytryk 's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller , an unlikely `` message '' movie using the look and device of the noir cycle . Bivouacked in Washington , DC , a company of soldier cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bar . Three of them end up at a stranger 's apartment where Robert Ryan , drunk and belligerent , beat their host ( Sam Levene ) to death because he happens to be Jewish . Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum , who 's assigned to Ryan 's outfit . Suspicion fall on the second of the three ( George Cooper ) , who ha vanished . Ryan slays the third buddy ( Steve Brodie ) to insure his silence before Young close in . Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton , Dmytryk draw precise performance from his three starring Bobs . Ryan , naturally , doe his prototypical Angry White Male ( and to the hilt ) , while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance ( his role , however , is not central ) ; Young may never have been better . Gloria Grahame give her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed , vulnerable tramp , and , a a sad sack who 's leeched into her life , Paul Kelly haunt u in a small , peripheral role that he make memorable . The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing , but it 's pretty much confined to Young 's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hand of bigot a century earlier ( thus , incidentally , stretching chronology to the limit ) . At least there 's no attempt to render an explanation , however glib , of why Ryan hate Jews ( and hillbilly and ... ) . Curiously , Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it 's based on ( Richard Brooks ' The Brick Foxhole ) dealt with a gay-bashing murder . But homosexuality in 1947 wa still Beyond The Pale . News of the Holocaust had , however , begun to emerge from the ash of Europe , so Hollywood felt emboldened to register it protest against anti-Semitism ( the studio always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer ) . But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism work in general , the specific do n't fit so smoothly . The victim 's chatting up a lonesome , drunk young soldier then inviting him back home look odd , even though ( or especially since ) there 's a girlfriend in tow . It raise the question whether this scenario wa retained inadvertently or left in a a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan 's murderous rage .",1
"`` Ardh Satya '' is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema . Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani , this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success . Even today , Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading director of India . The film tell the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70 . Unlike any Police of other city in India , Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether . Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment . Amongst various Police officer & colleague , the film describes the story of Anand Velankar , a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family . His father is a harsh Police Constable . Anand himself suffers from his father 's ideology & incidence of his father 's Atrocities on his mother . Anand 's approach towards immediate action against crime , is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction . The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand 's constant effort against crime are trampled by his seniors.This lead to frustration , a he can not achieve the desired Job-satisfaction . Resulting from the frustration , his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand room & bar , also turning him to an alcoholic . The Spirit within him is still alive , a he constantly fight the system . He is aware of the system of the Metro , where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end . His compromise towards unethical practice is negative . Finally he get suspended . The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core . One of the best memorable scene is when Anand break in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty 's house to arrest him , followed by short conversation which is fantastic . At many scene , the film ha Hair-raising moment . The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch . Alcoholism , Corruption , Political Influence , Courage , Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today . Those aspect are dealt brilliantly . Finally , the film belongs to the One man show , Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotion absolutely brilliantly .",1
"My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one . I wa excited to find this title among the offering from Anchor Bay Video , which ha brought u other cult classic such a `` Spider Baby '' . The print quality is excellent , but this alone ca n't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull . There 's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villager exact a terrible revenge on the Templars ( & set the whole thing in motion ) , but everything else in the movie is slow , ponderous & , ultimately , unfulfilling . Adding insult to injury : the movie wa dubbed , not subtitled , a promised on the video jacket .",0
"One of the most significant quote from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist , the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo , a physically non-descript , middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy . When we 're introduced to him at the start of the film , he 's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten year , conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to . While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene take place employee of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo 's cash tell him that 10,000 dollar are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknote . At the news , he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account . Meanwhile he tell u , the spectator , that when you bluff , you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous . He say : you ca n't bluff for a while and then halfway through , tell the truth . Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth , and having accepted the consequence of life and ultimately , love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo 's trouble . This initially unsympathetic character , a scowling , taciturn , curt man on the verge of 50 , a man who wo n't even reply in kind to chambermaid and waitress who say hello and goodbye , becomes at one point someone the spectator care deeply about . At one point in his non-life , Titta decides to feel concern about appearing `` ridiculous '' . The first half of the film may be described a `` slow '' by some . It doe indeed reveal Di Girolamo 's day and night in that hotel at an oddly disjoined , deliberate pace , revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant detail . However , scene that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are a this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eye . The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination , identity or life , the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequence and very interesting use of music ( one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out ) . Never wa the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobster more at odds than since the release of film such a Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore . Another interesting element wa the way in which the film made use of the protagonist 's insomnia . Not unlike The Machinist ( and in a far more explicit way , the Al Pacino film Insomnia ) , Le Conseguenze dell'Amore us this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that 's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious , it 's almost impossible to pin-point it cause ( if indeed there is one ) . The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia ( played by Olivia Magnani , grand-daughter of the legendary Anna ) and the memory of Titta 's best friend , a man whom he ha n't seen in 20 year , unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually ( though tentatively at first ) accepts to look through again . Though it 's never explicitly spelt out , the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta , accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequence . A film without a single scene of sex or violence , a film that unfolds in it own time and concedes nothing to the spectator 's expectation , Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small , quiet , discreet Renaissance that ha been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70 . The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare , more La Vita è Bella-style film ... neglecting to explore fine creation like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore , L'Imbalsamatore and others . Your loss , world .",1
"I watched this film not really expecting much , I got it in a pack of 5 film , all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect ? and you know what I wa right , they were all terrible , this movie ha a few ( and a few is stretching it ) interesting point , the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch , the drummer is very like a drummer , i.e damned annoying and , well thats about it actually , the problem is that it just so boring , in what I can only assume wa an attempt to build tension , a whole lot of nothing happens and when it doe it utterly tedious ( I had my thumb on the fast forward button , ready to press for most of the movie , but gave it a go ) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking , coz they do n't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot , I thought he looked a bit like a meercat , all this and I have n't even mentioned the killer , I 'm not even gon na go into it , it just not worth explaining . Anyway a far a I 'm concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London ( who wa actually quite funny ) it wa n't because of their acting talent , I 've certainly seen a lot worse , but I 've also seen a lot better . Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry .",0
"I bought this film at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 , because it sounded interesting ( a bit Ranma-esque , with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton ) , because there wa a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back , and because there wa a Restricted Viewing sticker on it . I thought it wa going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge . I wa 100 % wrong . Having watched it , I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker , since there is hardly any foul language , little violence , and the closest thing to nudity ( Honestly ! I do n't usually go around hoping for it ! ) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panty ( you see her panty a lot in this movie , because no matter what , she 's wearing a miniskirt of some sort ) . Even the anti-religious humor is tame ( and lame , caricatured , insincere , derivative , unoriginal , and worst of all not funny in the slightest -- it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens ' `` Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show '' ) . This would barely qualify a PG-13 ( it is Not Rated ) , but Blockbuster refuse to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this -- a if it wa pornographic . Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream , but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse . It is , but not in that way . In a way , this worry me -- the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning . If anybody need to see movie with honestly portrayed suicide ( not this one , but better one like The Virgin Suicides ) , it 's teenager . If both of those movie were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect , then I have little chance of turning a story I 've been writing into a PG-13 movie ( the main character are eleven and a half and twelve ) . Suicide is one of the top three leading cause of death in teenager ( I think it 's number 2 ) , so chance are that most teen have been or will be affected by it . Just say no to this movie , though . 2/10 .",0
"The plot is about the death of little child . Hopper is the one who ha to investigate the killing . During the movie it appears that he ha some trouble with his daughter . In the end the serial killer get caught . That 's it . But before you find out who dunnit , you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actor . It is unbelievable how bad these actor are , including Hopper . I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time . Just do n't watch the movie . I 've warned you .",0
"Ever watched a movie that lost the plot ? Well , this did n't even really have one to begin with . Where to begin ? The achingly tedious scene of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorm ( that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing ) ? The house that is apparently only a few mile from a town yet is several hour walk away ( ? ) or the third girl who serf no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just a the tedium becomes unbearable ? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killing throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never venture far from the house ? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sum up most of the film inherent lack of direction . Add a lead actress who ca n't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scene and this video is truly nasty , but not in the way you hope . Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80 's ( mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder ) it offer nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft ' murder ( do n't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minute before ) . After a walk in the wood our victim come to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up . Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe . What do they do ? Slide down and run like the rest of u ? No , of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon . It really IS only a movie a they say ..",0
"Okay , so this series kind of take the route of 'here we go again ! ' Week in , week out David Morse 's character help out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what 's wrong with that ! ? David Morse is one of the greatest character actor out there , and certainly the coolest , and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven ! ! Due to the lack of love for this show by many , I ca n't see it going to a season series - but you never know ? The amount of rubbish that ha made it beyond that baffle me - let 's hope something good can make it past a first series ! ! !",1
"After sitting through this pile of dung , my husband and I wondered whether it wa actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie . It wa that listless and formulaic . But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film prof -- disappointingly -- that it 's the work of human . Call me a conspiracy theorist , but quote like , `` We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it '' seem like way to justify action like the invasion of Iraq , etc . The fact that Nicholas Cage spews line like , `` I would never use the Declaration of Independence a a bargaining chip '' with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene . The `` reasoning '' behind each plot turn and new `` clue '' is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow . And there 's also a bonus side plot of misogyny , with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for `` never shutting up . '' She 's clearly in the movie only for look , but they felt the need to slap a `` Dr. '' title on her character to give her some gravity . At one point , Cage 's character say , `` Do n't you ever shut up ? '' and the camera pan to her looking poutily down at her hand , like she 's a child . Truly grotesque . The only benefit to this movie wa that it 's so astonishingly bad , you do get a few laugh out of it . The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with u seemed to enjoy it . Creepy ....",0
"It had all the clichés of movie of this type and no substance . The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it . The production wa good ; however , the script and acting were B-movie quality . The casting wa poor because there were good actor mixed in with crumby actor . The good actor did n't hold their own nor did they lift up the others . This movie is not worthy of more word , but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten line . James Wood and Cuba Gooding , Jr. play caricature of themselves in other movie . If you are looking for mindless entertainment , I still would n't recommend this movie .",0
"This movie is based on the book , `` A Many Splendored Thing '' by Han Suyin and tackle issue of race relation between Asians and Whites , a topic that come from Han 's personal experience a an Eurasian growing up in China . That background , and the beautiful Hong Kong setting , give this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for it time . Other than that , the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself . The beautiful Jennifer Jones look the part and give a wonderful , Oscar nominated performance a a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China . William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead a a journalist covering war torn region in the world . The acting is top notch , and the chemistry between the two lover provides for some genuine moment of silver screen affection sure to melt the heart of those who are romantically inclined . The cinematography really brings out fifty 's Hong Kong , especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lover spend their most intimate moment . The ending is a real tear-jerker . Some may consider sentimental romance passé , but , for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love story , this is a shining example .",1
"Of all the film I have seen , this one , The Rage , ha got to be one of the worst yet . The direction , LOGIC , continuity , change in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain . `` How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy '' ? Gary Busey is know for his `` B '' movie , but this is a sure `` W '' movie . ( W=waste ) . Take for example : about two dozen FBI & local law officer surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer . Inside the jeep is MA and is `` confused '' a to why all the cop are about . Within second a huge gun battle ensues , MA being killed straight off . The cop blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them . The cop fall like domino and the jeep with Gary drive around in circle and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet . MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough . Truly a miracle , not since the six-shooter held 300 bullet ha there been such a miracle .",0
"I had heard good thing about `` States of Grace '' and came in with an open mind . I thought that `` God 's Army '' wa okay , and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured a a filmmaker . The film began with some shaky acting , and I thought , `` well , maybe it will get better . '' Unfortunately , it never did . The picture start out by introducing two elder -- Mormon missionary -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them . Instead , the story degenerate into a highly improbable series of unfortunate event highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionary ( something that undeniably exists , but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays ) and it becomes almost laughable . Dutcher 's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience . By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the life of Mormon missionary , Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience . The film in no way reflects reality . Missions are nothing like what Dutcher show ( having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact ) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity . The conclusion , which I 'm assuming wa supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all , wa both unbelievable ( c'mon , the entire mission gather to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other ! ) and cheesy . Next time , Dutcher , try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with .",0
"This movie struck home for me . Being 29 , I remember the '80 's and my father working in a factory . I figured , if I worked hard too , if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream , the house , a few kid , a car all to call my own . I 've noted however , without a degree in something ( unlike my father that quit at ninth grade ) and a keen sense of greed and laziness , you ca n't get anywhere . I would like to know if anyone ha this movie on DVD or VHS . it 's made for TV , and I just saw it an hour ago . Ic a n't find it anywhere ! I 'd love to show this to my friend , my pseudo friend , family and other relative , see what they think and remind them that once upon a time , Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished ! ! I think the feeling is still there , but in a heavy downward spiral with so many thing being made overseas ...",1
"As a disclaimer , I 've seen the movie 5-6 time in the last 15 year , and I only just saw the musical this week . This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what wa or wa n't in the musical ( however , it tainted me when I watched the musical : ) ) I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role , along with Kasey . I think her 'Let me dance for you scene ' is one of the best part of the movie , a worthwhile addition compared to the musical . The dancer and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical , a well a the cast which is at least 10 time bigger ( easier to do in the movie of course ) . The decor , lighting , dancing , and singing are also much superior in the movie , which should be expected , and wa indeed delivered . The song that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie , the new one are quite good one , and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion , especially compared to a musical which ha few decor . The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cut between the actor talking , and dubbed singer during the singing portion for some of the character , but their dancing is impeccable , and the end product wa more enjoyable than the musical",1
Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it star Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actor . The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary . The story go downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie 's charm just doe n't save this movie . Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan do n't go out of your way to see this film .,0
"How this film could be classified a Drama , I have no idea . If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen , I would be trying to erase this from my CV . It wa a historically accurate a Xena and Hercules . Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah . Lot , Abraham 's nephew , Lot , turn up thousand of year before he would have been born . Canaanites wandered the earth ... really ? What were the scriptwriter thinking ? Was it just ignorance ( `` I remember something about Noah and animal , and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School '' ) or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet a possible- from Christians , Jews and Muslims , to historian , archaeologist , geologist , psychologist , linguist ... a a matter of fact , did anyone not get offended ? Anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one !",0
"Preston Sturgis ' THE POWER AND THE GLORY wa unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty year until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television . In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael 's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE wa based on Sturgis ' screenplay here . As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site , Kael overstated her case . There are about six narrator who take turn dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane : the newsreel ( representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone ) , Thatcher 's memoir , Bernstein , Jed Leland , Susan Alexander Kane , and Raymond the butler . Each ha his or her different slant on Kane , reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man . And of course each also reveals his or her own failing when they are telling their version of Kane 's story . This method also lead to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident . This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY . Yes , like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner ( Spencer Tracy ) , a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country . But there are only two narrator - they are Garner 's right hand man Henry ( Ralph Morgan ) and his wife ( Sarah Padden ) . This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at time of Kane in Garner . Henry , when he narrates , is talking about his bos and friend , whom he respected and loved . His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she see only the flaw in Henry . Typical example : Although he worked his way up , Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later year . Unions are troublemaker , and he doe not care to be slowed down by their shenanigan . Henry describes Tom 's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out , and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life . But Henry 's wife reminds him how Tom used scab and violence to end the strike ( apparently blowing up the Union 's headquarters - killing many people ) . So we have two view of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black . I 'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE 's success ( few film do - including all of Orson Welles ' other film ) , but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one 's interest to the end . And thanks to the performance of Tracy and Colleen Moore a his wife Sally , the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home . When they marry , Tom want to do well ( in part ) to give his wife and their family the benefit he never had . But in America great business success come at a cost . Tom get deeply involved with running the railroad empire ( he expands it and improves it constantly ) . But it take him away from home too much , and he loses touch with Sally . And he also notice Eve ( Helen Vinson ) , the younger woman who becomes his mistress . When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her . Similarly Tom too get a full shock ( which make him a martyr in the eye of Henry ) . Eve marries Tom , and present him with a son - but it turn out to be Eve 's son by Tom 's son Tom Jr. ( Philip Trent ) . The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding cause Tom to shoot himself . The film is not a total success - the action jump at time unconvincingly . Yet it doe make the business seem real ( note the scene when Tom tell his Board of Directors about his plan to purchase a small rival train line , and he discus the use of debenture for financing the plan ) . Sturgis came from a wealthy background , so he could bring in this type of detail . So on the whole it is a first rate film . No CITIZEN KANE perhaps , but of interest to movie lover a an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America .",1

"Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movie which Shaw produce back in the 70 and 80 , whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti western of Hollywood , and the protagonist Gordon Liu , the counterpart to the western 's Clint Eastwood . Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest , this is `` Presented in Shaw Scope '' , just like the good old day . This film is a simple story of good versus evil , told in 3 act , which more or le sum up the narrative of martial art film in that era . Act One set up the premise . Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot , having their wage cut by 20 % by incoming manchu gangster . They ca n't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial art skilled to take on the gangster , and their bos . At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk ( one of the best comedy sequence ) , but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many time . Act Two show the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob . However , without real martial art , he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple , to try and infiltrate and learn martial art on the sly . After some slapstick moment , he finally get accepted by the abbot ( whom he impersonated ! ) but is disappointed at the teaching method - kinda like Mr Miyagi 's style in Karate Kid , but instead of painting fence , he get to erect scaffolding all around the temple . Nothing can keep a good man down , and he unwittingly build strength , endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way . Act Three is where the fight fest begin . With cheesy sound effect , each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment . But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scene here , with it wide angled shot to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partner , and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunt in different angle . You may find the speed of fight a tad too slow , with some pause in between move , but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flick , they sure do n't make fight scene like they used to ! Return to the 36th chamber get a repeat screening on Monday , so , if you 're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane , what are you waiting for ?",1

"The 33 percent of the nation nitwit that still support W.

It 's really a shame that when a politician ruin the country , those who voted for him ca n't be denied the right to ever vote again . They 've clearly shown they have no sense of character . What really stand out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character a hopelessly doctrinaire a Robespierre ; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology ca n't help him elucidate the boundary between safety and totalitarianism .

Sound like any belligerent , overprivileged , retarded Yale cheerleader you know of ? Wojciech Pszoniak blow the slovenly Deparidieu off the screen . As sympathetic a Robespierres plight is , it 's comforting to know that shortly after the film end he 'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine .",0
"As someone ha already mentioned on this board , it 's very difficult to make a fake documentary . It requires tremendous skill , pacing , patience , directorial 'distance , ' a plausible premise , a narrative 'flow , ' and REALLY believable acting ( aka GREAT acting ) . Such is not the case with 'Love Machine ' . It start to show it faux hand about the 20-minute mark ( with 60 minute left to watch ) , and the viewer start to realize that he or she is being taken in . It 's downhill from there . Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon . But to be fair to Eriksen , his problem started early : a he explains in the extra , he began wanting to do a REAL doc , could n't get funding , and settled for a cheaper way of making his film . The premise -- people who have secret life by posting themselves on a porn website -- wa perhaps more interesting in 1997-98 , when the film wa made . Eriksen doe a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host , ' hand-held camera , zoom , grainy black and white -- all , I guess , to elicit a sense of authenticity , but it just doe n't work . The film is confusing and forced , but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actor and the pretty awful dialogue .",0
"The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more . Of course it 's not going to be an Oscar nominated film , it 's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minute . The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainee who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbilly on their last day of training in the desert . It 's just them fighting back throughout the whole film , which includes a lot of violence ( which is basically the whole film ) a blood and gut are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing , and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience . I 'd give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment , and that only . Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more a the film went on , a it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stay awake . The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment , something to pas time if you 're bored , and nothing else . 4/10",0
"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie . It 's so unbelievable . A woman leaf her husband after many year of marriage , ha a breakdown in front of a real estate office . What happens ? The office manager come outside and offer her a job ! ! ! Hilarious ! Next thing you know the two woman are going at it . Yep , they 're lesbian ! Nothing ring true in this `` Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do '' movie . Clunky dialogue like `` I do n't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and did n't take it '' doe n't help . There 's a wealthy , distant mother who disapproves of her daughter 's new relationship . A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003 , a film get made in which there 's a sassy black maid . Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave . The woman ha a husband who freak out and want custody of the snotty teenage kid . Sheesh ! No cliche is left unturned .",0
"NO SPOILERS ! ! After Hitchcock 's successful first American film , Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMarier 's lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue , he returned to some of the more familiar theme of his early British period - mistaken identity and espionage . As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort ' of civilian building plane , weaponry and other necessary militia , the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thriller with war time theme . These thriller often involved network of deceptive and skilled operator at work in the shadow among the good , law abiding citizen . Knowing the director wa at home in this espionage genre , producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption , war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity . The darker element of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker ( during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian root in NYC ) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock 's sensibility . This often neglected film tell the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane ( Robert Cummings ) who , while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory , meet new employee Frank Frye ( Norman Lloydd ) and moment later is framed for committing sabotage . Fleeing the authority who do n't believe his far-fetched story he meet several character on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City . These memorable character include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks ' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin ( Priscilla Lane ) who , during the worst crisis of his life a well a national security , he fall madly in love with ! Of course in the land of Hitchcock , Patricia , kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry , fall for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix . In good form for this outing , Hitchcock brew a national network of demure old lady , average Joes , and respectable businessmen who double a secret agent terrorist that harbor criminal , pull gun and detonate bomb to keep thing moving . It 's a terrific plot that take it time moving forward and once ignited , culminates in one of Hitchcock 's more memorable finale . Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attraction ( all of which were recreated by art director in Hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban ' on public attraction ) . While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock 's most well known film , it 's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twist and a usual - terrific Hitchcock villain . Remember to look for Hitchcock 's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film . Hitchcock 's original cameo idea that wa shot ( him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf ' wife ) wa axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf !",1
"I just watched The Dresser this evening , having only seen it once before , about a dozen year ago . It 's not a `` big '' movie , and doe n't try to make a big splash , but my God , the brilliance of the two lead leaf me just about speechless . Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing le than amazing in this movie . The Dresser is the story of Sir , an aging Shakespearean actor ( Finney ) , and his dresser Norman ( Courtenay ) , sort of a valet , putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II . These are two men , each dependent upon the other : Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole , wheedle , and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear . And Norman life his life vicariously through Sir ; without Sir to need him , he is nothing , or think he is , anyway . This is a character-driven film ; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the character , and a such , it requires actor of the highest caliber to bring it to life . Finney , only 47 year old , is completely believable a a very old , very sick , petulant , bullying , but brilliant stage actor . He hiss and fume at his fellow actor even when they 're taking their bow ! And Courtenay is no le convincing a the mincing dresser , who must sometimes act more a a mother than a a valet to his elderly employer . Employer is really the wrong term to use , though . For although , technically their relationship is that of employer and employee , most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much a an old married couple . Yes , there are others in the cast of this movie , but there is no question that the true star are Finney , Courtenay , and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood . That is not to say that there are n't other fine performance , most notably Eileen Atkins a the long-suffering stage manager Madge . There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desire , old regret , and what might have been . Although it doe n't get talked about these day , it is worth remembering that The Dresser wa nominated for five Academy Awards : Best Actor nomination for both Finney and Courtenay , Best Picture , Best Director ( Peter Yates ) , and Best Adapted Screenplay . I had remembered this a being a good movie , but I wa n't prepared to be a completely mesmerized a I wa from beginning to end . If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about , and be hugely entertained all the while , then I encourage you to see The Dresser .",1
"What happened ? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast , but somewhere the movie loses it . Actually , it never really got going . There wa a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant , then find out that she is after all , but that wa it . Steve Martin , who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie , wa dreadful and his entire character wa not even close to being important to this movie , other than to make it longer . I really would have liked to see more interaction between the main character , Kate and Angie , and maybe try not for a pure comedy , which unfortunately it wa not , but maybe a drama with comedic element . I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actress are quite funny in their own way and sitting here I can think of numerous scenario that would have been a riot .",0
"I 've just watched Fingersmith , and I 'm stunned to see the 8/10 average rating for the show . Not only wa the plot wa difficult to follow , but it seems character development wa randomly applied . The actor were adequate , but in the process of attempting to create twist and turn , their character are rendered entirely one dimensional . Once this happens , the story really fall flat and becomes tedious . And just in case anyone did n't see the predictable lesbian undertone from mile way , this is hammered home in the most banal term at the end of the film . The end scene is disappointing and phoned in , and anyone who sat back and went `` Ohhh , so they were carpet muncher all along ! `` , must have been out for the evening . Two star for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which wa at least a bit raunchy , none for the rest of it ...",0
"So let 's begin ! ) ) ) The movie itself is a original a Cronenberg 's movie would usually appear ... My intention to see it wa certainly JJL being one of my favourite actress . She is a lovely a usual , this cutie ! I would not say it wa my favourite movie of hers . Still it 's quite interesting and entertaining to follow . The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array . ; ) Recommend with confidence ! ) ) ) )",1

An unmarried woman named Stella ( Bette Midler ) get pregnant by a wealthy man ( Stephen Collins ) . He offer to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turn him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own . Things go OK until the child named Jenny ( Trini Alvarado ) becomes a teenager and thing gradually ( and predictably ) become worse . I 've seen both the silent version and sound version of `` Stella Dallas '' . Neither one affected me much ( and I cry easily ) but they were well-made if dated . Trying to remake this in 1990 wa just a stupid idea . I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of `` Beaches '' to get this made . This ( predictably ) bombed . The story is laughable and dated by today 's standard . Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performance this film really drag and I wa bored silly by the end . Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason ( both good actor ) do n't help in supporting role . Flimsy and dull . Really -- who thought this would work ? See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead . I give this a 1 .,0
"DO N'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci 's earlier ( and honestly , in term of story-line , better ... ) film - and although not the typical `` bloodbath '' that Fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film . The story surround a small town where a series of child murder are occurring . Some of the colorful character involved in the investigation - either a suspect , or those `` helping '' the investigation ( or in some case both ) - include the town police force , a small-time reporter , a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict , a young priest and his mother , An old man who practice witchcraft and his female protégé , a mentally handicapped townsman , and a deaf/mute little girl . All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twist and turn , until the actual killer is revealed ... DO N'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a `` classical '' giallo or a typical Fulci gore film . Although it doe contain element of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery , with darker subject matter and a few scene of graphic violence ( although nothing nearly a strong a some of Fulci 's later work ) . This is a well written film with lot of twist that kept me guessing up until the end . Recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fan , or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci 's non-splatter film - but do n't despair , DO N'T TORTURE still ha more than it 's fair share of violence and sleaze . Some may be put off by the subject of the child killing , and one main female character ha a strange habit of hitting on very young boy , which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doe n't bother you , then definitely give this one a look . 8.5/10",1
"Busty beauty Stacie Randall play PVC clad , bad-ass bitch Alexandra , the faithful acolyte of Faust , an evil entity trapped in hell . Determined to free her master , the malevolent minx break into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success ; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust , the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she ha drawn on the floor , which result in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive , troll-like creature called Lite and Dark . Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem , which is n't going to be easy : the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover , police detective Jonathan Graves ( Peter Liapis ) , who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who know only too well what evil Alexandra is capable of . Meanwhile , wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pint Lite and Dark get into all sort of zany trouble a they try to find a way back home . In the warped movie world of Jim Wynorski , all female are big-breasted babe with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker . Ghoulies IV is no exception : every woman in this filmwhether she be a police captain , a curator of antiquity , or a mental patient in an asylumis hot , hot , hot and wear not a lot , and it 's this fact that make this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of STV crap just about bearable . But be warned , even though the presence of semi-naked , quality crumpet make the going slightly easier , there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled a an ordeal : the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful ; the black humour ( a the DVD blurb describes it ) is about a funny a a knee to the knacker , with the comedic banter of Lite and Dark being particularly cringe-worthy ; and the special effect are bargain basement , consisting of rubbery creature and visual effect that would have looked dated ten year earlier . 3/10 solely for the high bimbo quotient .",0
"I really like Salman Kahn so I wa really disappointed when I seen this movie . It did n't have much of a plot and what they did have wa not that appealing . Salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but wa worth the price of this DVD . The music wa not bad it wa quite nice . Usually Indian movie are at least two to three hour long but this wa a very short movie for an Indian film . The American actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes , Ali Larter . Her acting had a lot to be desired . However she did look good in the Indian dress that she wore . All the movie had not a lot to be desired and I hope Salman doe a lot better on his next movie . Thank you .",0
"I 'm not sure why the producer needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movie .. which it is not . Even though Marques Houston did appear in `` HP3 '' , he played a totally different character ( he wa , eight year older ) in this film . Okay ... so Reid and Martin were n't the most talented and could n't carry a film all by themselves .. but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference ( albeit minor ) to the earlier movie . I 'm sure everyone who wanted to see it wa `` hoodwinked '' -- into thinking that they were seeing a sequel -- not a totally different film with a familiar name . And I 'm sorry ... Kym Whitley is not funny , and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris , Ketty Lester , or DC Curry in the earlier film . Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion ... I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN ! ! Just naming the film `` Down to the Last Minute '' would have been OK . Furthermore , the Hudlin brother ( who produced the first three movie ) were not involved in the making of this film .",0
"This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story line and shallow character ever seen . The writer obviously bought the playbook `` How to write a space disaster movie '' and followed it play by play . In particular , the stereo-typical use of astronaut talking to their loved one from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - ha been done time and time again . Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producer would throw $ 50 million at the project . But , judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempt at special effect , the producer could only muster $ 50 thousand . To learn that the film wa nominated for a `` Special Visual Effects '' Emmy ha me absolutely gob-smacked . I think a handful of high school student with a pas in Media Studies could have created more believable effect ! And the plot hole are too numerous to mention . But I will pick one out a an example . Now , I 'm no NASA expert , but surely it 's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when thing start to go pear-shaped with the program . Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who ha not been in the control room before . The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell . He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script . I give this film 2 out of 10 , with the above-average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark .",0
"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up . Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason , while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield . Ty Webb is funny , being the only character from the original . Most of the other character in the movie lack the punch of the original ( Henry Wilcoxon for example ) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt , being played by Randy Quaid . Every line he say reminds me of the original humor , especially the scene at his office ( I do n't go in for law suit or motion . I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f * * * ing baseball bat , make a bonfire with the chippindale , maybe roast that golden retriever ( arff arff arff ) then eat it . And then I 'm comin ' upstairs junior , and I 'm grabbing you by your brook brother pjs , and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a * * ! Do we have an understanding ? ) . Offsetting his small role however , is Dan Acroyd , who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray . His voice is beyond irritating and everything he doe isnt even funny , it just stupid . Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie , but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it .",0
"Honestly - this short film suck . the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience . the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I have n't made up my mind if this help or hinders it . If the film wa a little grainy it might have added some `` creepiness factor '' to what wa going on . I have no idea why this film ha so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scene in film like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others , are more shocking than in AFTERMATH . All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull * * * * . This is an expensive , beautifully filmed turd . It 's not that shocking , it 's not that disgusting . if you insist on viewing it - rent it . I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movie about necrophilia ( there should definitely be a bigger selection for u sickos ; ) - the filming is good and it doe have some `` gore '' ( if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore ... ) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess . On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda 's `` sequel '' to AFTERMATH ( now available a a `` double feature '' released by Unearthed film ) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film , really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material . Although I do n't care for AFTERMATH at all , GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future ...",0
"I thought that Mukhsin ha been wonderfully written . Its not just about entertainment . There 's tonne of subtle message that i think Yasmin wa trying to bring across . And yes , it might be confusing to some of you ( especially if you did n't watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 time ) . I bet u noticed how they use character from the two movie before right ? Its really ironic how the character relate . Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra . And the chick at the snooker pad turn out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future . And i absolutely love the voice-overs . Its crude yet awakeningly fresh . Like , when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard , then there wa suddenly Mukhsin 's voice saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .. ' ( the scene when he climbed the tree ) . It captured Malaysian 's attitude ( and in some mild way , sniggering at how pathetic it is ) portrayed in the character . For example , even the kid can be really sharp tongued ( complete with the shrill annoying voice ) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long . And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl , when ur own life is n't sorted out . All i can say is , this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it . It kept me glued to the screen , i could n't even take my eye off it . Not even to make out in the cinema . Ha ha .",1
"I am not a golf fan by any mean . On May 26 about 10:30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800 's . Old movie I like but not golf however , within the first scene a young boy ( Harry Vardon ) is awaken by the voice of men . He go outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something ... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it wa back on . The movie is excellent . We then see this young boy now a man ; professional golf player who is haunted with vision from his childhood . Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decision he make for golf . You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period . Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging word and little push that are instrumental in Francis winning . Do n't want to give away too much . I wa up until 2 A.M . This is super please see the movie .",1
"Upon viewing Tobe Hooper 's gem , Crocodile , in 2000 , I developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre . I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequel to these delightful bonbon of camp goodness . If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable script . With Ed writing the script , and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effect on a computer , all we 'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breast and Ren Hoek pectoral implant . While Tobe Hooper 's crocky opus referenced his own movie , Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging theme from the chum bucket of other movie . See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel set to find the allusions/homages ? /rip-offs to Jaws , Temple of Doom , Indiana Jones ' Last Crusade , The Convent , Godzilla 2000 , and any James Bond movie . Also , try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock . I wa disappointed the crock did n't get to try out it sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism ... or crocky appreciation , but the quasi-Captain Ahab of the story doe get his tour de force speach . Perhaps , in the coming year , we 'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset . Or hopefully , a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midget and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-G monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed . All-in-all , the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me .",0
"It try to be the epic adventure of the century . And with a cast like Shô Kasugi , Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time . It 's actually is a pretty fun , swashbuckling adventure that , even with it 's flaw , capture your interest . It must have felt a the biggest movie ever for the people who made it . Even if it 's made in the 90 , it doe n't have a modern feel . It more ha the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had . Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I 'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same a these old movie had . This on the other hand , just ha the real feeling . You just ca n't hate it . I think it 's an okay adventure movie . And I really love the soundtrack . Damn , I want the theme song .",1
"The Last Hard Men find James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang . Do he and his friend head for the Mexican border from jail and safety . No they do n't because Coburn ha a mission of revenge . To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman . That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he know what Coburn is after . As he explains it to his daughter , Barbara Hershey , Coburn wa holed up in a shack and wa involved in a Waco like standoff . His Indian woman wa killed in the hail of bullet fired . It 's not something he 's proud of , she wa a collateral casualty in a manhunt . Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he let u know full well what an evil man he truly is . Heston is his usual stalwart hero , but the acting honor in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn . He blow everyone else off the screen when he 's on . Coburn get the bright idea of making sure Heston trail him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authority ca n't touch him . He know that Heston ha to make it personal then . Coburn 's gang includes , Morgan Paull , Thalmus Rasulala , John Quade , Larry Wilcox , and Jorge Rivero . Heston ha Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be . The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western . Andrew McLaglen directed it and I 'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh . It sure show a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence . Of which there is a lot . For a little Peckinpaugh lite , The Last Hard Men is your film .",1
"Maybe it wa the title , or the trailer ( certainly not the interview on the DVD , which is with the director a he keep saying `` hi , kid '' into the camera like a buffoon ) , but I had expectation for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scene and brutal , bloody killing by a weird Japanese penetrator . Turns out it 's way too sleazy for it own good , or bad , or whatever . There 's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust , similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence . Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno , and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movie ! And with the killing scene , there ha to be at least a little tack , and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity , in creating the creature/killer/whatever . Entrails of a Virgin ha neither . It 's safe to say it 's a pretty soulless movie , even if is n't one of the very worst ever made- it 's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishist to get off on girl in trouble and men who have all their brain in their 'other ' head . In this case , we 're given a photo team where the guy are taking some shot of some girl , nothing too salacious , and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by `` A Murderer '' a he 's credited . First off , the director Kazuo 'Gaira ' Komizu decides he ha to put in a quota of random sex scene early on- we get spliced in ( or phoned in , take your pick ) clip of one of the photographer having sex with one or more of the girl elsewhere . It look like it 's from another movie . Then once settled into the house , there 's a 'wrestling ' scene that 's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah , we really need to see him 'all ' there ) , and then on to the rape and killing . First the rape , by the photographer , who promise the girl some job for their time . Then the Murderer , who like D'Amato 's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial , and who for an unknown reason kill the men and/or rape the woman one by one . Now , the latter of those , taken by themselves , should be considered the highlight of the movie . This is like saying , however , that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad . An eye-gouging scene , a spike thrown like an Olympic event ( that scene , actually , is kind of cool ) , and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl , whose inconsequential name I ca n't remember . Even * this * becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title ! On top of this , the sex scene , which become tedious through 'Gaira ' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censor is blurred anyway , are dubbed over by the actor ( you 'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough , hence the need to let them 'speak ' for themselves ) . But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one , where it 's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror ( watch a the last girl left alive , the virgin of the picture , try to stop the murderer from getting to her , which last five minute a she keep throwing stick at him ! ) You just want it to be done with , for the ' I hate woman ' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether .",0
"The few scene that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming hole . When Sharif or , please God , Palance try their hand at fiery oratory , they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug . The display of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean , and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pas . What doe that leave u with ? One comical dentistry scene ; a surfeit of uppity Hollywood peasant who address the camera a though it were a moving train ; and , just for kick , a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castro 's manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio . Never trust a Medved , but even a busted clock is right twice a day : this is a HISTORICALLY awful movie .",0
"This film took me by surprise . I make it a habit of finding out a little a possible about film before attending because trailer and review provide spoiler after spoiler . All I knew upon entering the theater is that it wa a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb reader gave it a 7.8 , Rotten Tomatoes user ranked it at 7.9 and the critic averaged an amazing 8.2 ! If anything , they UNDERRATED this little gem . Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parent `` for posterity '' and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interview with his parent , outspoken mother Mina , and le than forthcoming dad , Mike . I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker ( Mike & Mina 's son Doug ) wa going to take u . As a matter of fact , I doubt that Doug himself knew where he wa going with this ! Life take unexpected twist and turn and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey . It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I wa with this story and the unique way in which it wa told . Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you are n't a fan of the documentary genre . This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memory that you thought were long forgotten . `` 51 Birch Street '' is one of those rare filmgoing experience that make a deep impression and never leaf you . The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience , eventually , million of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work . BRAVO ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !",1
"Stephen Hawkings is a genius . He is the king of genius . Watching this movie make me feel dumb . But it 's a great movie . Not highly entertaining , but very very intriguing . The movie center around wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings , a man who make Einstein look average , and his theory and scientific discovery about the universe , time , the galaxy , and black hole . Everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high come to a moment when they think they ' v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear a soon a they sober up they 'll write it all down . Well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hour . Here is a man who despite suffering from Lou Gehrig 's disease ha become the greatest mind the world ha yet seen . Watch this and listen in on how he ha formulated theory on black hole . Awesome . You wo n't be the same after you see it .",1
"The story is about a psychic woman , Tory , who return to her hometown and begin reliving her traumatic childhood past ( the death of her childhood friend and abusive father ) . Tory discovers that her friend wa just the first in a string of murder that are still occurring . Can her psychic power help solve the crime and stop the continuing murder ? You really do n't need to find out because , Oh My God ! This wa so so so so bad ! I know all the Nora Roberts fan will flock to this movie and give it ton of 10 's . Then the rest of u will see an IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching . But do not be fooled . The ending wa predictable , the acting TERRIBLE ( do n't even get me started about the southern accent * y'all * ) and the story wa trite . Just remember .... you were warned !",0
"Oh God , I must have seen this when I wa only 11 or twelve , ( do n't ask how ) I may have been young , but I wa n't stupid . Anyone could see that this is a bad movie , nasty , gross , unscary and very silly . I 've seen more impressive effect at Disneyland , I 've seen better performance at a school play , And I 've seen more convincing crocodile at the zoo , where they do nothing but sit in the water , ignoring the child tapping on the glass . The story is set in northern Australia . A handful of ambitious young people , are trying out a new water sport , surfing in shark filled water . It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water . After they learn what , they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman , who want to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family . I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen year , the best of which is Lake Placid , and the worse of which is it sequel . Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think , with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind . The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creature out there , resulting in more than a hundred injury or death every year . Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature , but a good hour and a half of the viewer 's life . Unless you really want to see it , avoid Blood Surf .",0
"`` Fate '' lead Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that ha eerie similarity and connection to his life , all based around the number 23 . As the story unfolds in real life and fiction , Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end . The Number 23 offer an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution . The film just failed on many different level which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential . The screenplay wa probably the worst part about it . It wa filled with silly sequence and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie . It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea , he just did n't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time . The second half of the film wa running low on idea , the twist wa pretty obvious and the ending wa awful . Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movie ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other film but The Number 23 reminds me that he 's still capable of making a stinker . He ha the movie drenched in style but he just ca n't get a good focus . He move the film at a clunky and slow pace . He switch from reality to what 's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying . The actual book in the film that 's titled `` The Number 23 '' is an awful detective story and the audience get stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tear . When Carrey is finally done with book , we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery . At this point , the audience ha lost interest and there is no real tension . We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it 's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film ha finally finished . The acting wa mostly average and pretty forgettable . Jim Carrey wa clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he did n't even seem to be trying . He wa either completely over the top in some scene or just very wooden . His narration wa a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character . Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she need to pick better script . Logan Lerman wa pretty bland a wa Danny Huston . Overall , The Number 23 wa an awful thriller that offered more laugh than suspense or thrill . Rating 3/10",0
"We brought this film a a joke for a friend , and could of been our worst joke to play . The film is barely watchable , and the acting is dire . The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance . The plot is disgraceful and at point we wa so bored we wa wondering what the hell wa going on . It try to be gruesome in place but is just laughable . Just terrible",0
This wa probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life ! ! It wa stupid there wa no plot and the special affect were ridiculous ! ! And i have never seen such bad acting in my life ! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guy ( especially Drew Fuller ) . I do n't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie ! ! I did n't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guy are all in bed touching themselves . I mean it wa like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn ! I would advise anyone who ha heard of this movie and wa interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch ! I wa very disappointed ! ! The whole movie wa a complete waste of time in my opinion .,0
"This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds . I would n't call this a spoiler because anyone who ha read a Steele novel know how they ALL end . If you do n't want to know much about the plot , do n't keep reading . Gilbert 's character , Ophelia , is a woman of French decent who ha lost her husband and son in an accident . Gilbert need to stop doing film where she is required to have an accent because she , otherwise a good actress , can not realistically pull off any kind of accent . Brad Johnson , also an excellent actor , is Matt , who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce . He is gentle , convincing and compelling in this role . The two meet on the beach through her daughter , Pip , and initially , Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid . All of them become friend after this episode and then the couple fall in love . The chemistry between the two lead is not great , even though the talent of these two people is not , in my opinion , a question . They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that border on stereotypical . Two people meet , tragedy , bigger tragedy , a secret is revealed , another tragedy , and then they get together . I wish there wa more to it than that , but there it is in a nutshell . I wanted mindless entertainment , and I got it with this . In regard to the genre of romantic film , this one fails to be memorable . `` A Secret Affair '' with Janine Turner is far superior ( not a Steele book ) , a are some of Steele 's earlier book turned into film .",0
Oh no one of these attack of the Japanese ghost girl movie ... i do n't even remember how many i 've seen . maybe it sell ... but not to me . not scary at all . the japanese horror movie are have been very similar since the first one of these ... also the pulling of the kid . i have seen that pulled under scene so many time in so many horror movie . cellphone scene is also nothing new ... the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked ... i mean it lacked all dramaticness ... OK this is for kid 14-16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique ... we 'll let me tell you . there 's a million of you =D this is one of them . 3/10 i 've seen worse but you wo n't be missing anything by NOT seeing this !,0
"Nicholas Walker is Paul , the local town Reverand who 's married to Martha ( Ally Sheedy ) , but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair , Veronica ( Dara Tomanovich ) . However in so doing , he get a bout of amnesia ( hence the name of the film ) . Sally Kirkland is also on hand a a crazy old coot who pine for the good Reverand in a shade of `` Misery '' type of way . It 's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this . Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role a a shoddy private investigator . In a film billed a a 'black comedy ' , one ha to bring BOTH element into said movie . While this doe bring the former in spade , it sadly contains none of the latter . Furthermore you ca n't emphasize with any of the character and a thus , have absolutely no vested interest in them . Technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one . Eye Candy : Dara Tomanovich get topless ; Sally Kirkland also show some skin My Grade : C- Where I saw it : Showtime Showcase",0
"Hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world . It only need a single hit to flood theater with the same old crap re-invented over and over again . Take superheroes for example , for each X-Man and Spiderman , there are Daredevil , Elektra , Ghost Rider and Hulk . Japanese horror remake are even worst . It only took The Ring , which wa pitch-perfect ( mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky ) , to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horror , e.g . The Ring 2 , The Eye , Dark Water ( which wa fine , but pointless ) , and the grudge . The first Grudge wa n't entirely bad . It wa scary most of the way , which is what one could expect from it . Plus , the plot had some brain mixing narrative . Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous ; this could be a good thing , but hey , what boy Men in Black II ? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain ? For the Grudge 2 , the critic go the same way . Tired scare , bad acting ( except for Amber Tamblyn ) , and clichés all over the place . Three story take place , on different place and time . There is Aubrey ( Tamblyn ) investigating what drove her sister Karen ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) to death ; Allison ( Arielle Kebbel ) who is taken by colleague to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place ; and finally , an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door . Glad to say ( and I mean it ) that everything is tied up at the end , but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture , when everything else is simply tiresome and dull . The chill are all over there , a girl alone in the locker , someone who should n't enter a house , others that dig too deep . Meanwhile , ghost keep killing and killing and killing , which seems even more deadlier than ten world war or the Ebola epidemic . Hey , doe n't that seem just like another bad Japanese remake , something called Pulse ? Yeah , day after day it 's getting easier to hold a grudge ... against Hollywood bullshit .",0
"`` Down Periscope '' ha been in our library since it first arrived in VHS . Since then , we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now . It is a quirky flick that doe not go militarily overboard a either pro or con . It is first and foremost a comedy and a a vehicle for the main character , I am quite surprised that a sequel ha never been offered . The movie ha gained a following that border on a cult obsession , even among the very young . I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile , Alabama in 2002 . A group of Cub Scouts , my grandson among them , had all taken up the role from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board . It is a fun romp that make you proud both of our Navy and Hollywood ... which is rare company . Thanks to Kelsey Grammar , Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie , such great entertainment !",1
"If you came here , it 's because you 've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it . I feel for you , I * really * do . And I profusely apologize a a Canadian ( because that 's what we do ) that this film ever had to cross your eye , if only for a moment . I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen case . I , like everyone else , rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade . I thought , `` sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie . '' I 'll give the creator of this film ONE positive comment about their 'creation ' : Thanks for removing the REC XX/XX/XX from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen . I can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie . And for the record , I * saw * the movie , but did not watch it . The dialogue wa incoherent and most of the scene took place in my grandmother 's trailer , I swear to God . You know what ? I 'm not writing anymore about this . It 's just too painful .",0
"Deanna Durbin , Nan Grey and Barbara Read are `` Three Smart Girls '' in this Universal film from 1936 , which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audience . It also star Ray Milland , Mischa Auer , Charles Winninger , John King , Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady . It 's a sweet story about three young woman , now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother , who hear their father ( Winninger ) is marrying again . Not having seen him in 10 year and knowing their mother still love him , they board a ship to America , with the help of the housekeeper/nanny , determined to stop the wedding . Realizing that the intended , called `` Precious '' ( Barnes ) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother ( Brady ) , they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count . This is arranged by their father 's accountant ( King ) . The man he chooses is a full-time drunk ( Auer ) , but the girl mistake him for an actual wealthy count ( Milland ) . What a mess . This is a delightful film , not cloying or overly sugary at all , with some nice performance , particularly by Auer , Milland , Barnes and Brady . The young woman are pretty and all do good work . The emphasis , of course , is on young Durbin , who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer . In fact , her voice a a youngster is much more even than it would be a an adult - she ha no trouble with the high note , a she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice . She sings a delightful `` Il Bacio '' in a police station . One of the nicest thing about the film is to see the father , played by Charles Winninger , not want his child around - until he see them and get to know them . Barnes a the gold-digger is n't all that young , but the girl ' mother look way up there , so the inference probably wa the older man seeking his youth with a younger , more glamorous woman . In fact , he find the youth he wa seeking in his daughter . Universal give Durbin the big star buildup here - she ha the final shot in the movie . Ray Milland at this point wa still paying his due , and it will probably be a surprise even to film fan how young and attractive he is . Very entertaining and of course , this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna .",1
"If anyone is wondering why no one make movie like they used to , with conversation , character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new , better and different , those folk need to take in this film and see top notch writing , directing , and acting that meld into a wonderful evening of observation on how thing used to be in Italy and England . Other day , other time funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment , made in 1992 with Alfred Molina , Joan Plowright , Polly Walker , Josie Lawrence , Jim Broadbent , Miranda Richardson , and Michael Kitchens in the major role . Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell , these actor accomplish vividly memorable performance that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter 's eye . Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century , this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character , and the viewer , too . An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around u .",1
"I watched this series out of curiosity , wanting to see if they could possibly and with ALL this modern technology , out do Cecil B. DeMille 's classic epic of 1956 , starring Charleton Heston , Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke . Of course , I wa let down . Yes , they had all the Biblical character correct , but they did n't give u any of the spectacular theatrical scene , that held your interest throughout the first movie . If you going to have a mini-series , you have to have some `` rivoting '' scene , the `` Burning bush '' , Parting the `` RED Sea '' , drowning `` Pharohs Armies '' , `` building Sethi 's Pyramids '' , could have been done with today ' technology on the scale of blockbuster movie such a `` Lord of the Rings '' or the Matrix . Obviously , they did n't want to leave a LASTING impression of `` faith and sacrifice '' , which is much needed in these trouble time .",0
"Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive . English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View , passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father , an impudent , violent butcher in Gangs of New York ( in a performance ten time stronger than Adrian Brody 's in the Pianist ) and a the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot ( just to name a few ) . His role all influence eachother , but each is seperate , and utterly unique . He change completely , with each character he take on . And I 'm beginning to believe that he can act a anything . Anything . As Cristy Brown he is stunning . He doe not ridicule the character , and he doe not pity the character . A difficult achievement . And Cristy Brown come to life . A smart man . An outrageous man . Human . This movie , despite small scene-transition fault and the like , is an inspiration . Yes , it 's predictable . But is it stupidly sentimental ? No . I laughed . I cried . Not a single moment of cheese . Proof that this is n't a Hollywood movie . My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant , when Cristy is discussing painter with Eileen , Peter and her friend . Here 's where Daniel Day-Lewis reach an acting climax . `` I 'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that 's animated . '' `` Wheel out the cripple ! '' And his performance never slows down , never falter , and is beautiful . Simply . He ha a lot of screen time here . I watch it again again , and I never get tired of Cristy 's perspicacious eye , twitching and guttural speech . A must-see . Fo sho , yo !",1
"My guess would be this wa originally going to be at least two part , and thus at least a quarter longer , because otherwise how can one explain it confused , abbreviated storyline . I wa never completely lost , but I wa often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation . The movie feel a though joining plot point were dropped to squeeze it into it time slot . If it were longer , it might make more sense , but it still would n't be much good . The movie 's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera a being a war between the male and female , but the movie drop the ball on this , making Hera 's follower fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus ' follower do or believe . The movie is also interesting because you do n't see the god and there 's no real certainty that they exist . So it 's got a couple of intriguing idea , but it doe n't do anything useful with them . Bad dialog , cardboard character , and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic son . Not unwatchable but also not worth watching .",0
"Well , I like to watch bad horror B-Movies , cause I think it 's interesting to see stupidity and unability of creator to shoot seriously good movie . ( I always compare this movie to - for example - some Spielberg 's work and again-and-again do n't understand the huge difference in what I see . ) I like Ed Wood 's movie cause it 's so inept it 's very funny . But people ! ! ! `` The Chilling '' is not funny and is not even `` interesting '' . It 's EXTREMELY BORING horror movie without ANYTHING what make even bad movie watchable . There 's no acting , no screenplay , no direction , no thrill and not even blood . It 's extremely inept amateurish film . It 's definitely the WORST movie I had ever seen ( and I had seen a lot of `` worst movie '' - believe me ) . I warned you ! ! ! 1/10",0
"This IS the worst movie I have ever seen , a well a , the worst that I will probably EVER see . I see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously , just be forewarned ... This IS NOT one of those bad movie you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it , it just plain BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD . This movie is the equivalent to having a `` pet rock '' a your friend . You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen . Unfortunately , it never doe . At least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into . Lion 's Gate completely deceives on this bombshell ... No ... this is a disaster . After watching this film , you would swear George W. Bush had his hand all over the making of this film ... yes it that idiotic . Stay away , unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time . Its probably how Lion 's Gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe .",0
"I have been a Mario fan for a long a I can remember , I have very fond memory of playing Super Mario World a a kid , this game ha brought back many of those memory while adding something new . Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise . There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it , while still keeping intact the greatest element of Mario , the first noticeable difference is that the story take place in space . The story begin much like any other Mario game , Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom . Upon arriving at Peach 's castle Mario find Bowser and his son ( Bowser Jr. ) attacking the castle with their airship . Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lift her castle up into space . In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario fall off and land on an unknown planet . Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Luma 's home , a floating space station , here Mario meet many other Lumas and also meet their leader , a woman named Rosalina . Rosalina tell Mario that Bowser ha taken away the space station 's Power Stars and scattered them across the universe , it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach , thus the adventure begin . The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxy , each galaxy consists of multiple planet that Mario travel amongst in level via these shooting star to retrieve the Power Stars . Mario can at many time walk all the way around planet without losing gravity , some planet are small and others are big , many planet are similar to classic Mario environment . The best thing about the game are the control , all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same , but the wiimote is used in many unique way in this game . You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used a the primary attack in the game , and it will a well activate the shooting star . You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bit at enemy or object in the environment . Then there is the graphic , these are by far the best graphic on the Wii , it is just so hard to describe how great this game look , you could probably almost say it look a good a some 360 game . My only minor gripe is that the going upside down effect take some getting used to , and also the story is pretty weak . The worst part is that you lose all of your life when you turn off the game , no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 life . Still these minor problem aside it 's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging . This is the type of game that we 've been waiting for on the Wii . A perfect 10 out of 10 !",1
"This short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoon yielding multiple writer . The short film star Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job , join in the fight against the evil spoon . This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning , but is barely present for the remainder of the feature . This film 's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number . Unfortunately not much else lie below it . The plot that is set up doe n't really have time to show . But it 's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood film . This film is worth watching at least a few time . Take it for what it is , and do n't expect a deep story .",1
"Okay , last night , August 18th , 2004 , I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a showing of the film The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago a part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival . Here 's what I have to say about it . First of all , the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger , Roman Polanski , Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I 've ever seen . Second of all , in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family member or Charlie himself , calling them liar and saying he wanted nothing to do with them , that the film wa based on his ( Van Bebble 's ) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news ( and I 'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative ) . So I had second dibs on question , I asked if he wa trying to present the outsider , Mtv , sex drug and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story . This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting `` f * * * you , shut the f * * * up , this is the truth ! All those other movie are bullsh * * ! '' Well anyway , I did n't even think about how ridiculous this wa until the next day when I read the tagline for the film , `` You 've heard the law side of the story ... now hear the story a it is told by the Manson Family . '' Excuse me , if this guy ha never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liar that he doe n't want to have anything to do with , how in God 's name can he tell the story for them ! ? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard ! The film wa obviously catered to the sex drug and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small , dimly lit theatre , and wa even more obviously spawned by the sex drug and rock 'n roll mind of a man who could n't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minute to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actor on screen . This film accomplishes little more than warping the public 's image of actual event ( which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today ) into some sort of Slasher/Comic Book/Porno/Rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual . The film wa definitely very impressive to look at . The soundtrack wa refreshing a it contained actual sample of Charlie 's work with the Family off of his Lie album . The editing wa nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music video . All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogue at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the mind of any intellectual observer . I felt like I wa at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience wa dressed and behaving ( probably the best part of the experience ) . The cast wa very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he wa portraying . The description the film gave of him a full of energy , throwing ten thing at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow , lethargic , and chubby representation that wa actually presented . All in all the film basically explains itself a Sadie ( or maybe it wa Linda ) declares at the end , `` You can write a bunch of bullsh * * book or make a bunch of bullsh * * movie ... etc . etc . '' Case in point . Even the disclaimer `` Based on a True Story '' is a dead giveaway , signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and ha made a difference in the world . All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap , or actually , maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead . All I can say is this , when the film ended I got a free beer so I 'm glad I went , but not so glad I spent fifteen dollar on my ticket to be told to shut the f * * * up for asking the director a question . Peace .",0
"I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart . I am glad I did . It wa very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game . I thought the graphic were the best I have ever seen in a movie/game remake . The bonus level were very hard ! The sniper one I think wa too hard , it made me so frustrated I did n't play the game for a week and a half . There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it . The only thing I might change wa the upgrade system . I did n't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded , such a buying an armor upgrade did n't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter . I really liked the Q copter . I think the developer did a good job .",1
"No , this hilariously horrible 70 's made-for-TV horror clinker is n't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake . Still , this exceptionally awful , yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reach a breathtaking apex of absolute , unremitting silliness and atrociousness that 's quite tasty in a so-execrable-it's-downright-awesome sort of way . Richard Crenna , looking haggard and possibly inebriated , and Yvette Mimieux , who act a if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in `` Jackson County Jail , '' sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint , dull , sleepy small town existence get ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in a the family pet turn out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit . Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kid Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann ( the psychic alien moppet from the Disney `` Witch Mountain '' picture ) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty , ugly canine entity in the den . Boy , now doe n't that sound really scary and disturbing ? Well , scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ai n't , but it sure is funny , thanks to Curtis ( `` Night Tide '' ) Harrington 's hopelessly weak direction , cartoonish ( not so ) special effect , an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot , and a game cast that struggle valiantly with the absurd story ( besides the lead , both Martine Beswicke and R.G . Armstrong briefly pop up a member of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory ha a nice cameo a a helpful Native American shaman ) . Favorite scene : the malicious Mephestophelion mutt put the whammy on Crenna , practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade . While stuck-up snobby fright film fan may hold their nose at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock , devout TV trash lover should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to Alpo .",1
"It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen , and who will die . It is about 4 woman and a man who on a vacation . This wa made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventy , when blonde woman were supposedly ultra American survivor and brunette were all deserving of death . This movie , like the others of that era , contrives to bring this about , and the viewer know this . There is no mystery or suspense . The people squabble , but everything is so predictable for the prejudice of the time , it is laughable . The five people happen upon two savage young character , and go nut . Everyone is nut , so that the director-writer team can justify their Nazi propaganda . For some reason , the guy is attracted to the blonde , who is really not much to look at , and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nut over . One must remember that in the seventy , movie were meant to appeal to woman and not men . Totally crap and totally depressing .",0
"Marion Davies star in this remarkable comedy `` Show People '' released by MGM in 1928 . Davies play a hick from Savannah , Georgia , who arrives in Hollywood with her father ( Dell Henderson ) . The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - a is Davies outrageous southern costume . Davies land a job in slapstick comedy , not what she want , but it brings her success . She meet fellow slapstick star William Haines , who is immediately smitten with her . Well , Davies then get a job at a more prestigious studio ( `` High Art Studios '' ) and land a job in stuffy period piece . A handsome but fake actor ( Andre Telefair ) show her the rope of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star . Davies abandon her slapstick friend and father for the good life , but of course learns that is not who she really is . Marion Davies is wonderful throughout , a she - outrageously - run the gamut of emotion required of a `` serious '' actress . William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self , and there are cameo by Charles Chaplin , John Gilbert , and other famous star of the day , including the director of the film , King Vidor . This is a silent film with a few `` sound effect '' a sound picture were just coming into their own . A treasure of a film .",1
"The performance of every actor and actress ( in the film ) are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be ; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every detail that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again . However , I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actor ' and director , Attenborough 's credit that puzzle me : are n't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent , long lasting film for the audience ? I am hoping I would get some answer to my puzzle from some one ( possibly one of the `` knowledgeable '' personnel ( insider ) of the film .",1
"While Star Trek the Motion Picture wa mostly boring , Star Trek The Final Frontier is plain bad . In this terrible sequel , the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassador representing Earth , Romulus and Kronos ( the Klingon home world ) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier . There , he hope to find God . Using mysticism and bad writing , he persuades many of the senior officer of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship . They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien . This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin . At the core is a good idea that is never really developed . The plot go nowhere instead of where no man ha gone before . It is almost like the writer had no idea how to end this fiasco . The action scene do n't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn , the philosophy is boring , and the humor is stale . Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner . When he take the director 's chair , the ego get bigger . Most of the focus is on him , Spock , and McCoy , but doe not give the others enough to do . Moreover , whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movie and television spot , he is just plain bad in this one . Now Kirk is reckless , a practical joker , and silly . One of the worst scene involves the three leader singing the song , `` Row Row Row your Boat '' in a round by a campfire . In any case , this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise . I should have given it three out of ten instead of five .",0
"Despite later claim , this early-talkie melodrama ha very little in common with `` Citizen Kane '' : It 's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat , told in flashback but hopping around time . The scriptwriter , Preston Sturges , show none of his later gift for sparkling dialog , and none of the myriad cinematic innovation of `` Kane '' are evident . Still , it 's very watchable , with a young Spencer Tracy ( his old-man makeup make him look just like , well , an old Spencer Tracy ) showing depth and authority , and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime , and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man . There 's also Helen Vinson a one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history , sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberation . The surviving print is jumpy and ha missing audio snippet , and there are some plot hole left open ( how would she know whose son it wa if she 's sleeping with both of them ? ) , and the music is awfully hokey . For all that , I wa quite fascinated .",1
"This is the best version ( so far ) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work . Dalton is a little tough to imagine a Rochester who Jane Eyre declared `` not handsome '' . But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark , pretty a she is , is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre . This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it . Nearly direct quote from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance ' in literature , this is the way to see it . I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original . The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this .",1
"Apparently , the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called `` movie . '' They described `` blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence . '' I saw no `` intrigue . '' I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie . I saw no `` violence . '' At least , I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief a to what could possibly hurt a man with `` impervious '' skin -- but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the `` plot . '' Furthermore , a a viewer of many and sundry film ( some of which include the occasional kung fu movie ) , I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable . Whatever you may choose to do , I will always remain Correct , Jonathan Tanner P.S . I wa not blinded by the choreography .",0
"I liked Boyle 's performance , but that 's about the only positive thing I can say . Everything wa overdone to the point of absurdity . Most of the actor spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded , stone-hearted cop , or an ultra-evil villain . The raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me . I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music . And what 's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff ? It wa totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual event of the story . Cox added a lot of thing , in fact , that he apparently thought would be really cool , but had nothing to do with the story . That 's a big disappointment because one of the thing that make Borges ' story so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound , with no superfluous detail . This movie is just the opposite . I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from the Yidische Zaitung , or thereabouts . I wasted $ 4 renting this , but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake .",0
It 's terrific when a funny movie doe n't make smile you . What a pity ! ! This film is very boring and so long . It 's simply painfull . The story is staggering without goal and no fun . You feel better when it 's finished .,0
"So well made , no CGI crap . Has anyone else been on the `` Jumping Crocs '' tour of Darwin 's Adelaide River before ? Black Water wa WAY realistic ; Rogue wa a bit cringeworthy . Thought the blonde chick wa excellent in it - have n't really seen her before . And the other chick is a babe , she is always excellent . V. suspenseful - I would compare it to Jaws over any other man eating animal flick . Got the hole Aussie thing down pat without going OTT with struths and crikeys , a well . Loved it !",1
"The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twist driven by character , rather than star turn , the need to stage special effect , obligatory romance , and endless car chase . However , there is a car chase in here , and a dandy it is . Aidan Quinn is wonderful a both the terrorist and the naval officer `` recruited '' to eliminate him . It is rare that a second or third tier actor , such a Quinn , is given an important starring role like this that carry a film . Usually , such a role is given to an A-list actor with box office draw , which is probably why I never heard of this film before I saw it . Donald Sutherland is great a the morally ambiguous , somewhat creepy at time , agent that recruit Quinn . Ben Kingsley is fine also a the Israeli agent . The plot is very complex and there are multiple story line , which converge in gradual fashion toward the end , and not all at once a we 're used to seeing . The paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thriller is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity . The location are convincing and effective . The soundtrack is nothing special , but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned quality these day , without dumb and/or meaningless plot development ; unconvincing star turn ; loud , annoying , music video type soundtrack ; a villain that ham it up ; and repeatedly a cast , costume , and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25 . This is an outstanding thriller , which most assuredly did not get it just due upon it release . * * * 1/2 of 4 star .",1
this is one of the finest movie i have ever seen .... the stark scenery ... the isolation ... the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion ... a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication ... the acting is completely natural ... but for me a a '' foodie ' the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast .. i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well ... whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i do n't know but i do know of similar establishment and babette 's menu and choice of wine are authentic ... and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be .. this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it,1
"Set in the 1794 , the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI , this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leader Danton ( Gerard Depardieu , at his finest ) and Robespierre ( a commanding performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak ) . The moderate revolutionary Danton ha returned to Paris from his country seat where he ha been since being deposed a leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre . He is opposed to `` The Reign Of Terror '' which ha resulted in the execution of thousand of citizen , mainly by guillotine , who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution . Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and try to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting . But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown , and put Danton and his supporter on trial for being traitor . This wa the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland . His Polish film company wa closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union , which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventy and early eighty . His previous film `` Man Of Iron '' ( 1981 ) had dealt with the Solidarity union and it leader Lech Walesa , and it is easy to draw comparison between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski , and that between Danton and Robespierre . Danton/Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre/Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent . The film is based on the Polish play `` The Danton Affair '' written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s , and on it release the film wa criticised by some for being static and theatrical . But what the film doe is to concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meeting of the Committees and the scene in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activity on the street of Paris .",1
"Usually I 'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighty & early ninety film featuring now ha beens ... but this film is so incredibly terrible that it wa a real endurance test to sit through . Guys dressing up a girl ha been done to death - but never so pathetically . Corey Haim 's performance wa abysmal a usual , Nicole Eggert wa not much better . This ha no redeeming quality , even if you are a number # 1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away !",0
"I have now seen quite a few film by Pedro Almodóvar , but this would have to be the most disappointing so far . This film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his film , and the story just never got me interested . Many Almodóvar regular appear in this film , so it 's not like there wa a lack of on-screen talent , but this film just seemed more serious than his other film . If there wa a comedic edge to this movie , I certainly could n't find it , and it made for one surprisingly weak movie .",0
"I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood 's novel 'The Robber Bride ' , and I wa thrilled to see there wa a movie version . A woman frame a cop boyfriend for her own murder , and his buddy , an ex-cop journalist , try to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman 's crazy female friend . It 's fortunate that the movie script fix Ms. Atwood 's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men , victim of scheming woman ... Heh . Okay , you got me . If these guy are mentioned in the book , and I 'm pretty sure they 're entirely made up for the movie , I 'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy . Apparently , the three main female character of the novel are n't enough to carry the movie . Zenia 's manipulation are n't interesting unless we see them happen to a man , and a man 's life is screwed up . Roz , Charis , and Toni tell their story -- to a man . Because it 's not important if a man doe n't hear them . I liked the character in the book . It hurt to see them pushed off to the side for a man 's story . I normally do not look for feminist angle on medium , and I tried to enjoy the movie a is . If I had n't read the book , I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more . So if you like the cop and the ex-cop , and you want to read more about them , you 're out of luck . Read the novel , if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot . It 's the same plot : the movie excavated it , ironed it , and sprinkled it with male angst . It 's like Zenia 's revenge on Margaret Atwood .",0
this movie get a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who care about the plot or the acting.this is an Italian horror movie people so you know you ca n't expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody know fulci took footage from other movie and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movie that he took footage from it did n't matter to me.the Italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest Italian movie you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehound dream come true .,1
"Ingrid Bergman , playing dentist Walter Matthau 's faithful receptionist who harbor a little crush on her bos , is absolutely wonderful in this film . She handle the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steal a terrific scene where she and Goldie Hawn talk in a record booth ( Ingrid 's monologue is a front , but her face tell you she belief in it with all her heart ) . Matthau is an odd choice for the leading man ( he 's too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman , not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist ) , but I liked the way he try hard to please Goldie and stumble around trying to free himself from a lie . Hawn ( who won a Supporting Oscar ) is just a fresh and bubbly a she is today . This bedroom farce is n't terribly sophisticated ( and faintly reminds one of `` Any Wednesday '' besides ) , but it 's a welcome relief from the noisy , teen-oriented comedy they turn out today . `` Cactus Flower '' is a lovely sigh ! * * * from * * * *",1

"Ah yes the 1980s , a time of Reaganomics and Sly , Chuck and a host of other action star hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commie . At the time I couldn ` t believe how movie like RAMBO , MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR ( And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN ? ) made money at the box office , they ` re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . TROMA ` S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movie but you ` ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? Of course not . TROMA ` S WAR lack any sort of sophistication - though it doe make the point that there ` s no real difference between right wing tyrant and left wing one - and sometimes feel more like a grade z movie than a send up . Maybe it is ?",0
"This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe piece ( `` The Fall of the House of Usher '' , `` Dance of Death '' ( poem ) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end . It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movie about people that meet in an old decrepit house ( for example , `` The Cat and the Canary '' , `` The Old Dark House '' , `` Night of Terror '' and so on ) . Boris Karloff play a demented inventor of life-size doll that terrorize the guest . He dy early in the film ( or doe he ? ) and the resident of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experience . I wo n't go into too much detail here , but it is definitely a must-see for fan of old dark house mystery . Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room . Dan Basinger 8/10",1

"`` Revolt of the Zombies '' prof that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doe n't necessarily make lightning strike twice . The Halperin brother , responsible for the horror classic `` White Zombie '' , made this trite piece of garbage a mere few year later to cash in on it popularity and even recycled close-ups of Lugosi 's eye from that previous film . There wa a court battle with the `` White Zombie '' film 's right owner , who did n't want the Halperins to be able to use the word 'zombie ' in this title . That word wa the only thing that could help this film , because , a everyone know , bad film can make much more money simply by having the word 'Zombie ' appear in the title . Knowing what Victor Halperin wa capable of a few year before only make this uninteresting film more insulting . It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle . The zombie here seem not to be true walking dead , but simply hypnotism victim . Wan na create a mind-controlled army of zombie ? Be ready to crack a few egg , including your own . THE LAME PLOT : Man fall in love with scheming woman who play with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend , whom she love , jealous . This sends man into a spiral of madness in which he try using zombie mind-control technique to change thing to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who is n't worth spit . This includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot development I 've ever seen . You 'd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming . The acting is n't even good . This movie make the racially insensitive `` King of the Zombies '' ( which appeared on the same double bill DVD I bought ) seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds u that not every black and white film is a classic . It make the atomic age sci-fi alien zombie cheese fest `` Invisible Invaders '' seem like a serious drama . This is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a Korean film fan twitch ( South Korean film are often known for their use of melodrama ) . The credit list the ironically named company Favorite Films . I 'm not sure whose favorite film this would be , but they 're obviously an idiot . Not recommended for fan of : zombie , romance , or classic film .",0
"The complaint are valid , to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for woman . I am okay with these night time soap , like Grey 's Anatomy , or Ugly Betty , or West Wing , because there are story that are interesting even with the given that they will never end . However , when the idea parallel the daytime soap aimed at just putting hunky men ( Taye Diggs , Tim Daly , and Chris Lowell ) into sexual tension and romp , and numerous ridiculous difficult situation in a so-called little hospital , it seems like General Hospital ... or a female counterpart to Baywatch . That wa what men wanted and they had it , so if this is what woman want so be it , but the idea that this is a high brow show ( or something men will watch ) is unrealistic .",0
"This movie wa one of the best movie that I have seen this year . I did n't see any cameo in the movie , but it is still pretty good . It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department , but I think this is a better put together movie . It actually ha a point . If you are going to see a whole bunch of T & A you will be disappointed . Just a well put together movie ! ! ! ! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor , you will find this to be a really good movie . I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper 's review of this movie is right on . I mean , I do n't really like Ebert on most movie , but this is the movie that I will agree about . The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there . There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie . Yea , sure , you get laughed at when it is found out about , but it still suggests that you wait . Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet , it is still funny .",1
"I remember seeing this film in the mid 80 's thought it a well paced and well acted piece . I now work quite often in Berkeley Square and the had to get a copy of DVD to remind myself how little the area ha changed , although my office is newish it just 30 second away from `` the bank '' . Even Jack Barclays car dealership is still there selling Bentleys and Rolls Royces . It 's look like the DVD is due a Region 2 release soon . The region 1 copy I is very poor quality . Let 's hope they 've cleaned it up . Only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoil what would otherwise be a great film but I guess is in line with the caper tag the film go with .",1
"Two hour ago I wa watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with it imprisoning photography . It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes 2000 . Close ups predominated it . Close ups of wall , human and of many other thing . The warm colored lighting ( which is also usually by the director ) gave the movie a warm atmosphere . Only two person are principally to be seen in most of it . An interesting music and especially three song or theme accompanied the movie nearly all the time . Each one of these theme represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie . Silence and slow movement characterize the movie . Some scene were extended moment or a serious of close-ups . Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since Maggie Cheung wa also so brilliant . I wonder how many dress she wa wearing in the different scene . The story wa also connected somehow with the history of Hong Kong and the region the 1960s . This prevented me from understanding some detail of the it especially at the end . In short I would recommend the fan of artistic movie to watch it in the cinema .",1
"Luckily for Bill Murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much ha to carry it . Meatballs is the story of low-rent Camp Northstar and how it counselor deal with the camper a well a one another . Then there is much made of their wealthy rival from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a two-day Olympiad competition . Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut . The film is sprinkled with medium-sized laugh , chuckle , and more than a few guffaw along the way . The biggest laugh come from the prank played on the nerdy camp director . Three of them involve the counselor moving his bed outside in various location while he 's sleeping . Morty , or `` Micky '' a everyone call him , wake up along the side of a road , strung up in some tree several foot above the ground , and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake ! There are also some funny moment involving the counselor hitting on one another , but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchiness . The film take a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace . Of course it 's up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up , and give him the confidence he need to run a marathon during the Olympiad . The sentimentality of Rudy 's situation seems tacked on to a great degree . Notice how when Murray first see the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tell him , `` you must be the short depressed kid we ordered . '' Makes you wonder if that line wa really in the script or Murray wa just ad-libbing while the camera were rolling . In other word , Murray might a well have said to Makepeace , `` you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp film who doe n't fit in . '' But before it 's all over , Murray 's performance make this plot device more than bearable . He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace . The film culminates with the game between the two rival camp . Very little of the event we are shown are even slightly believable , but `` it just doe n't matter '' . This is a pretty good film on many level . Do n't let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off . Murray will keep you laughing throughout . Just be warned ..... avoid the sequel ! ! ! ! Especially the one with Corey Feldman ! ! 8 of 10 star . The Hound .",1

When I 'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen , I usually pause the vcr , so I wo n't miss anything . Not this time . I actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge , just so I would n't have to go back . Why the hell is there not ONE sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who ha the vaguest clue about how computer work ? It 's mindboggling .

"Anyone who think Kool Moe Dee , Carol Alt , and Corey Feldman comprise a list of good actor must be smoking something I 'd love to try sometime . Where to begin : lousy soundtrack , hammy acting , `` action '' in place . This is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed-up has-been and never-was 's love to star in . I actually felt embarrassed for the `` star '' in this `` film '' . The only thespian missing to top this turd wa Gary Coleman , who if he would have been in the movie , would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad , rather than just plain bad . There wa one part in the film where Carol Alt screamed , `` DO YOU THINK I 'M AN IDIOT ? ! ? '' Yes , Carol , I do , your agent doe , and PLEASE for the love of all that is decent and holy ... GO AWAY and stop degrading yourself like this ! This film is something Anna Nicole Smith would take part in . I would tell you what the plot wa , but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article , plus my mind drifted many time during the movie anyway , so I barely paid attention .",0
"This film could have been a decent re-make , and gosh know it tried ( or Ms. English tried ) . Assembling talented actor together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film . But Ms. English 's experience - according to her IMDb bio - is exclusively limited to television work , and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film . I am surprised that none of the review I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film , and what kept it from reaching even a portion of it potential : it looked and felt like it wa made for television . To give some credit to Ms. English , many of the joke that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV ( and maybe a laugh track would have helped ) . So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen . If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com , I think it could have worked . But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English 's talent did n't translate . I cringed at so many different point in my embarrassment for the actor & the writer that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled ! Meg Ryan is her usual perky , cute self ( except for the awful plastic surgery she ha had on her face ) , but where did she have a chance to use her talent ? ! She ha made film where she doe n't recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well ... but not here . Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motion - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance ! I enjoyed the other woman character but they were more caricature than substance , and it wa sad to see . What worked in this film in the 1930s doe n't translate to the 2000s , and no one helped Ms. English get the change & update or subtlety right . If only she ( a writer , director AND producer ) had reached out for some assistance , I think it could have been good . But it wa not . It 's so frustrating to go to a movie that ha good star and a good writer or director and come away feeling it wa a waste of everyone 's time & money ! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate : A few movie exec are having a meeting & the caption read : `` Let 's remake a classic with worse everything ! ''",0
"I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill , Jackie Kennedy 's sister and the cousin of these woman , would encourage the Maysles ' to make `` Big Edie '' and `` Little Edie '' the subject of a film .

The extra feature on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designer crediting some of their idea to these oddball woman . I 'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designer fascinating . ( i.e . `` Are they nut ? Or am I missing something ? '' ) . This movie is hard to come by . Netflix doe not have it . Facets doe , though .",1
"C'mon guy some previous reviewer have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode . It 's just an old 60 's TV show ! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe ( Yeoman Barrow 's ) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it wa filmed in a real outdoor location . Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally confined to sound stage . This use of an outdoor location ( and babe ) give proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show . Except a few notable exception i.e `` The city on the edge of forever '' , `` assignment Earth '' and `` Tomorrow is Yesterday '' The old series of Star Trek need to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it 's boring misery . Half a dozen good episode from 79 is quite a poor batting average . This is typical of the boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced back then actually , contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on , he actually made a LOT of rubbish ! He doe n't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath a Irwin Allen for example . Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view . They used wobbly plywood for the floor , cafeteria chair with plastic back and cheap cardboard above the instrument panel . You can clearly see the fold in the paper ! Every expense spared or what !",0
"I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked ( not loved ) `` Mork & Mindy '' a a kid , mostly for Robin William 's zany energetic performance . This movie made me remember why . Was the original show great ? Not really , but Robin certainly wa . Which brings me to this movie . I wa pleasantly surprised , expecting nothing more than a paint by number chronological retelling of the show ( which in a way it wa ) . But , of course , the real focus wa on Robin . It wa interesting to see Robin 's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star , and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife . And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos a he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity , sensitivity , and heart ; not just a cute impression , although it wa even dead-on . ( On an unrelated note , I noticed that Robin 's struggle were in some way similar to Andy Kaufman , who wa under-appreciated by network t.v . and held back creatively , but that 's the `` Taxi '' behind the scene biopic . ) All in all , this wa a very enjoyable flick , in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan . The acting wa solid by all- never melodramatic like I suspected- and the story moved along well . Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi ( the scene in which Belushi heckle Robin wa a hoot ! ) . Not a great masterpiece by any mean ( I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber ) , but definitely watchable , especially for those Robin Williams and `` Mork & Mindy '' fan out there . Nanoo , nanoo !",1
"I caught this film on AZN on cable . It sounded like it would be a good film , a Japanese `` Green Card '' . I ca n't say I 've ever disliked an Asian film , quite the contrary . Some of the most incredible horror film of all time are Japanese and Korean , and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo 's Hong Kong film . I an not adverse to a light hearted film , like Tampopo or Chung King Express ( two of my favourite ) , so I thought I would like this . Well , I would rather slit my wrist and drink my own blood than watch this laborious , badly acted film ever again . I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude , because no one in this film had a personality . And when any of the character DID try to act , a opposed to mumbling a line or two , their performance came across a forced and incredibly fake . I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before ... the ONLY person who sounded genuine wa Brenda Aoki .. I find it amazing that this is promoted a a comedy , because I did n't laugh once . Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this `` a refreshing breath of comedy '' . It wa neither refreshing , nor a breath of comedy . And the ending wa very predictable , the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such thing . AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting . I actually think that `` Spike of Bensonhurst '' is a better acted film than this ... and I walked out half way through that film !",0
"Before I begin , let me get something off my chest : I 'm a huge fan of John Eyres ' first film PROJECT : SHADOWCHASER . The film , a B-grade cross of both THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD , may not be the work of a cinematic genius , but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit ( & spawned two sequel & a spin off ) . Judge and Jury begin with Joseph Meeker , a convicted killer who wa sent to Death Row following his capture after the so-called `` Bloody Shootout '' ( which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  Meeker kill three people while trying to rob a convenience store ) , being led to the electric chair . There is an amusing scene where Meeker talk to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love ( who wa killed during the shootout ) , expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  Michael Silvano , a washed-up football star who spends his day watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team ( and end up harassing his son 's coach ) . But once executed , Meeker return a a revenant ( or a Kelly Perine call `` a hamburger without the fry '' ) , whose sole aim is to get his revenge , which basically mean making Silvano 's life a misery . Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film . It is a supernatural action film , with Meeker chasing Silvano , using his ability to change form ( which amount to David Keith dressing up a everything from an Elvis impersonator , a French chef ( with an accent a bad a his moustache ) , a drag queen , a clown & a stand-up comedian ) , a shotgun which fire explosive round & an invulnerability to death ( although that doe n't stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle ) , to pay Silvano back for killing Meeker 's wife . Director John Eyres doe not seem interested in characterisation , instead focusing solely on action scene , which the film ha plenty of . But that is the film 's main flaw , since there 's nothing to connect the action scene together . The acting is surprisingly good , with Keith delivering the best performance , supported ably by Kove , a well a Paul Koslo , who play the washed-up cop quite well . Kelly Perine is annoying a the cabbie who try to help but make the situation worse .",0
"Ye Lou 's film Purple Butterfly pit a secret organization ( Purple Butterfly ) against the Japanese force in war torn Shanghai . Ding Hui ( Zhang Ziyi ) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami ( Toru Nakamura ) find themselves on opposite side of the conflict after a chance meeting . I agree with the reviewer from Paris . The film substitute a convoluted , semi-historical conflict for a plot , without giving the audience a single reason to care about the character or their cause . The sudden time shifting doe n't help matter a it appears completely unwarranted and pointless . Normally I do n't mind dark movie , but the absence of light , the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage , and the generally bad film-making technique really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in . I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film `` ha a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography '' , but I do n't think that help the movie . The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent event of the 20th Century , and I do n't believe you can do it any justice by editing it a if it were a Michael Bay film . The overly melodramatic moment do n't add to it watchability . The actor are all suitably melancholy . Zhang Ziyi once again show that she ha an exceptionally limited acting range a she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her film , brooding and looking generally annoyed . However , at least she add some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator . All in all , a very disappointing film , especially seeing a how it come from the director of Suzhou He . 2/10",0
"After hearing about George Orwell 's prophetic masterpiece for all of my life , I 'm now 37 , but never having read the book , I am totally confused a to what I 've just seen . I am very familiar with the concept covered in the novel , a i 'm sure most are , but only through hearsay and quote . Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery , and even with it I 'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I wa before I watched it . On the plus side ... The cinematography is amazing , Hurt & Burton deliver fine performance and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate . The prostitute scene wa a fantastically dark piece of film making . Now for the down side , and there are plenty ... There is a war going on , ( at least a far a the propaganda is concerned ) , but why & with who ? Nothing is explained . There are a couple of name bandied about ( Eurasia etc ) , but they mean nothing without explanation . Who is Winston ? what doe he do ? where doe he come from ? where doe he work ? why is he changing news report ? why is n't he on the front line ? Why doe n't he eat the food in the canteen ? What is that drink he 's drinking through the entire film ? Why is he so weak & ill ? Why is n't he brainwashed like the rest of them ? What 's the deal with his mother & sister ? What happened to his father ? A little back story would have been nice , no scrub that , essential for those like myself that have n't read the book . Without it , this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keep you guessing at what is actually going on . The soundtrack wa dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screen swamp the dialogue in place making it even harder to work out whats going on . I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it 's very annoying all the same . Also , I know this ha been mentioned before , but why all the nudity ? It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage . I personally ca n't abide the way Hollywood feel it ha to explain story line word for word these day . We are not all brainwashed simpleton , but this is a few step too far the other way . I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you 've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation ' that I 've seen many people say , I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed a the classic it is . There 's no denying that it wa light year ahead of it 's time and ha pretty much predicted every change in our society to date , ( maybe this ha been a sort of bible to the power that be ? ) , but many sci-fi novelist have done the same without leaving gaping hole in the storyline . I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i 'm to make any sense out of this . All in all , very disappointed in something I 've waited for year to watch .",0

"I just got back from this free screening , and this `` Osama Witch Project '' is the hands-down worst film I 've seen this year , worse than even `` Catwoman '' - which had the decency to at least pas itself off a fiction . In `` September Tapes , '' a `` film crew '' of `` documentary journalist '' head to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip , the condition and , oh yeah , the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife 's death on Sept. 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden . They `` made '' eight tape on their journey , which now `` document '' their travel and , of course , their attempt to kill the terrorist leader . ( The eight tape , thankfully , all end at point significant in the narrative , which is convenient for a `` documentary . '' ) The psychotic , idiotic protagonist - who is given to long , significant speech that he probably learned watching `` MacGyver '' - care nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew a he get them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishap . I do n't know why he did n't just wear a sign on his back that said `` Shoot me . '' The crew 's translator , supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason , doe little more than whine and get baffled a the idiot hero lead them into doom . You wish they 'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all moron . Around `` Tape 4 , '' I began rooting for the terrorist to shoot the film crew .",0
"I remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when I wa 6 years-old ( you do the math ) . I absolutely loved it . I wa Tarzan for the 2 week after seeing it ( climbing the furniture , jumping around making monkey sound ) . It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkey , but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert ( keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this ) . 1984 wa the last time I saw that film , until about a month ago . It happened to be on cable a I wa getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it wa late and I wa tired and I had to be at work at 9:00 am , I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved a a kid . Upon viewing it I realized that it wa not that great of a film and even odder then that , that Andie MacDowell 's voice wa dubbed by someone else . Ian Holme wa of course solid a usual , and surprisingly the monkey suit still kind of held up , but what wa most surprising wa how good Lambert wa a Tarzan . He wa great ! The depth he managed to capture in so few line , his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through it extremely large ark , were just amazing . As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan , but I 'm used to Highlander , The Hunted and Fortress . In this film he wa really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again . So to make a short story way too long , I wa a little disappointed that the film wa not that good , but I wa glad to see that Lambert wa good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it .",1
"A family is traveling through the mid West . There 's widower Ben ( Charles Bateman ) , his girlfriend Nicky ( Ahna Capri ) and Ben 's little daughter K.T . ( Geri Reischl ) . Then hit a town named Hillsboro where everyone act more than a little strangely . Their car break down and they 're forced to stay . They soon find out a witch coven ha a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil . The story is not that good . People just figure thing out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witch are at the end . Also there are a lot of loophole left dangling at the end . The acting is pretty poor too . Bateman and Capri are bland and everybody else is about the same . Only old pro Strother Martin and L.Q . Jones give good performance . Still this movie doe work . It forgoes blood and gore ( there 's some but this is PG ) and mange to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere . The acting hamper a lot of it but it still work . Martin especially chew the scenery in his role . I ca n't explain exactly why I ( sort of ) like this movie but it did work on me . It 's a quiet kind of horror that is n't made anymore . Hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered . A 7 .",1
"Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman 's flight from her husband -- and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger year are behind her . We learn little about this woman 's marriage except that she ha been feeling her independence slipping away a of late ; she 's also recently learned she 's pregnant , which ha further complicated her heart ( she doe n't want to be a complacent wifey , despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone ) . She meet two men on her journey : a former college football hero who -- after an accident during a game -- ha been left with permanent brain damage , and a sexy , strutting motorcycle cop who ha a great deal of trouble in his own life . The clear , clean landscape ( a photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler ) are astutely realized , a are the character . Shirley Knight , James Caan , and Robert Duvall each deliver strong , gripping performance , most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional term . Some scene ( such a Knight 's first call home from a pay-phone , or her first night alone with Caan where they play 'Simon Says ' ) are almost too intimate to watch . Coppola toy with reality , turning the jagged memory of his character into scrapbook we 've been made privy to . He allows scene to play out , yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy ( there are at least two or three very frisky moment ) . It 's a heady endeavor -- so much so that the picture wa still being shown at festival nearly five year later . Some may shun Coppola 's unapologetic twisting of event in order to underline the finale with bitter irony , however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate it shortcoming . * * * from * * * *",1
This movie wa not very well directed . they almost totally disregarded the book.I guess they were trying 2 save time . the only upside 2 me wa that the actor who played finny wa cute . Some of the dialog between the main character appeared a little gay which wa not the case in the book . Major part of the book were once again chopped out.You lost the over all effect it wa not a haunting a the book and left me lacking severely . Also the strong language although it wa brief wa very unnecessary . Also i wa surprised ( not pleasantly ) by a new character that wa no where in the book.One of my favorite character ( leper ) wa poorly interpreted and portrayed . He seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper wa in the book . Over all disappointing .,0
"The buzz for this film ha always been about the fabulous graphic that make Kevin Bacon disappear . Sadly , they stopped there . They should have continued to make the script disappear , then the silly set , and finally every visible element of this film . Because , there 's nothing else there to show . Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed a the writing credit for this film . I do n't really think they exist . I think they bought this script at `` Scripts-R-Us '' , where you buy a standard blank `` Monster Movie '' script and just fill in the blank . There 's a monster stalking u . Let 's split up . ( They actually `` let 's split up '' in this movie ) . Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar . Not dead yet . Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire .

What is sad is that there were lot of possibility for this to be a fascinating movie . They psychological issue for the subject , the deterioration of the mind due to the process , treating an invisible subject , and many other idea were touched on for usually le than 2 second and would have been far more interesting . Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end , it would have been a much better movie . All in all , it stunk .

Suffice it to say that these character are so stupid they do n't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than ...",0
"A young girl becomes a war-time marine 's pen-pal , and when he visit at war 's end expecting someone a bit more `` available , '' comic complication ensue . All ultimately work out well , naturally , but not before everyone involved ha thoroughly chewed the scenery . Errol Flynn 's dead-on impression of Humphrey Bogart from `` Casablanca '' is a highlight , a are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image ( the `` jumping '' scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot ) . It is Tucker , though , who `` tuck '' the movie under his arm , lower his head and barrel over the goal line . He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty year later in `` F-Troop '' and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly play off to raise his own performance . Eleanor Parker doe a fine job a the woman being pursued , and little Patti Brady charm a Tucker 's actual pen-pal friend .

"This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful . Ashmit play the role of Richard Gere , Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane.They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian mass . Even then the movie ha got the full trace of Unfaithful , though it could n't catch up with the original . It wa a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lover , where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show . Emran did more role like this and wa even nicknamed the serial killer . In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors . Though the film bombed at the box office , the actor got the undue recognition . In future the director should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film . All said , this is not a family film , so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family .",0
"Robert Altman 's downbeat , new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton 's book `` McCabe '' wa overlooked at the time of it release but in the past year ha garnered a sterling critical following . Aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario , the character here do n't merit much interest , and the picture look ( intentionally ) brackish and unappealing . Bearded Warren Beatty play a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settle in struggling community on the outskirt of nowhere and help organize the first brothel ; once the profit start coming in , Beatty is naturally menaced by city tough who want part of the action . Altman creates a solemn , wintry atmosphere for the movie which give the audience a certain sense of time and place , but the action in this sorry little town is limited -- most of the story being made up of vignette -- and Altman 's pacing is deliberately slow . There 's hardly a statement being made ( just the opposite , in fact ) and the languid actor stare at each other without much on their mind . It 's a self-defeating picture , and yet , in an Altman-quirky way , it wear defeat proudly . * * from * * * *",0
"What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me , on second viewing , a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation . Spoiler of sort follows . Poor Cedric ; he apparently did n't know what hit him . Poor audience ; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch . These two guy just did n't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter . As much a Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other , the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu , an intellectual being , to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibility were more attuned to carnival festivity and romp on the beach . On a purely technical note , I loved the camera action in this film . Subtitles were totally unnecessary , even though my French is `` presque rien . '' I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more . This wa a polished , very professionally made motion picture . Though many scene seem superfluous , I rate it nine out of ten .",1

"From the film 's first shot - Keira Knightley a Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn , thus invoking all the clichés cinema ha developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I wa in for something to make me want to kill myself . Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book , but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he wa filming wa not in fact Jane Austen 's subtle , nuanced comedy of manner conducted through sparkling , delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms , but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights . Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason , in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain . Not to mention that Jane Austen , and in particular P & P , is not about passion , sexual tension or love . It 's about different strategy of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society . Which wa completely ignored , so that the Bennets ' house wa a rambunctious , chaotic place where everybody shout at once , run around , leaf their underwear on chair , and pig wander happily through the house ; the society ball become rowdy country dance one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy ; and everybody say exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety . The genius of Jane Austen lie in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody say what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety , and the tragic predicament of her character arise from misunderstanding and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap . So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plot - particularly in this film - to function wa completely erased . Subtlety in general wa nowhere int his film , sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performance . It wa so obviously trying to be a * serious * film . The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice , both Austen 's methodology and her appeal - wa almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama , and when it wa allowed in , wa handled so clumsily . Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which make serious point , yes , but those serious point and weightier theme are not just intertwined with the humour , they are embedded in it . You ca n't lose Jane Austen 's technique , leaving only the bare bone of the story , and expect the theme to remain . Not even when you replace her technique with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography . Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman , an adult , mature and sensible and clear-sighted . Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl , and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who think she is a tragic heroine . Elizabeth 's wit , her combative verbal exchange , her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody 's folly including her own , her strength and composure , and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what ? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance ? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs , she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging , either ; no , these were petulant hissy fit . And where the great strength of Austen 's Elizabeth ( at least in Austen 's eye ) wa her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundary of society and sustaining impeachable propriety , Knightley 's Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention . Furthermore , she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overall established her beyond doubt a spirited and strong-minded , and therefore nothing in the character a written or the performance had to sustain it . An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance . In which quest for blandness and weakness , she wa ably matched by Matthew Macfayden . Donald Sutherland a Mr Bennet seemed weak , ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationship that make Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic . His special bond with Lizzie , a the only two sensible people in a world of fool , wa completely lost , not least because both of them were fool in a world of fool , and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact . Mr Bingley wa no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly , but wa played a a complete retard for cheap laugh , and the woman who wa playing Jane wa so wildly inconsistent that she may a well not have tried to do anything with the character at all . The script veered wildly between verbatim chunk of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy . Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache .",0
"I 've always enjoyed film that depict life a it is . Life sometimes ha boring patch , no real plot , and not necessarily a happy ending . `` A River Runs Through It '' is the perfect name for this film ( and Norman Maclean 's novel ) . Life ebb and flow like a river , and it ha it 's rough spot , but it is a wonderful trip . Robert Redford brings a lot to the film . His narration ha a friendly feel that fit the picture perfectly . As a director , he is restrained and calm , and capture some incredibly beautiful scene . As for the acting , Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprising well a brother .

"The story is very trustworthy and powerful . The technical side of the movie is quite fine .. even the directing of it . The main problem is with the casting , that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression . Beside the small role of the father , Rafael ( played impressively by Asi Dayan ) , all other actor were unfortunately not in their best . The role of the elder Blind girl , played by Taly Sharon , wa fresh but without any intensity a the leading role . therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile . There were moment and episode that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie . But after all it 's a good point to begin from and to make big improvement in the future .",0

This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth . I should have spit it out when I had the chance . The premise is corny enough to be fun . For the first time in like a thousand year , Gargoyles have returned to Romania , and all of the priest who knew how to fight and kill these thing are long dead . It 's up to Michael Pare and some other secret agent to get to the bottom of thing before the Gargoyles run amok . Unfortunately , the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and le than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human lead . The best acting is done by the CG Gargoyles . In the end , this movie feel like a poor man 's Van Helsing . If you check your brain at the door , this might get you through a dreary Monday night . I gave it 3 out of 10 star .",0
"I ca n't believe it that wa the worst movie i have ever seen in my life . i laughed a couple of time . ( probably because of how stupid it wa ) If someone paid me to see that movie again i would n't . the plot wa so horrible , it made no sense , and the acting wa so bad that i could n't even tell if they were trying . that movie wa terrible rating : F",0
"This is one of a rarity of movie , where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka . To be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man , Mo Ogrodnik , and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film . The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something 's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breast . Mo and Wolfgang 's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actress , plastic peen holding passion . There 's also beetle banging . As Violet would have put it : `` This ( plastic peen ) go up your butt '' . The rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome . Alright . So if you are still reading , let u explain who we are . Mo Ogrodnik teach at NYU and we are a group of her student , who , finishing a film class with her , decided to get poop- faced and watch here directorial debut . She also wrote Uptown Girls . I ca n't tell you how much that 's been hammered into our skull . So this movie is quite the experience . At the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie . About 13 minute into this game , none of u could see straight . The sheer amount of Dido 's in the first thirty minute created enough reason to drink to pacify an elephant.There wa something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girl hit on a Kurt Cobain lookalike with absolutely no context , save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he wa oh-so-naturally reading a local newspaper . Because that 's what we all do . The heart-shaped glass were delightfully derivative of Lolita . And something about that provocative scene of the nude chin-up boy suggests the director 's history of homosexual pornographic experiment . We wish we were kidding . Enough intellectual contemplation . ON TO THE DRINKING GAME ! This will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one . It 's very simple , and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care . The Mo Ogrodnik/Ripe Drinking Game : 1 . Every time you see anything related to pornography , take a drink . 2 . Every time you see auteur Mo Ogrodnik 's name appear , take a drink . 3 . Sex . 4 . ( plastic peen ) require two drink . 5 . Any time somebody point a gun at another character , take a drink . -At this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body.- 6 . Any time there is blood ( INCLUDING `` LADY BLOOD '' ) , please take a sip ! 7 . The underused hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second . 8 . Gratuitous use of the `` magic black man '' requires one drink . 9 . If you ca n't figure out the through-line , KEEP DRINKING , Beyotch . 10 . Whenever you are able to predict a line , take a drink . Trust u . It 's easy . That 's it , internet ! Keep drinking , and try not to get riped . -Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch , Jr .",0
"Even though I 'm quite young , The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band ! I never had the chance to hear their music a it wa release but have loved them since I can remember . It 's the sort of film that is worth trying the once . I can see why it wa n't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the TV . I wa flicking through my TV guide and happened to see this film , it did n't much detail except something like , 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken up , Jared Harris Stars ' . I 'd never heard of him ( he played John ) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul . However they are certainly underestimated actor ! The film had a slow start but a it developed , I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their character . As a huge fan , I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like . The script wa brilliant and Harris got Lennon 's accent , personality and mannerism spot on ! Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into his Irish accent . THe make-up artist made them look excellent . THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE COUNTED AS A * SPOILER * : As I mentioned before , it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film . I found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musician . As for Lennon 's rude line in the Italian restaurant , totally unnecessary . The ending wa very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever I watch it . It is quite different from the other biographical film I 've seen where it 's about how The Beatles got together and became famous , and those never really did the character that well . E.g . 'Backbeat ' . In conclusion , I would say , if you 're a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan , give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise . At only about 95 minute long , it 's worth waiting for the film to develop . If anyone doe know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page ' for this film , I 'd be very interested .",1
"An American Werewolf in London had some funny part , but this one is n't so good . The computer werewolf are just awful : the perspective is all off , it 's like seeing them through a distorting mirror . The writer step on the throat of many of their gag . American boy say to Parisian girl , `` Is there a cafe ' around here ? '' Instead of just leaving it at that , they have to have the girl sigh and respond , `` This is Paris . ''",0
"Originally I wa a Tenacious D fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few track off The P.O.D . and wa rather disappointed . After watching the movie , my view wa changed . The movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it wa really wa a stupid storyline because of the attitude that KG and Jaybles portray in the movie . Much more entertaining and enjoyable than movie I have seen in the theater lately . ex . Saw III ( dull and dragging ) , Casino Royale ( way to homo-erotic ) which in prior installment I have really enjoyed If you enjoyed Borat , you will enjoy the tale of The Greatest Band on Earth",1
"This is just one more of those hideous film that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner . Along with other such nasty film a `` The Burning Bed , '' `` Enough , '' or `` Monster , '' this film take a disgusting criminal and attempt to show the viewer why she 's not such a bad person after all . Give u a break ! Here 's my question to the filmmaker : If LeTourneau were a man , and Vili were a 12 year old girl , would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person ? Answer : Hell no . Imagine switching the gender in this film , and then you 'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage . Were the gender switched , there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal . Instead , we 'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl , his lascivious behavior landing him in prison , and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome . The only reason LeTourneau doe not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex . Let 's call a spade a spade . LeTourneau is a pedophile . Plain and simple . No ifs , ands or buts . She 's a criminal who belongs in prison , and deserves our derision and contempt , but certainly not our pity or empathy .",0
"The premise of this movie wa decent enough , but with sub par acting , it wa just bland and dull . SPOILERS The film doe not work because of the nature of the death , it wa accidental , so although it wa a murder it wa n't like the guy set out to do it . Also through some flashback there is a secret that is revealed that sort of make the event like justice to a degree . There is no emotion in this film . The first 20 minute or so is just this woman calling her sister , and hearing her message . It wa dull and boring . With some polishing , and better acting it could have been pretty good .",0
"The Lives of the Saints start off with an atmospheric vision of London a a bustling city of busy , quaint street and sunshine . I wa hoping it would maintain this atmosphere , but it get bogged down in a story that go pretty much nowhere . Othello work for big , fat Mr. Karva , his crime-boss step-dad ( at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because it 's never really defined , but he doe drop kitten into deep fat frier , so trust me , he 's a prick ) doing scrappy little errand while his skanky girlfriend give daddy hand-jobs . One of his colleague is Runner , a black dude who is always dashing from A to B . Until the day he come across almost mute homeless child who grant him his wish of being able to stop running . Runner dump the lost boy in Othello 's flat , where he promptly start granting more wish . Keen to have some of his own desire fulfilled , Karva ha the boy kidnapped . But he is n't sure of what would really bring him happiness . Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job ? Either way , I do n't want to see the little boy grant him the second . It just take age to get going and there are load of repetitive scene . The ending try to be shocking but since there 's hardly any back-story on investment in any of these character it only serf a a release for the bored audience . Writer Tony Grisoni , a favourite of Terry Gilliam , try to blend in some kind of religious allegory which end up being pretentious a all hell , ironically . If he gave u something more accessible or at least had better explanation for the character suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film . As it is , we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouth who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy . Who 's origin are never revealed . That 's just plain irritating ! Aside from sporadic moment of atmosphere and a moody score , this film ha little to recommend .",0
"I ca n't emphasize it enough , do * NOT * get this movie for the kid . For that matter , you 'd best spare the adult from it a well . All right , perhaps I 'm overexaggerating a little . This is n't the worst kid ' movie ... no , let me rephrase that . This is n't the worst movie made by dissilusioned adult FOR dissilusioned adult and somehow marketed towards kid ( that would be `` Jack '' , which I 've been meaning to review / gut like a fish ) . Adults wo n't learn anything surprising ( well , if you must , fast-forward to just before the end credit for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon ) . We do n't usually end up doing a adult what we wanted to do a kid a reality tends to get in the way . Well , duh , I could have told you that ( so can four year of college at an art school , but I degress ) . I have no idea what the heck kid could possibly get out of this movie . Most likely it will only upset them ( we get to watch the moment when Russ wa traumatized at eight year old ) . There 's a better movie , `` Kiki 's Delivery Service '' , that ha essentially the same message but handle it litely instead of drilling it into your head . And the adult will like it too ! By the way , there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind , if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it .",0
"Is nothing else on TV ? Are you really bored ? Well , then watch Phat Beach . However , do n't rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it . That would be a big mistake . I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain point . I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard . However , there were subtle joke and comment I laughed at . If you are looking for an extremely funny `` hood '' movie then watch Friday . If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie ( something that this movie try at .. kind of ) watch something like hoop dream or Jason 's Lyric . If you are lookin for some good black `` booty '' go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick , because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent . However , if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable , go ahead and watch it . You will be slightly amused . * * * 3 out of 10 * * *",0
"The Elegant Documentary - Do n't watch this movie ... if you 're an egotistical know-all student of physic . This much le than one percent ( miniscule fraction ) of the population may find that this show just tell them what they have already learned and already know . Do watch this movie ! - If you 're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99 % of the population that doe not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theory of physic including Relativity , Quantum , String and M-theory . What a brilliantly architected documentary . Starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a Universe of pure magic - and dimension beyond . I have always had a huge appreciation of Mathematics . This movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you 're about to fail the grade . The show is repetitive at time a the original format wa a mini-series split over three show . It therefore make sense to give u polite little reminder of the principle being presented . I found this immensely helpful a it kept reminding me of the multitude of question and possible answer that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence . We are all ( and everything around u ) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony . This movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around u ( even with the Hubble Telescope ) and far far smaller than the proton and neutron within the atom we learned about in high-school . M-theory hold many magnificent magnitude of 'possibility ' . It just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it 's very nature move ( by admission by the many brilliant scientist presenting ) out of the realm of Science and into the realm of Philisophy . You do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to God . Bravo Brian Greene . Well done indeed . P.S . If you 're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the Universe and would like some more insight into the 'possibilities ' Quantum mechanic blended with Spirituality ( of all thing ) can bring then I highly recommend that you also watch `` What the Bleep ! ? - Down the Rabbit Hole '' . Yes I know they make a few silly mistake by suggesting a Shaman may not be able to see a boat if he ha n't seen one before ( my eye process light reflection just fine - I see thing everyday that I 've never seen before ) and brain cell are cell in the body that actually do n't divide . But if you can get over these little hurdle and put down the thing you do n't like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film . Then watch `` The Secret '' ( 2006 documentary about The Law of Attraction - search for IMDb title `` tt0846789 '' ) . This information just might change your life profoundly - forever . If you search deeper you might even find the Universe is talking to u with thought ( if you 'll listen ) - and some are - and that is truly incredible . There is a modern day Jesus/Mohammad/Buddha ( those , among others , that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical ) alive today and she life in Texas . I know some of you know what I 'm talking about . I do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but I have never felt more at home or a comfortable in the Universe a I do now .",1
"In 1993 , with the success of the first season of Batman : The Animated Series , Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie , originally slated for Direct-To-Video , but bumped up to theatrical status . It would become known a Batman : Mask of the Phantasm . Ten year after Phantasm , we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boy at the WB , Sub-Zero , Return of the Joker , and now , Mystery of the Batwoman join the family . The plot is basic and in many way similar to Mask of the Phantasm : A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman ha begun targeting operation run by Gotham mob bos Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin . Now , Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she cross the line . The animation is the sleeker , futuristic style that wa utilized for Batman : The Animated Series ' fifth and sixth season ( AKA The New Batman Adventures ) . , it 's quite nicely done , and just a sleek a Return of the Joker 's animation . There is also some use of CGI , but it 's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero . The music wa alright . Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score , although the point in the score when the old animated Batman theme come up will be sure to send wave of nostalgia through the older fan ' rodent-shaped heart . Kevin Conroy , a always , doe a wonderful job a Bruce Wayne and Batman . It 's also great to have the old Batman : The Animated Series alumnus back ; that includes Bob Hastings ( Commissioner Gordon ) , Robert Costanzo ( Detective Bullock ) , Tara Strong ( Barbara Gordon/Batgirl ; her cameo hint at the romantic-relationship between her and Bruce that wa mentioned in Batman Beyond ) , and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. ( Alfred ) . Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne , the old mob bos from the original series , appears for the first time since the fourth season . Overall , while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten year ago , MOTB carry on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman film . And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan , you will love the five-minute short Chase Me .",1
"I think this movie wa supposed to be shocking . But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it 's been made ... and simply is . It 's one-and-a-half hour of torment . Even more so for the viewer than for the character in the movie ( the five girl ) . Sure the main character get their bloody piece in a bad way , which is basically fine , since it 's a horror-movie . And I ( usually ) like horror-movies . I 've no problem with violence in these type of movie per se . However all the violence in this film serf no end whatsoever . It 's no spectacle other than that it 's simply grotesque . It 's so lame it even get boring , and really quick too . The worst thing ( if the above wa n't bad enough for ya ) about this movie is that they 've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project , by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras . But ( again , this too ) serf no end whatsoever . In the `` Blair Which '' , sure enough , there 's an explanation , namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch . In this film , there 's no other explanation than : `` Hey ya 'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch ! ! '' The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about . The girl are screaming so hysterically that many a time you ca n't make out what they 're saying . Also , no effort ha been made to make anything any better , sound-wise or other wise . Than finally , there 's the soundtrack , which is just a bad a the rest , and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock ... My advise : Do n't watch this under ANY circumstance .",0
"Why ca n't a movie be rated a zero ? Or even a negative number ? Some movie such a `` Plan Nine From Outer Space '' are so bad they 're fun to watch . THIS IS NOT ONE . `` The Dungeon of Horror '' might be the worst movie I 've ever seen ( some of anyway . I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it ! ) . Fortunately for the indiscretion of my youth and senility of my advancing age , there may be worse movie I 've seen , but thankfully , I ca n't remember them . The set appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with can of spray paint . The special effect looked like a fifth grader 's C+ diorama set in a shoebox . The movie contained unforgivable gaff such a when the Marquis shoot and kill his servant . He then immediately get into a scuffle with his escaping victim , who take his flintlock and shoot him with it , without the gun having been reloaded ! This movie wa so bad my DVD copy only had name credit . I guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated . Though I guess when you film in your garage and make set out of cardboard box a studio is n't needed . This movie definitely rank in my cellar of all time worst movie with such horrible sacrilege a `` The Manipulator '' , the worst movie I have ever seen with an actual ( one time ) Hollywood leading man-Mickey Rooney . The only time I would recommend watching `` The Dungeon of Harrow '' ( or `` The Manipulator '' for that matter ) would be if someone were to pay you . ( I 'm kind of cheap ) I 'd have to have $ 7 or $ 8 buck for `` Dungeon '' and at least ten for `` Manipulator '' . phil-the never out of the can cinematographer",0
"This movie took me by surprise . The opening credit sequence feature nicely done animation . After that , we 're plunged into a semi-cheesy production , betraying it low budget . The character , typical American teen , are introduced slowly , with more personal detail than is usually found in movie like this . By the time the shlitz hit the fan , we know each one of the character , and either like or hate them according to their distinct personality . It 's a slow uphill set-up , kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster . Thankfully , once the action kick in , it 's full blown old school HORROR ! Steve Johnson 's make-up effect are awesome . Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted film . And the scare are jolting . Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever , with heart-stopping surprise and creepy suspenseful set-ups . The tongue-in-cheek , sometimes cheesy , humor mark this film a pure 80 horror , a opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like `` Night of the Living Dead '' or `` Hills Have Eyes . '' But for true horror fan , this one is worth checking out . Play it a the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of `` House on the Haunted Hill . '' The set-up and character dynamic are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking ?",1
"Though I 'd heard that `` Cama de Gato '' wa the worst Brazilian movie of the decade , I watched it giving it a chance ; after all , first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature ( shot in video ) for just US $ 4,000 and -- though it look even cheaper -- I ca n't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theater with no big sponsor or production company behind it ( then a I watched it I realized why ) . But whatever chance you 're ready to give to `` Cama de Gato '' , they shrink to zero within 10 minute : it 's an unbelievably preposterous , verbose , ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth a a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex , drug and violence ( and they 're made to look like closeted gay too ) , made with no visible trace of talent , imagination , expertise or notion of structure . Visually and aurally , it recall the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it last NINETY TWO ( count'em ) minute of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness , and it 's not even funny-bad . We 've all seen the story before : bored young guy want to have fun , go partying , take drug and everything go wrong -- there 's gang-rape , spanking , murder , the accidental death ( falling down the staircase ! ! ) of the mother of one of the boy , culminating with the boy deciding to burn the corps of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill . Moral and literal garbage , get it ? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark ( especially `` Kids '' and `` Bully '' ) , but Clark 's film -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap . I do n't think there wa ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his idea down the audience 's throat : Stockler grab u by the collar and try to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brain by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling , yelling , inept direction , shaky camera and terrible acting going on . Stockler doe n't care a bit about technique ( the quality of the image , framing , sound recording , soundtrack song , dialog , set , editing , etc is uniformly appalling ) , but he 's a narcissistic control-freak : he anticipates the criticism he 's bound to get by adding subtitle with smartie/cutie comment , and by making the protagonist comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is ( I could relate to THAT ) . Despite his megalomaniac ambition , Stockler seems incapable of giving u a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he ca n't even decide if he want gritty realism ( hand-held video camera etc ) or stylization ( repetition of scene , use of alternate take , etc ) . Damn , he ca n't even decide WHERE to put his camera ( there 's use of subjective camera for the THREE lead ) ! The dialog feature some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever ; the plot exists simply to justify the director 's profound hatred for his character and what they stand for . All you see is a filmmaker being hateful , preachy , condemning , moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent ( or technique ) to go with it . It 's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess . Certainly one of the most promising young film actor in Brazil , with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog look and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo 's , Blat can be highly effective under good direction ( a in `` Carandiru '' , `` Lavoura Arcaica '' , `` Proibido Proibir '' ) . Here , he 's told to go over the top and he ha to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped `` actor '' in recent memory . He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scene ( so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn ) . The film open and end with real interview with `` typical '' ( ? ) middle-class youth -- Stockler want u to take those interview a `` proof '' of what he 's trying to preach in fiction . But he blatantly despises and make fun of his interviewee , selecting a highlight of abject , racist , sexist , stupid statement ( which only show asshole exist everywhere ) . Stockler want to prove that Brazilian middle-class youth are ALL present or future fascist BECAUSE they 're middle-class and enjoy recreational drug ( is he saying all neo-fascists are on drug ? ? Or that drug potentialize fascist behavior ? ? I could n't tell ) . With it dogmatic self-righteousness , headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom , `` Cama de Gato '' is bad for a 1,000 reason but , above all , it 's harmful in a very insidious manner : it give detractor of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument . `` Cama de Gato '' is best unwatched , unmentioned , buried and forgotten .",0
"An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time , this wa a very touching bittersweet cartoon . I remember this very well from my childhood , it wa funny and sad and very beautiful . Well it start out a bit dark , a dog who escaped the pound , and get killed by an old friend , end up in Heaven , and come back . But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animal . Some scene were a bit scary contrary to other cartoon , like the dream sequence of Charlie , but everything else wa okay , and the song were fair . A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise , I just love that guy , ahehehe . And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge , may God rest her soul , poor girl , she did n't deserve to die , but she is in Heaven now , all good people go to Heaven . Overall this is a very good animated movie , a Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame . Recommended for the whole family . And know this , if you have the original video of this , you 'll find after the movie , Dom DeLuise ha a very important and special message , got ta love that guy , ahehehe .",1
"This movie wa a failure a a comedy and a film in general . It wa a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message , but the message wa a cliché , hopeless mess to begin with . This movie fall on shameless environmental point , even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet . In sitting through this , I could n't help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line . The only thing that could hypothetically mark this a a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief line to Wanda Sykes . Her character get frequent , cringe-worthy line where they absolutely do not fit . Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty , Evan Almighty blow it whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot device that turn out to barely advance the plot . The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan 's ark , but by the end , we learn that the ark wa completely meaningless , and the whole plot wa a just a vessel for the stupid gag and even stupider message . The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark , flood , and animal gathering wa just a weak political statement by none other than God . Yes , God wa trying to influence politics .",0
"It is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance . I had no guess a to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated a a film worth seeing . If you loved Bulgakov 's book you would be , understandably , afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story 's deeper meaning to the screen . There are a couple example of this with the Master and Margarita . As complex and far-fetched a the story is , the movie leaf out nothing . It is a if the filmmaker read Bulgakov 's work the same way an orchestral conductor read a score -- with not a note missed . Why ca n't we find such talent here in the U.S. ? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title .",1
"This movie is very violent , yet exciting with original dialog and cool character . It ha one of the most moving story and is very true to life . The movie start off with action star Leo Fong a a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career , when he stumble on to a big case that involves corruption , black mail and murder . This is where the killing start . From start finish Fong delivers in this must see action caper . This movie also co-star Richard Roundtree . I really enjoyed this film a a child but a I got older I realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good . I would not recommend this film and the action is very , very bad .",0
"The day ha finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumi 's fate a an assassin , fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga . That 's a poetical a I 'll get when talking about Azumi 2 : Death or Love , because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin , after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcoming more than ever before . Not only doe the determination of each assassin feel sluggish and uninspiring but also many important element are omitted from the entire experience . In Azumi 1 we saw the assassin use various stealth tactic ( which is their number one priority ) a well a logic to make easy work of their mark with swift execution and quicker ability to escape . But I wo n't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacle are planted in Azumi 's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any sign of charisma . By the way , Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go , minus the cool weapon and sense of menace . This brings me to the final blow which is the action , simply disguised in the title a the 'Death ' side of the epic . In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversary with flashy look and even flashier weapon . To no one 's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film fall short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily . In Azumi 1 , the young assassin were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battle and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fight in Azumi 2 wa at least climaxed and worthwhile . Some interesting effect were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter . I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai film with their quick and realistic battle but character in both Azumi film were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rule could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched . The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scene and unfortunately at the end it serf no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution . As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movie and animation , I wo n't lie and I 'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film , but I 'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2 , the original wa made to look like a flawless masterpiece . For what it 's worth , Azumi 2 : Death or Love could have gone straight to video , with it invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassin , doing their best to restore the peace , with an unwavering courage to die trying .",0
"This ha to be the worst piece of garbage I 've seen in a while . Heath Ledger is a heartthrob ? He looked deformed . I wish I 'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hour of my life wondering what she saw in him . Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob ? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him , I ca n't say I agree . Rachel Griffiths wa her usual fabulous self , but Geoffrey Rush looked a if he could n't wait to get off the set . I 'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderer ? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy , which actually WAS an entertaining film . This wa trite , cliche-ridden and boring . We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better . It did n't . The last 10-15 minute or so were unintentionally hilarious . Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel , and woman and child are dying because of their presence . That 's not funny . But it wa funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on , because all we could think of wa the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail . I kept waiting for them to say `` I 'll bite yer leg off ! '' We were howling with laughter , a were several other warped member of the audience . When we left , pretty much everyone wa talking about what a waste of time this film wa . I may not have paid cash to see this disaster ( sneak preview ) , but it certainly wa n't free . It cost me 2 hour of my life that I will never get back .",0
"A very ordinary made-for-tv product , `` Tyson '' attempt to be a serious biopic while stretching the moment of angst for effect , fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing , and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which make Tyson even remotely interesting . A lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fan .",0
"I 'm sure deep in the recess of Jack Blacks mind the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it is n't . You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy , slimy Mexican friar with dream of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department . I just sat there through most of the movie thinking `` Is this supposed to be funny '' and `` This is the guy from Tenacious D right ? '' . The truth is this film ha NOTHING to offer . AT ALL ! It 's a lousy script with crappy character and really naff acting and direction . You 'll watch endless moment where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doe n't . I wa bored stupid about 10 minute in but though it would surely pick up . It did n't . 90 minute later I 'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it wa that painful . It 's like , remember year ago when you 'd see anything with your fave actor in it , even some of their really early pap from before they were famous , and you 'd be really embarrassed that said actor wa actually in such a load of plop . Yeah it 's like that . I 've enjoyed some of Jack Black 's earlier movie like Shallow Hall and I 'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man . If you do this to u again Jack I 'm gon na have to come round there and hammer your kneecap or something . At the least give you a serious talking to . I know it 's a cliché but this is one of the worst movie I 've ever seen and for so many reason ....",0
"I have n't read the Anne Rice novel that this movie wa based on , but who know , maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health . It is n't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health , but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercise the active part of your brain more so than this movie . You can count the number of page by Anne Rice that I 've read on one hand , but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire , I get the feeling that she writes really good novel . The plot for both movie hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history . Still , Stuart Townsend 's voice-over narration get a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt 's vampire narrative ever did , and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED 's limited production resource barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline . While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance , QUEEN relies on low budget special effect that try really hard to be taken seriously . One can see that the original novel had potential a a movie and that the production team focused it attention in the wrong place . The costume and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack . However , I 'll give credit where credit is due . The soundtrack is excellent . Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead . The film open with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage , but after the first ten minute or so , the directing degenerate quickly . It 's a if the movie wa so long that the director realized that there wa n't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice . What result are some mediocre vampire scene and plenty of cheesy special effect . Unfortunately , QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just a it John Carpenter counterpart fail to impress . Where are the yellow contact ? Where 's the pale blue make-up ? Scene after scene , I shook my head reminiscing about the day of Salem 's Lot and Fright Night when low budget wa done right . There are redeeming quality though that save this movie from being garbage . Props to Aaliyah , and may her soul forever rest in peace . She might have become a renowned actress , had her life not been taken from u so prematurely , for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing . Did I mention that the soundtrack wa good ? Let 's see , what else can I say ? It wa n't too long . The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hand on it . There are a few twist and turn here and there in the plot . But all in all it wa a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movie out there . The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tell you anything . JY Jimboduck-dot-com",1
"While I count myself a a fan of the Babylon 5 television series , the original movie that introduced the series wa a weak start . Although many of the element that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there , the pace of The Gathering is slow , the makeup somewhat inadequate , and the plot confusing . Worse , the characterization in the premiere episode is poor . Although the rating chart show that many fan are willing to overlook these problem , I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series .",0
"Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide . What film wa he looking at ? Kid Vengeance or God 's Gun are bomb . This film is a delight . It is fantastic . It is literate . It is well mounted . It is beautiful photographed , making a brilliant use of color . Right from the opening scene the film grab your attention and tip you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre . The film is played for laugh from the beginning to the end with homage to Douglas Fairbanks , 77 Sunset Strip , and the famous showdown in the Good , the Bad , and the Ugly . Edd Byrnes , George Hilton , and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work . It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly a it is undeserved . One can only guess a to his reason . I suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and wa expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be . Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project . This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movie and appreciate satire .",1
"I do n't believe there ha ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States a The 700 Club . They are today 's equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century . Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand . Their daily constant attack upon million and million of Americans , a well a billion of human the world over , who do n't happen to share their bigoted , cruel , monstrous , and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television ha ever seen . The lie they spout and the ridiculous lie they try to pas off a truth , such a the idea of `` life after death '' or `` god '' or `` sin '' or `` the devil '' is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill , so lost are they in their fantasy . Sane people know that religion is a drug and should n't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy . However , The 700 Club is in a class by itself . They are truly a cult . While I believe in freedom of speech , they way they spread hatred , lie , disinformation , and such fantastic idea is beyond all limit . I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way , people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all . Treatment for such afflicted individual is sorely needed in this country , a so many people have completely lost their mind to the fantasy of religion . The 700 Club though , is even more horrible a it rise to the legal definition of 'cult ' but due to The 700 Club 's vast wealth ( conned daily from the million of Americans locked in their deceitful grip ) they are above the law in this country . For those of you who have seen the movie `` The Matrix '' you know that movie wa a metaphor for religion on earth : the evil one who are at the top of each of the religion who drain the one they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purpose , and those million who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religion and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them . In le civil time , the good townsfolk would have run such monster a those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torch and pitchfork . But in today 's world where people have lost all choice in their choice of television that is presented to them , we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague . The television rating system and the `` V '' chip on TV 's should also have a rating called `` R '' for religion , so that rational people and concerned parent could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape , such a presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country , from themselves and their child .",0
"If you wish to see Shakespeare 's masterpiece in it entirety , I suggest you find this BBC version . Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hour but Jacoby 's performance a Hamlet and Patrick Stewart 's a Claudius are well worth the effort . It never cease to amaze me how clear `` Hamlet '' is when you see it in it length and order a set down by the Bard . Every film version of `` Hamlet '' ha tinkered with it structure . Olivier concentrated on Hamlet 's indecision , Gibson on his passion . Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspect of Hamlet 's character together with the aid of Shakespeare 's full script . Why doe Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately ? Hamlet say `` I am very proud , revengeful , ambitious ... '' Hamlet is extremely upset , not only for his father 's death ( and suspected murder ) , or his mother 's marriage to his uncle , but also , and mostly , because Claudius ha usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet . He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius ( marriage between royal kin is not unknown ; done for political reason ) but that her marriage solidified Claudius ' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself . He is , therefore , impotent to do anything about it . And this is true even after he hears his father 's ghost cry vengeance . He can not simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so . He must `` out '' the King 's secret and here is the tragedy ! At the moment Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius ' guilt in public , he ha opportunity to kill him and doe not . WHY ? He want it ALL ! He want revenge , the throne AND the damnation of Claudius ' soul in hell . Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form . His own HUBRIS is his undoing . He kill Polonius thinking it is Claudius and the rest of the play spiral down to the final death of Rosencrantz , Guildenstern , Ophelia , Laertes , Gertrude , Claudius and Hamlet himself .",1
"The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New World ( America ) . Salvatore , a middle-aged man who hope for a more fruitful life , persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily , take the arduous journey across the raging sea , and inhabit a land whose river supposedly flow with milk . In short , they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dream of prosperity will be fulfilled . The imagery of the New World is optimistic , clever and highly imaginative . Silver coin rain from heaven upon Salvatore a he anticipates how prosperous he 'll be in the New World ; carrot and onion twice the size of human being are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health , and river of milk are swam in and flow through the mind of those who anticipate what the New World will yield . All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the character and help nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience . The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people help provide hope while they 're aboard the ship to the New World . The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness , especially when the sea tempest roar and nearly kill the people within . The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World . The Old World is depicted a somewhat destitute and primitive . This is shown a Salvatore scramble together to sell what few possession he ha left ( donkey , goat and rabbit ) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he need to enter the New World . I thought it wa rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World ; it wa almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized a morally fit . The most powerful image in the film wa when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the New World . This shot show an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another , depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds . This shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that wa once familiar , wanted to divorce from their previous dark living condition and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise . As later contrasted to how the New World visually look , the Old World seems dark and bleak a compared to the bright yet foggy New World . I thought it wa particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island , but is remained hidden . I think this wa an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stand for : `` Give me your poor , your tired , your hungry '' seemed like a joke in regard to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World . Once they arrived in the Americas , they had to go through rather humiliating test ( i.e . delousing , mathematics , puzzle , etc . ) in order to prove themselves a fit for the New World . These test completely changed the perspective of the Sicilian people . In particular , Salvatore 's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rule and law of the New World , feeling more violated than treated with respect . Where their dream once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide , the reality of what the New World required wa disparaging and rude . Salvatore doe n't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually wa seemed disappointing to him . This attitude wa shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him . Their character arc deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted . The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society . Cleanliness , marriage and intelligence are prerequisite . Adhering to these rule is to prevent disease , immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating . Perhaps this is a commentary on how America ha learned from the failing of other nation and so wa purposefully established to secure that these plague did not infest and destruct . Though the rule seemed rigid , they were there to protect and help the people flourish .",1
"Nifty little episode played mainly for laugh , but with clever dollop of suspense . Somehow a Martian ha snuck aboard a broken-down bus on it way to nowhere , but which passenger is it , ( talk about your illegal immigrant ! ) . All-star supporting cast , from wild-eyed Jack Elam ( hamming it up shamelessly ) , to sexy Jean Willes ( if she 's the Martian , then I say let 's open the border ! ) , to cruel-faced John Hoyt ( the most obvious suspect ) , along with familiar face John Archer and Barney Phillips ( and a nice turn from Bill Kendis a the bus driver ) .

I never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really wa . It 's just plain awful ! It is no where near in the same league a The Transformers , He-man or Thundercats and wa very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made . I only watch it on Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 come on straight after it ( that 's if mask doe n't put me to sleep first ) .

"Phantasm .... Class . Phantasm II ..... awesome . Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible . Even though i would love to stick up for this film , i quite simply ca n't . The movie seems to have `` sold out '' . First bad sign come when the video ha trailer for other film at the start ( something the others did not ) . Also too many pointless character , prime example the kid ( who is a crack shot , funny initially but soon you want him dead ) , the woman who us karate to fight off the ball ( erm not gon na work , or rather should n't ) and the blooming zombie ( what the hell are they doing there , there no link to them in the other Phatasms ) . Also there is a severe lack of midget running about . The only good bit are the cracking start and , of course , Reggie B . ( Possible SPOILER coming Up ) To me this film seems like a filler between II and IV a extra character just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV . Overall very , VERY disappointing . 3 / 10",0
"Ludicrous . Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turn into whiny brat 19-year-old Annakin , who somehow seems appealing to Amidala , 5 year his senior . Now 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin ha a couple of bad dream , and so take to slaughtering child , his friend , and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a ) his precious wife might really die , and b ) only he can prevent this . Ludicrosity squared . I think the people who like this movie are not paying attention . The story is ridiculous . The character are unbelievable ( literally , not the perverted sense of `` fantastic '' , `` wonderful '' , etc. ) . Obi-wan Kenobi wa the wise and kind anchor for the entire series , but in the climax , he hack off Annakin 's leg , let him burn in the lava , and leaf him to suffer . Does n't anyone think that 's a little out of character ? Not to mention it wa pretty stupid to take a chance on him living , a it turn out . I wa expecting at least a story that showed consistent character with plausible motivation . None of that here . The story could have been written by a 10 year old . Oh yeah , the CGI is pretty cool .",0

"If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it , this film is actually quite entertaining . It 's got action , adventure and romance , and one of the premiere casting match-up of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead role . As evident on this board , the picture doe n't pas muster with purist who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling . To get beyond that , one need only put aside the history book , and enjoy the story a if it were a work of fiction . I know , I know , that 's hard to do when you consider Custer 's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it 's prominence in the history of post Civil War America . So I guess there 's an unresolved quandary with the picture , no matter how you look at it . There 's a lot to take in here though for the picture 's two hour plus run time . Custer 's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher , riding up a he doe in full military regalia . The practical joke by Sharp ( Arthur Kennedy ) putting him up in the Major 's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble . Ironically , a lot of scene in this military film play for comedy , a in Custer 's first meeting with Libby Bacon , and subsequent encounter that include tea reader Callie ( Hattie McDaniel ) . I had n't noticed it before in other film , but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties , Mantan Moreland . So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress . With that in mind , the owl scene wa a hoot too . As for Flynn , it 's interesting to note that a year earlier , he portrayed J.E.B . Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan 's depiction of General Custer in `` Santa Fe Trail '' , both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland . In that film , Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers , while in Flynn 's portrayal here it 's more than evident . But it doe n't come close to that of Richard Mulligan 's take on the military hero in 1970 's `` Little Big Man '' . Let 's just say that one wa a bit over the top . The better take away the picture had for me wa the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture . That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story . Most poignant wa that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn , in which he declared that hell or glory wa entirely dependent on one 's point of view . Earlier , a similar remark might have given u the best insight of all into Custer 's character , when he stated - `` You take glory with you when it 's your time to go '' .",1
"The film quickly get to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction . The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal 's driving , but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie . It seems like they decided to make all kind of change in the movie plot , so just plan to enjoy the action , and do not expect a coherent plot . Turn any sense of logic you may have , it will reduce your chance of getting a headache . I doe give me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back towards the type of character he portrayed in his more popular movie .",0
"Interesting and short television movie describes some of the machination surrounding Jay Leno 's replacing Carson a host of the Tonight Show . Film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno . The film doe a good job of sparking viewer ' interest in the event and showing some of the concern of the stakeholder , particularly of the NBC executive . The portrayal of Ovitz wa particularly compelling and interesting , I thought . Still , many of the character were only very briefly limned or touched upon , and some of the acting seemed perfunctory . Nevertheless , an interesting story .",0
"Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company ha no latter-day peer in my opinion , respectfully . The confluence of so many thing near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive : a a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspect of World War Two and particularly naval warfare , I favor depiction of sub and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of thing . For those unacquainted with target priority , an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here . The pacing is deliberate and typical of the work coming out of the Ealing , Rank and British-Gaumont studio back in the day : frankly I prefer it quieter , more cerebral approach for it humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could . This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger 's The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman , a favorite of mine . John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the title , so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman 's film but the whole cast shine . As for the title sequence , am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Production 's lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl ?",1
"A brilliant horror film . Utterly gruesome and very scary too . The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter , but please , do not let that put you off this film . It is simply brilliant . The start of the film ha the alien 's spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth century before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film 's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'THE THING ' . One of the best opening credit for a horror film ever . The cast of actor who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the location for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen . It must have been great in the cinema . I regret not seeing this on the big screen . Kurt Russell is excellent a Macready , the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that ha infiltrated their base . All the actor in this are really good and create terrific scene of paranoia and tension a to who the thing ha infected . My favourite scene in the whole film ha to be when Macready test everyone thats still alive for infection , it is tense , scary and finally spectacular . I love it because it funny a well . Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effect and shape changing design of the alien itself . If he did n't get an Oscar for best visual effect at the time then he damn well should have . This is also debatable a to whether this is John Carpenter 's greatest film ... it certainly a gruesome masterpiece . Wait for a cold winter night . Get some Budweiser from the fridge . Sit down and watch The Thing , a horror masterpiece of flame throwing hero fighting shape changing tower of gore and slime . Utterly brilliant . Ten Out Of Ten .",1

"No one can say I wa n't warned a I have read the review ( both user & external ) , but like most of u attracted to horror movie ... curiosity got this cat . ( Come on , we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room , but you know that 's horror aficionado are always dying to know what 's in there even if we know it 'll be bad ) . The bottom line is that this movie left me angry . Not because it pretend to be real ( who care ... gimmick are allowed ) , or because the actor and dialogue are so lame ( is this an unusual event in horror movie ? ) or even because the movie is so bad ( and I am being polite here ) . What really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of BWP , but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that . I do n't believe in sacred cow and if they thought they could outdo BWP then kudos to them , but they did n't even try . The movie wa made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror ( or any ) movie !",0

"I have seen most , if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic film . I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly , even after watching it over and over again . This new film attempt to bring back the classic with two new actor who resemble both Laurel & Hardy , however fails miserably for various reason . One of which is how out of place their cloth are ( still early 20th century ) however are both portrayed in the 90 's setting . Some of the former dialogue wa brought back , however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series . This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever . The real Laurel & Hardy are surly spinning in their graf at such a bad imitation .",0

Pretty Woman for me doe two thing , two terrible horrible ghastly thing , firstly it portrays prostitution a a career more akin to that of a dancer , you know with absolutely great friend , leg warmer lot of giggling , borrowing each others make up . You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we 're talking about here , ha a great life , she 's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament . My feeling is this 'happy Hooker ' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character , which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristic familiar to that role then why do it ? If I make a film about a chef but do n't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place ? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story miss the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social question that it could have , what a cop out , really really lame . Secondly , 'Pretty Woman ' insult romance itself , Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere ha no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady ' that is without his plastic friend , yep do n't leave home without it , especially if you are a moron in a suit who ha no imagination . 8 out of 10 of his romantic moment involve splashing cash in one way or another , even when he first meet her it 's the Lotus Esprit turbo that doe all the work , necklace here diamond there limo over there , money money money , where 's the charm ? where 's the charisma , do n't mention that attempt at the piano please . Girls who like this film will also be girl who like shopping more than most . Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy ha le charm than a calculator , a they probably do n't either so it wont have registered . More importantly anyone who like this film will hate 'Thieves Highway ' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject . I 'll finish on a song : Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman , the kind I like to treat Pretty woman , I do n't believe you You 're not the truth No one could spend a much a you Mercy Pretty woman , wont you pardon me Pretty woman , I could n't help but see Pretty woman , and you look lovely a can be do you lack imagination just like me Pretty woman , shop a while Pretty woman , talk a while Pretty woman , sell your smile to me Pretty woman , yeah , yeah , yeah Pretty woman , look my way Pretty woman , say you 'll stay with me .. and I 'll pay you .. I 'll treat you right",0
"This movie wa terrible . The plot wa terrible and unbelievable . I can not recommend this movie . Where did this movie come from ? This movie wa not funny and wasted the talent of some great actor and actress including : Gary Sinise , Kathy Bates , Joey Lauren Adams , and Jennifer Tilly .",0
"I strongly dislike this show . I mean , like , basically everyone at that school is perfect , and rich , and I doubt a boarding school would look a cool a that . And why do they suddenly allow girl into the school ? Is n't that just a little weird ? anyways , Jamie Lynn spear CAN NOT act . She always ha the same facial expression , which really annoys me . She is basically emotionless , and all the guy seem to like her . and should n't chase tell her he like her ? it not that hard ! really ! None of this show is real life , and she is n't `` a girl like me '' because majority of the regular girl do NOT go to boarding school , do not have designer clothes , and do NOT live by the beach . fake fake fake .",0
"Normally I do n't like series at all . They 're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast . These series however , are well played , the story follows through all episode and even if you miss one , the story will still be catching your mind . The episode are all filmed on a hospital and take you further and further in to the mystery of dark and old secret that lie just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital .",1
"holy Sh * t this wa god awful . i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minute and i thought i wa going to gouge out my eye much in the manor Oedipus Rex . dear god . this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff . please save your money , this movie can offer you nothing . unless you enjoy sideshow and sleeping in movie theater . you know , h3ll , bring your girlfriend and make thing interesting . you will be the only one there anyway . F @ ck this slide show . Ye Be Warned . I recommend not watching this . hello . how are you ? I 'm pretty good . enjoying this day ? I am . this comment wa one-hundred time more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie . this is sad .",0
"This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10 .. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grade because it ha no `` good plot '' or anything like that , thats ridiculous , saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of it plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it ha no plot ! you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES , for the action it not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that , if you look at how he make movie and compare it to other American film from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan 's movie had over the top fight scene and not really good plot while American movie had good plot but shitty action scene compared to what Jackie Chan wa doing at the time . Porn is watched for the porn , Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION , i think you people are rating it bad because there 's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained . Sure the middle of the movie wa boring , VERY BORING , but put it this way the rest which is all action scene and stunt very much do pay for all of that . This did change the way how American action movie were created , they have even stollen scene from this movie . If you want a true man , a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan 's , he pure in everyway . He literally make American movie look like a walk in the park , and even in TODAYS movie . American movie rely so much on special effect and safety wire and stunt double and so much more . Police Story and many other Jackie Chan film are piece of work of a true entertainer who just go all out and is very talented in what he can do . a masterpiece",1
"I saw this at the London Film Festival last night , apparently the shorter version . James McNally 's summary of the content of the film is very good . Nossiter very deftly blend his investigation of the wine business into wider concern about globalisation , homogenisation , the effect of the mass medium , the power of capital and the need for diversity . The film is shot on hand-held DV which some might find offputting , but which doe enable Nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasion which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment . Despite the sprawling feel of the film , the editing is very sharp , not only giving u a parade of the world 's dog , but also undercutting a number of interviewee ' comment with somewhat contradictory visual image , and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves . To a degree this evoked Michael Moore 's recent work ( although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way ) , but probably the root of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls ' `` The Sorrow and the Pity '' , both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of 'salt of the earth ' French peasant a the star . De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered question afterwards . We do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo Hubert ! Overall an excellent film with implication that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves a people , and organise our world .",1
"I ca n't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 ! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring , certainly one of the worst film I have seen in a long , long time . In a no-budget way , it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck . This film should be avoided at all cost . It 's one of those `` festival film '' that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it make it `` different '' , therefore good . Bad film-making is not `` different '' , it 's just bad film-making .",0
"This movie really woke me up , like it wake up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber . This guy John ( Ben Chaplin ) lead his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town , until the stunningly gorgeous , wild , girl-to-die-for Nadia ( Nicole Kidman ) , ordered by email from Russia , enters his life to become his beloved wife , by Johns plan . However a glitch turn up - Nadia doe not speak a word of Johns language . Although calm and emotionless on the outside , John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service , he buy her a dictionary to start the communication process . What happens henceforth in the plot really shake poor John from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure , giving the viewer a subliminal message `` you would have probably acted likewise '' . Kidman , Cassel & Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing , `` almost '' only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogue , however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the word sound right . Nicole Kidman prof her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous role , at least from the cultural background . The pace of the film is fast and captivating , and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end title appear , you rather feel that you 're in the middle of the plot , and are left with a desire to see the sequel a soon a it come out . My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy . To sum it up , it ha an unusual plot , great acting , and idea below the surface . Like the idea of the `` rude awakening '' from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Society 's machine , the life which member of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings ( `` Welcome to the machine ! '' ) . I bet that in the end , John wa rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all . Thank you , writer , for the great story , and everyone else for this great movie ! Please make a sequel ! And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever , because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewer , I am sure of it .",1
"Ed Wood ride again . The fact that this movie wa made should give any young aspiring film maker hope . Any screenplay you might have thought of using to line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad . Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids . Watching this movie made me realize that Boa vs. Python wa not that bad after all . It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation a at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film . It is understandable why this director ha so many alias . There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chip , then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surround you enabling you to make your toward your TV set 's cocoon of cheese that surround it .",0
"This sport a nice , deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actor and talk . The first third of this movie wa nothing but talk , and more talk . Most of that wa a bunch of woman bitching about everything to each other . The first five listed actor in here are woman so that verifies that it 's really a `` chick flick '' and little else . This probably play on the Lifetime network . There wa a quick murder scene and then more talk . By halfway through , they had lost me . By the way , Sally Field looked about 15 year old in here .",0
"I think this movie ha got it all . It ha really cool music that I can never get out of my head . It ha cool looking character . IS REALLY funny ( you know , the kind that you 'll crack up on the ground and you 'll keep saying the funny part over every day for three week ) .Despite the bad acting , bad cgi , and bad story ( about cop going after a robot ) , it really cool . Its one of those movie you and all of your family can watch , get together , eat pizza , laugh like crazy , and watch it two more time . There are so many funny part , like when Kurt wa trying to get Edison 's attention and gave him the finger , and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball . On that part , I kept saying `` Remember , Remember ? `` to my cousin who saw it and showed them what happened . There wa also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt wa there ( just before they fought ) and Kurt wa talking about his `` Strange dream '' and how he wa `` Superman '' . I LOVED that part , although it ha been a while since I saw it , so I do n't remember that part . Everything the actor said were funny , like how Kurt say , `` I worship you , like a GOD ! '' to the robot . Although there wa some bad thing , in all it wa a GREAT movie . Man , I ca n't stop laughing . I wish I had that movie . ) ;",1
"Howard ( Kevin Kline ) teach English at the high school in a small Indiana city . He is finally getting married to Emily ( Joan Cusack ) , much to his parent delight . The town is abuzz , too , because one of it own , Cameron ( Matt Dillon ) ha been nominated for an acting Oscar . Everyone , including Howard and Emily , is watching the Academy Awards on television a Cameron is declared the winner ! In his acceptance speech , Cameron announces that he wa able to fulfill his role a a gay military man , in part , because of lesson he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school . You guessed it , it Howard ! But , Howard ha never `` come out '' ; in fact , he belief he is straight ! With the whole town , and member of the medium , waiting and observing the happening , will Howard and Emily go ahead and get married ? Or , is Howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony ? This is a wonderful , funny , and humane film about a gay man and his situation . As the man-who-did-not-realize-he-was-gay , Kline is excellent and touching . The rest of the cast is equally fine , with Cusack a stitch a the mixed-up fiancé and Dillon , Bob Newhart , Debbie Reynolds , Tom Selleck , and others on hand to delight the audience a well . The costume are very nice and the setting in the lovely Indiana heartland is beautiful . Then , too , the script , the direction , and the production are very , very nice . But , the insightful , humorous , and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film 's best asset , no doubt . For those who would be offended by a gay-themed film , yes , just skip over this one . But , for everyone who want to laugh heartily , and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time , this is definitely the best film out there .",1
"When the opening shot is U.S. Marines seriously disrespecting the U.S. flag , a movie ha a tough road ahead , but unfortunately it wa downhill from there . There is a military adviser credited , who is also apparently a retired U.S. Marine , making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol , and law , went unnoticed . Even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a Marine is reported KIA , then buried , in very short order , without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body , or if there even wa a body . The U.S. government is still finding the missing from WWII , and it take month to identify the remains . Military shot down remain MIA for month or year and are only declared KIA when the remains have been positively identified , or after year of red tape . Here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of day or week . Maybe this happens in Denmark , but not in the U.S. Clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with , or respect for , the U.S. military . Beyond that , there are a number of other utterly laughable moment when character come up with zinger out of nowhere . There must have been some really extended meeting between auteur and actor a they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash . Having a script that worked might have helped , but this one seems to have been made up on the spot , working from Cliffs Notes . There 's no way to know if the script wa this awful originally , or if it wa the auteur , or the middle-management kid at the studio who bear responsibility . Either way , this is an awful movie that should have never been made .",0
"We usually think of the British a the expert at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age , with the like of The Four Feathers ( 1939 ) and Zulu , simply because the Imperial age wa , for the most part , British . Here , in The Wind and the Lion , we see a wonderful rendering of America 's own Imperial age . America 's projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who , despite her gentility , is smitten by the rough , manly nobility of her captor , who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn . ( Politically correct prig eager to see some slight of `` native '' people or culture can rest assured , that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterpart depict themselves on the current world stage . ) What make this story different are the terrific production value - faultless photography , composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history . Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eye of the son , every member of the family can identify with one of the character , whether it be Sean Connery 's noble brigand , Candace Bergen 's feisty heroine , John Huston 's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly 's spiffy , radiant , ruthless can-do lieutenant , Roosevelt 's `` Big Stick '' . There is a transcendent scene at the end , when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing Moor on his white steed . This is high adventure at it best .",1
"I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while ... what with all it 's raving review , nomination and medium attention . And I must say , the first quarter of the movie wa good ! It really portrayed the black music scene back then . However , a the movie wore on , me and my whole family were bored out of our wit . The singing just kept coming , one after the other . I mean seriously , just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT . Furthermore , I noticed hardly any character development in any of the character ; I just did n't care what happened to them ! Even when Eddie Murphy 's character died of a drug overdose , I knew I should have been sad , but I just could n't feel any emotion for that character . The character were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot , but there personality were not revealed enough to draw me in . Finally , the conflict wa simply not significant enough to make the viewer care , which go along with the lack of character development . This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray , Chicago , and Rent ( Ray and Chicago were wonderful movie in my opinion ) . Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doe n't really care about an overall story , yet would enjoy two hour of entertaining and fun singing performance .",0
"One of Starewicz 's longest and strangest short film follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange . The dog come upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold , but at night must protect the orange when he come enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary character . With the help of a stuffed cat , the dog get the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death . The Mascot feature new technique I have not yet seen in Starewicz 's film . The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation make for a new twist on Starewicz 's old style of puppetry . Live scene of moving car and people 's foot walking by a a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh . The honking of car and cry of street vendor is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shift to sound were costly and Starewicz 's utilization of the new technology seems like old hat . New puppet character in this film are frightening contribution to the devil 's club scene . Twigss and newspaper shred come to life . Skeletons of dead bird lay egg which hatch skeleton chick . Characters come flying in from all over on pat and pan and rocking horse . A new editing technique us quick zoom which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene . Overall , Starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demand of a new audience making this film one of the best example of his work .",1
"Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu . Being a male , I 'm probably not qualified to totally understand it , but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start . It is n't a bleak a it really wa and the treatment of woman wa probably even harsher . What make this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal character . Each ha their own `` thing '' that they contend with . Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider web , they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion . What I enjoyed about this movie is that it did n't go for cheap comedy when it could have . It did n't try to pound a lesson into u . The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human being who get to see the light . I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly , but , within this world , it needed to happen . Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the life of some pretty good people .",1
"Prussic gas , a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip , and the murder of college school girl at the hand of paid convict enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keep his face hidden within an office containing aquarium of turtle and fish . The inspector at Scotland Yard , Higgins ( IJoachim Fuchsberger ) and his superior Sir John ( Siegfried Schürenberg ) certainly have their hand full with this case . It all seems to center around student Ann Portland ( Uschi Glas ) , who , when she turn 21 , is to inherit a great deal of wealth . The girl who are targeted share a room with Ann , but the reason for their murder remains a mystery SY 's finest must figure out . The staff of the girl ' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain member of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise , talented enough to precisely strangle the neck of those attacked with the whip . Two prisoner are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what wa supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation . It 's a clever scheme where a driver , Greaves ( Günter Meisner ) meet the convict ( .. who hide in a barrel ) who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard . Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind , he give them order on who to kill and how . Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regard to the murder and why they are happening . Under suspicion are girl ' dormitory headmistress , her author brother , a sweaty , incredibly nervous chemistry teacher , a snooping gardener , and the Bannister . Some are red herring until they are disposed of , throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered . The ending feature multiple twist . Out of the Krimi film I 've seen , THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with it 's colorful killer , a convoluted plot yielding lot of surprise and potential suspect , & sordid shenanigan between adult and the college girl at the dormitory . I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain mastermind 's secret hideout with an alligator pit ( .. which is n't used ) , the fake bible/water pistol , when opened , fire the gas into the face of startled victim , the Greaves ' Royles Royce which ha latch that cause flap to darken the window without revealing the passenger in the back seat , and the peep hole used to spy on the girl in their room and while swimming . Many might consider Sir John a liability due to his bumbling , buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines Higgins ' ability to get at the truth ( .. perhaps poking fun at know-it-all British inspector who harm a case more than solve it ) .. I felt he wa used a comedy relief , particularly with his attempt at psychoanalyzing suspect and potential victim , often misunderstanding what are told to him . Higgins , using the skill adopted over his year a an investigator , instead follows the clues/facts , often avoiding Sir John a much a possible . Capable direction by the reliable Alfred Vohrer who keep the pace humming at a nice speed , and the screenplay is full of interesting character and lurid content .. the fact that so many of the adult surrounding the dormitory are suspect , any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shot behind those murdered girl ' execution . I 'd say this may be one of the best ( .. if not the best ) example of the Krimi genre , for it keep you guessing , always one more ace up it 's sleeve .. the revelation unearthed at the very end are quite eye-opening ( .. and , you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the string to top it all off ) .",1
"I wa very lucky to see this film a part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 only a few day ago . I must admit that I am very partial to movie that focus on human relation and especially the one which concentrate on the tragic side of life . I also love the majority of Scandinavian cinematic offering , there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the character are drawn . Character building in this film is extraordinary in it detail and it depth . This is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of character all with very particular personal situation and location within their community . The audience at the end of the screening wa very silent and pensive . I am still playing some of those scene in my mind and I am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness .",1
This movie is really bad . Most of it look like it wa filmed either in a park or a basement . There 's a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg . There are some worm that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppet with cardboard teeth . And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that make no sense at all . The whole thing is just laughable .,0
"I think this is one hell of a movie ........... We can see Steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all Segal movie there 's a message in it , without the message it would be one of many action/fighting movie but the message is what make segal movie great and special .",1
"I saw this movie in the theater , and wa thoroughly impressed by it . Then again , that wa when Claire Danes wa a good actress , not the foolish , arrogant , Hollywood-ized bitch she is today . Anyway , this film really struck me a one of the more raw , realistic , beautiful friendship film . How far would you really go for your best friend ? I wa moved to tear at the end , and still tear up when I watch it now ( I own it ) . I remember a soon a I left the theater , I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her . This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend . However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turn to you and asks if you 'd do something like that for her ....",1
"I 've seen this film literally over 100 time ... it 's absolutely jam-packed with entertainment ! ! ! Powers Boothe give a stellar performance . As a fan of actor such a William Shatner ( Impulse , 1974 ) and Ron Liebmann ( Up The Academy , 1981 ) I never thought an actor could capture the `` intensity '' like Shatner and Liebmann in those role , until I saw Boothe a Jim Jones ! As far a I 'm concerned , Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this film capture his best performance ! ! !",1
"The three main character are all hopeless , and yet you only feel sorry for one of them : Ernesto , hopelessly devoted to Mercedes . This wa part of the frustration : screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no-good Harry , to no avail . Then there 's the satisfaction : Steve Buscemi ha a great part a a transvestite , and Harvey Keitel 's moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible . When you least expect it , Quentin Tarintino is doing half a monologue , and Anthony Quinn turn Ernesto into a wealthy man . Time and again great moment appear in the story , but in the end it 's hard to know what to feel about this movie . It doe n't have a happy ending , or even a complete one , but it somehow feel right . This movie is strange , but then so am I ; no wonder I liked it .",1
"Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen wa a memorable one . She appears like a fresh scrubbed face `` tween '' slight and stringy , but undeniably Reese . I have always liked her a an actor , and had no idea she started this young with her career , go figure . I actually gained some respect for Reese to know who she wa so early on . I say that because whenever I have watched her perform , the character thus far , in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character , quite nicely in fact . Anyway , my first film experience with Reese wa the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland , somehow I assumed that wa her first time up `` at bat '' Not so , well done Reese",1
This game rank above all so far . I had the honor of playing mine on PS2 so the graphic were really good . The voice acting wa above standard . The difficulty level is just right . Wesker ha to be the best character in the RE series in my opinion . The story amazed me and took many different twist that I wa n't expecting . The only rating this game deserves is great .,1
"This movie is not worth anything . I mean , if you want to watch this kind of stuff , flip to Hollywood movie ! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name . Neal N Nikki seriously sucked ! Never watch this movie . As for the actor , it appears the acting gene skipped a generation . Tanisha could n't have worn le and Uday Chopra obviously wa just picked because he wa the director 's spoiled son . ( All of that Halla Re wa amazingly stupid ) The song are eh , and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it ...... Bottom line , I hated the movie . Do not let your kid watch it , and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it ! Buy the CD , if you must . ( As I said , the song are eh . ) At least it is better then the movie .",0
"This is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small rancher and farmer . It 's certainly all been done before and since . But The Violent Men is something special . What make it special is Barbara Stanwyck playing the role of vixen a she often did in her later film . She 's married to the crippled Edward G. Robinson who 's the cattle baron here , but Robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injury may have left him impotent . No matter to Barbara , whose need are being met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith . That doe n't sit well with either Dianne Foster who is Robinson and Stanwyck 's daughter , nor with Lita Milan who is Keith 's Mexican girl friend . The infidelity subplot almost take over the film , but Glenn Ford a the stalwart small rancher who is a Civil War veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here . He 's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often . I almost expect those famous word from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford 's mouth , `` I 'm a peaceable man . '' Would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men . The Fifties wa the age of the adult western , theme were entering into horse opera that had n't been explored before . The following year Glenn Ford would do another western , Jubal , one of his best which also explores infidelity a a plot component . There 's enough traditional western stuff in The Violent Men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap opera a well .",1
"Apparently , The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing show of self-mutilation a a way of coping with his abusive childhood . I use the word 'apparently ' because without listening to a director Andy Copp 's commentary ( which I did n't have available to me ) or reading up on the film prior to watching , viewer wo n't have a clue what it is about . Gorehounds and fan of extreme movie may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scene of splatter and unsettling real-life footage , but unless they 're also fond of pretentious , headache-inducing , experimental art-house cinema , they 'll find this one a real chore to sit through . 82 minute of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound , terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue , this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one 's sanity : if you 've still got all your marble , you 'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead ( I watched the whole thing , but am well aware that I 'm completely barking ! ) .",0
"This movie wa absolutely pathetic . A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three loser drool over bikini babe . At time I felt like I wa watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead . I could n't even sit through the whole movie . Emran Hashmi disappoints , and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all . Celina Jaitley wa not bad . The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris . It wa pretty hilarious . The song `` Sini Ne '' and it remix version were really good . You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster . All in all , it seems Emran doe n't have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time .",0
"I Feel the Niiiiiight Heat ! I feel your HEEAAAAAAAAAART-beat ! Something ai n't right ! '' Theme song written by B.J . Cook from Skylark- David Foster 's old band and wife . She also wrote the memorable theme from CBC 's `` Airwaves . '' OH Night Heat ! What a program ! Well-written , well-acted and totally classic . Crime solver and a good team and a dash of humour at the end . I 'd like to think this is really what detective do/did . Giambone wa a real favourite ! On a Canadian tip , I learned EVERY Canadian actor 's name and style from guest spot done on Night Heat . Everyone passed through the Night Heat set and like Law & Order , it wa story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama .",1
"This movie fails miserably on every level . I have an idea , let 's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east . Maybe if we 're lucky they 'll all be shot and killed and we wo n't have to ever have our time wasted by them again . Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life ? My god , I ca n't think of anything I 've ever seen that wa this bad . I 'd rather watch Ishtar 25 time in a row than sit through 10 minute of this sorry excuse for a film . If I ever happen to meet anyone who wa involved in this film , I 'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless . That 's my two cent .",0
"Yes i 'll say before i start commenting , this movie is incredibly underrated . Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell a is Morrissey a Dr glass . He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sport star . Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel us to manipulate his mind . The acting wa good ( apart from Thewlis ) Stone really ha a talent with this role . She 's slick , naughty and seductive and doe n't look a day older than she did in the first.She really impressed me ( like in Casino ) . Morrisey wa also good . He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it . Thewlis however wa lame . He ruined his character and wa over-the-top the whole way . He really sucked . Overall , this movie not a good the first but Stone is a hoot to watch . Just ignore Thewlis .",1
"Based on a Edgar Rice Burroughs novel , AT THE EARTH 'S CORE provides little more than mean to escape and give your brain a rest . A Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry ( Peter Cushing ) invents a giant burrowing machine , which he and his American partner ( Doug McClure ) use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mystery it may hold . They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creature having conflict with prehistoric monster . Cushing come across a an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying . Instead of being a bold adventurer , he come across effeminate . On the other hand McClure overacted enough to make himself also laughable . Caroline Munro play the pretty Princess Dia that refuse to leave her world near the center of the earth . Also in the cast are : Godfrey James , Cy Grant and Michael Crane .",0
"I have seen this film at least 100 time and I am still excited by it , the acting is perfect and the romance between Joe and Jean keep me on the edge of my seat , plus I still think Bryan Brown is the top . Brilliant Film .",1
"This show make absolutely no sense . Every week , two lady go to an estate to do some gardening , and every week without fail , they somehow stumble upon a murder . Because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder , right ? But even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder , would n't the smart thing to do be to tell the police ? You know , the people who can actually do something about it ... But every week , these two fool go around , polluting evidence , committing crime of their own , and , in some case , causing more murder . Once they do miraculously solve the murder , there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted . All the evidence ha been sabotaged . And you 'd think people who are covering up murder would think not to hire these two , would n't you ? Yay ! We 've solved the murder ! Now like every other week , let 's go and confront the murderer ourselves and , with no back-up , tell them that we know about it . There is no way we could get ourselves into any danger , is there ? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst show on television , and certainly the most ridiculous .",0
"This movie wa so bad it wa funny ! For awhile there I thought I wa actually watching a parody of a bad movie ( a la `` For Your Consideration '' ) . The `` cliffhanger '' scene at the end had me laughing until my inside hurt . The script wa dreadful enough , but coupled with Sean Young 's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail ( complete with flashback ) while dangling off a cliff -- make it a truly classically bad movie worth watching ! In fact the fakey shot in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie . I still ca n't believe how this thing got made . First of all , how did such a bad script get the green light ? How did star actor get attached ? Were they at low point in their career ? Questions , question .",0
"Meryl Streep is such a genius . Well , at least a an actress . I know she 's been made fun of for doing a lot of role with accent , but she nail the accent every time . Her performance a Lindy Chamberlain wa inspiring . Mrs. Chamberlain , a portrayed here , wa not particularly likable , nor all that smart . But that just make Streep 's work all the more remarkable . I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nomination . About the film , well , there were a couple of interesting thing . I do n't know much about Australia , but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story . I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some year ago , but it came through loud and clear yesterday . And it seems the Australian press is just a accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill a their American colleague . A pretty good film . A bit different . Grade : B",1
"'Airport 4 ' is basically a slopped together mess for Universal Studios to try and work a new twist - the Concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-the-sky ' formula . Bogged down with unintentional humor , the best of which is when George Kennedy stick his hand out of Concorde 's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft 's flight path , and the simple fact that these dumb passenger keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problem in the air . Many star in this one including Robert Wagner , Sylvia Kristel , Alain Delon , and Martha Raye a a nervous passenger . Not really related to the other 'Airport ' film .",0
"Supposedly a `` social commentary '' on racism and prison condition in the rural South of the 1970 's , `` Nightmare '' is full of bad Southern stereotype , complete with phoney accent . Not only would it be offensive to the sensibility of most American Southerners , this tawdry piece of work come off a just a thinly-disguised `` babe in prison '' movie -- especially in it uncut original version . Nevertheless , acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors , in particular , doe a good job of making viewer hate him -- even though he look somewhat uncomfortable in several scene . There 's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed , who appears a the lecherous warden , and Tina Louise ( previously Ginger of `` Gilligan 's Island '' ) made a rather believable sadistic prison guard . My grade : D .",0
"OK , I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday , because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it . But we decided it to watch it anyway . Just for hilarity purpose . And I 'm sorry , but this ha got to be , one of THE worst film in history . It began off alright , and we thought `` Ok this might actually be OK '' . But after about 10 minute , we were sadly mistaken . It began when the `` mysterious paint baller '' turned out to be the most obvious character , the Scouser/Australian ( I say that because he had an accent which could n't be identified ) , who 's acting might I just say , wa abysmal . Then it got to the end , and by that time , we had all lost the will to live . The paint ball final . The only thing I did like about this plot is that they did n't actually win , but annoyingly enough they won by default . And I know this ha nothing to do with it , but the name the team were given wa just awful . Critical Damage . I mean they could of picked a more awesome name , like `` The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ '' or something . Or that 's what the film should of been called anyway .",0
"Insignificant and low-brained ( haha ! ) 80 's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen , yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind . The special effect are tacky , the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraph ! `` The Brain '' take place in a typical quiet-American town setting , where every adolescent work in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flush cherry bomb down the toilet . It is here that a TV-guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling . Under the label of `` independent thinker '' , a giant cheesy brain sends out wave through television set and force innocent viewer to kill ! How cool is that ? Now , it 's up to the Meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world ! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from . There are obvious reference towards extraterrestrial life but that 's about it . Meh , who need a background in a movie like this , really ? There 's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the `` evil '' brain look like an over-sized sock-puppet . The only more or le interesting element for horror buff is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie . Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made `` Bloody Birthday '' ( guilty pleasure of mine ) and `` Plague '' . Both those are much better movie and they wisely decided to resign the film industry . The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale , whom horror fan will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator . A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity-factor and she 's obviously a great talent She ha exactly 3 movie on her repertoire of which THIS is her `` masterpiece '' . In her debut , she wa credited a 'runaway model ' and in `` 3 men and a baby '' , her character is referred to a 'one of Jack 's girl ' . I really wonder how she feel about her career a an actress",0
"Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC : `` It 's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family get wiped out by creep and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner `` `` And after GLC what next for Bronson ? `` `` We 're using a new angle . My family do n't get wiped out but I go after creep just the same `` This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO . It 's a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation is n't down to a blood feud but this lead to credibility becoming strained Bronson is a retired hit-man who is n't giving up his retirement for anything until someone show him a video tape featuring interview with the victim of `` The Doctor `` , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . It 's never really explained why The Doctor is so infamous since any police state ha a myriad of these sadist nor is it explained why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accent As you may guess it 's a lazily written movie and incident happening because the screenwriter need thing to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guy getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or thing being revealed like The Doctor 's sister being a lesbian so some T & A can be included In many way it 's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicle that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE two very well regarded war drama that are often shown on Sunday afternoon . Believe me this movie wo n't be shown until well after the watershed",0
"Well , here 's another terrific example of awkward 70 's film-making ! The rudimentary premise of `` What 's the matter with Helen ? '' is quite shocking and disturbing , but it 's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion ! In the hand of any other movie crew , this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale , but with director Curtis Harrington ( `` Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ? '' ) and scriptwriter Henry Farrell ( `` Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte '' ) in charge , it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of theme and genre . The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific , but there 's a lot more to experience , like love story , a swinging 1930 's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing ! The setting is unquestionably what make this movie so unique . We 're literally catapulted back to the 1930 's , with a sublime depiction of that era 's music , religion , theatrical business and wardrobe . Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their son to life-imprisonment for murder , Adelle ( Debbie Reynolds ) and Helen ( Shelley Winters ) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girl . Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment , a she fall in love with a local millionaire , but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia . She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist , fear that she will be punished for the crime her son committed and slowly develops violent tendency . The script , although not entirely without flaw , is well written and the film is adequately paced . There 's never a dull moment in `` What 's the matter with Helen '' , although the singing , tap-dancing and tango sequence are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot . But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefice from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters . She 's downright scary a the unpredictable and introvert lady who 's about to snap any second and , especially during the last ten minute or so , she look more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers , Jason Voorhees ' and Michael Myers ' combined ! There are several terrific supportive character who are , sadly , a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential , like Michéal MacLiammóir a the cocky elocution teacher , Agnes Moorehead a the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey a the obtrusive visitor to the lady ' house . There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scene and moment of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatic among u , but particularly the set piece and costume design ( even nominated for an Oscar ! ) are breathtaking .",1
"Resnais , wow ! The genius who brought u Hiroshima Mon Amour take on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour . The opening voice-over with old , embellished inter-titles wa a nice touch . Then the camera aperture open ( like the old hand crankers ) on a black & white placard . The camera back off ( or rather , up ) , suddenly showing u the surprisingly brilliant colour of an elegant table set for a tea party . This is all in the first 60 second . Then the music start . A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girl blabbering some nonsense which ha no relevance to the film ( and yes , I speak French , so I ca n't blame it on the subtitle ) . Those character whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song . Then they leave , and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minute into the film . I 'm not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony . But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittle at the screen and storm out . I endured . It did n't get much better . I 'll tell you why . There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the character . We do n't even see their face half the time ( a Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera ) . People flit on & off stage like moth around a lamp , and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot . It 's a if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie . With bad song . The only thing that kept me watching a long a I did ( 1 hour ) wa that I wa looking at the camera technique , lighting and scenery which were all , I admit , excellent . But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hour ? Not me . Maybe tomorrow I 'll try watching the end . Aw , who am I kidding . I have more important thing to do . I 'm sure you do , too . Skip this .",0
"I saw this movie in the middle of the night , when I wa flipping through the channel and there wa nothing else on to watch . It 's one of those film where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment ! - but realize after twenty minute or so that you just ca n't turn it off , no matter how bad it is . One of those movie that is somewhere in between being so bad it 's good and so bad it 's , well , just plain BAD , it 's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it 's both ! Great middle-of-the-night fare , if only for the fabulous tennis drag . Do n't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male , because logic doe not apply .",0
"This movie take the plot behind the sci-fi flick `` Doppelganger '' ( an astronaut from our Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth ' on the opposite side of the Sun , and the Cold War totalitarian vibe on that world ) and try to turn it into a pilot for a TV series . However , the whole thing sank without a trace , and TV is probably better off for it . Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV ' way . Cameron Mitchell turn in his usual solid performance . So doe Glenn Corbett ( who seems to be a kind of poor man 's John Saxon ) who play the rugged individualist whose very existence pose a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order ' on counter Earth . But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set design and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad . I 'll give one example : in the original template for this pilot , ( `` Doppleganger '' ) , the astronaut lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm , and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence ( it wa obvious that their ship wa never going to fly again ) . Then the two astronaut stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rain and wind , only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeaker . In `` Stranded in Space '' , the astronaut are sitting in their seat when buzzer sound , thing start shaking , and the camera blur into a blackout ( and a a friend pointed out , it wa pretty obvious that the actor were simply shaking themselves on their seat , the director wa n't even shaking the camera or the set ) . I 've seen episode of `` The Twilight Zone '' and `` The Outer Limits '' that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity . And that , in essence , is what 's wrong with `` Stranded In Space '' . No budget , no time , no imagination ... just making the token gesture and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys ' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest . Sorry , guy , it did n't work . I 'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away , and never thought of it again , except a a listing on their C.V. And that 's what you , the viewer will do . You 'll remember , if pressed , that you once watched a TV movie called `` Stranded In Space '' , but it made no lasting impression on you , and you ca n't recall too much about it .",0
"Black comedy is n't always an easy sell . Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful , like Fargo , for example . But usually they do n't often find big audience . People seem to either set their mind for comedy , or for serious mayhem . There doe n't seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both . Throw Momma From the Train wa a fairly decent hit , yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age . Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987 . DeVito play an odd mamma 's boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still life with . The mother is played by Anne Ramsey , who passed away shortly after this wa released , and she is quite a caricature . She is loud , ugly , rude , and overbearing . Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself , he want desperately to have his mother offed . He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scene , but he clearly doe n't have the gut to actually do it himself . That 's where Billy Crystal come in . Crystal play Larry Donner , Owen 's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college . Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claim his ex-wife stole his novel and made million off it . He is currently trying to write a new one , but can not even come up with a decent first sentence . `` The night wa .... '' Owen hears Larry wish his ex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria . And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train , Owen decides to travel to Hawai ' i and murder Larry 's ex-wife . Once it appears he ha done so , he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother . The resulting action is often quite funny , and even poignant . It 's certainly never dull and often full of surprise . The acting is exceptional , even if Ramsey wa a bit over the top . Crystal is a good a he can be , and DeVito ha always been undervalued a a performer . The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually work , often painfully so . The film make use of some truly innovative editing technique in some scene , and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing . I have often been critical of the late 1980s a being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making . Throw Momma From the Train take chance . Both in how it character are drawn a well a it general plot . How many comedy revolve around a son having his mother murdered ? The film is n't too long , and it is chock full of laugh . Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public , but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone . 9 of 10 star . The Hound .",1
"Back in 1994 , I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 day off in a row what with two week paid vacation , weekend and the holiday itself . I stayed in town during that time , hanging out at my parent ' house a lot . I did n't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parent ' tube . I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX . I wa hooked instantly . I had always been fascinated with item in our home that had come from my parent ' family home and through inheritance from relative ' estate , and often wondered about their history , value , etc . After my long vacation , I used to go to my folk ' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX . I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series wa filmed wa being renovated and that once said renovation were complete that Personl FX would return to the air . It never did ! Personal FX wa the first -and best - of the collectible show . And it vanished from the air ! Almost fifteen year later , I 'm still sore . Way to go , FX .",1
"Paul Verhoeven 's predecessor to his breakout hit 'Basic Instinct ' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller . Verhoeven ha become known for making somewhat sleazy trash film , both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reason why . The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve ( played by Jeroen Krabbé ) ; a gay , alcoholic and slightly mad writer who go to Vlissingen to give a talk on the story he writes . While there , he meet the seductive Christine Halsslag ( Renée Soutendijk ) who take him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lover and proclaims that he will meet him , even if it kill him . Paul Verhoeven twist the truth many time in this film , and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it . Many of the occurrence in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be , but they could easily be interpreted a something else entirely and this keep the audience on the edge of their seat for the duration , and also make the film work a this narrative is what it thrives on . Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feel he ha to restrain himself , and that is one of thing I like best about him . This film feature a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hour afterwards ( and that doe n't happen very often ! ) . I wont spoil it because it need the surprise element to work ... but you 'll see what I mean when you see the film ( make sure you get the uncut version ! ) . There is also a number of other macabre scene that are le shocking than the one I 've mentioned , but are lovely nonetheless ; a man get eaten by lion , another one ha a pipe sent through his skull , a boat is smashed in half ... lovely . The acting in The Fourth Man is n't anything to write home about , but it 's solid throughout . Jeroen Krabbé hold the audience 's attention and look the part a the drunken writer . It is Renée Soutendijk that impress the most , though , a the femme fatale at the centre of the tale . Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine year later with Basic Instinct , but the original fatale did it best . Paul Verhoeven 's direction is solid throughout a he directs our attention through numerous point of view , all of which help to create the mystery of the story . Verhoeven ha gone on to make some rubbish , but he obviously ha talent and it 's a shame that he doe n't put it to better use . Of all the Verhoeven film I 've seen , this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across ; trust me , it 's worth the effort .",1
"I accept that most 50 's horror are n't scary by today 's standard , but what the hell is this ? When you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast . Instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either want to take over the world or live in peace on Earth .... yeah which is what the people wanted . The overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast .... but the title really kill the movie . Night of the Beast would have made the fan more happy because there really is n't any blood to speak of . I like how the 50 's movie had ending that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one . This movie is n't the worst i 've ever seen but it almost up there . 2 out of 10",0
"Demon Wind is about a much fun a breaking your leg . It is definitely an awful example of a film . So awful in fact that I do n't even consider it a movie . I describe it more a a thing ... a monstrous thing . A thing that must be stopped at all cost . My friend and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tape at my friend 's house . It wa a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movie ( we unfortunately picked this one . ) Well , during the 90 minute that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up . The thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word . It 's just a cheap , poorly done rip-off of Evil Dead . The whole `` story '' seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friend by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demon rip them to piece . I have a bet that the writer were actually writing the story while it wa being filmed . I 've seen bad horror movie before ( Manos , Troll 2 , HOBGOBLINS ! ! ! ) ( shudder ) I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these film on term of sheer stupidity . Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid film . Fun fact : This film is like a cockroach on steroid ! Much like the ouija board , every time we try to get rid of it , it always seems to mysteriously reappear . Kind of scary huh ?",0
"There is a difference between a `` film , '' and a `` movie . '' A film , regardless of quality , is ready for public consumption . A movie is what a group of friend get together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder . In my time a a viewer , I have seen may example of both . On September 19 , I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski 's `` Donnybrook . '' Now having read the script and having seen two different cut ( a rough cut and the `` finished '' product ) of this piece , I can safely say it is a movie . And a student movie , at that . It is , for lack of a better word , competent , which is to say , the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving image . The visuals are , for the most part , static and unimpressive , and dialog scene are reduced to mostly long shot , with little to no close up shot to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the character . I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film , but some visual flair would have been appreciated , and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested . Granted , there have been independent picture that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written , engrossing story and some sharp dialog . Steven Soderbergh 's `` sex , lie , and videotape '' come immediately to mind . This movie , however , ha neither . The main story is weak and unfocused . If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father , then I feel this movie miss the point . What I got out of it is that Davie 's main aspiration is to `` change the face of rock 'n ' roll . '' However , we see very little activity on his part to show this . While there is one dream sequence at the beginning , and an impromptu performance of his at the end , all we seem to get are scene of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar . We are simply told that Davie ha played a lot of gig , but we never see him in full rock out mode . Next time , SHOW do n't TELL the audience . Anyone who ha taken a creative writing class know this . Also , Davie doe n't look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970 's ; he look like he 'd be more comfortable in the early day of rock 'n ' roll , posing a James Dean 's le talented brother . In the meantime , the rest of the movie event seem to happen at random to rather cliché character , and story thread , that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story , are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency ( i.e . the subplot involving Terry 's father ) . If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction , I will consider watching `` Napolean Dynamite '' again , a film I could barely make it through the first time . As for the above mentioned dialog scene , I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between . Is it too much to ask for character who do speak ? I do n't think it is . When the character do speak , it is in short , choppy sentence ; collection of oh so insightful question , angered grunt or wildly over-the-top outburst . These character simply do not behave like normal , rational people . Working with material like this , it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film , Al Hudson 's , and that 's just because he 's doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen . A good director , or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director , would have been able to spot these problem and get the writer and camera people to correct them . However , with Satejowski being so close to the material , he simply doe n't see them , or , if he doe , he is unwilling to take the necessary step to fix them because it 'll hurt his creative vision . Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner , is the mark of a self-indulgent , misguided fool . Just ask Rob Schneider . In the end , we are left with a poor , high-school-set , knock-off of Zach Braff 's amazing `` Garden State '' combined with the equally amazing `` Velvet Goldmine , '' two film far more worthy of your time . Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review , allow me to offer this . The best I can do is compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see . However , the hope that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded vision of grandeur . This is a student movie , nothing more , nothing le . If the movie hold any promise ( and let 's face it , at this point , it is n't going to come from the acting , writing , or directing ) , it is this : If , IF , the people associated with this film are willing , then , please , learn from this movie , file it away , and use the lesson learned on your next attempt ; do n't attack your critic , or have friend or family do it for you . If you are able to do this , maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution , worthy of being called a `` film . '' I am your audience , and I am willing to watch .",0
"please re-watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie , the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest character in the series stretch a badly thought out 25min TV episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life , truly an awful film . tubbs and edward are in it for a few min , micky ha 1 line , and her lipp just reel out the same tired old pun , also mr bris 's accent just change about 5 time in the film ton of badly acted extra , and really a few laugh that they seem to recycle for 2 hr i honestly feel this series ha been completely ruined by this god-awful piece of crap .......... batman and robin all is forgiven",0
"Finally ! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi , Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs . This is a non-documentary , an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girl subtly kicking the 'system ' in it as . It 's all about football and it funny , it really funny . The director say `` The place are real , the event is real , and so are the character and the extra . This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actor , a their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness . '' The non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind . Excellently scripted , the film challenge patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness . It ha won the Jury Grand Prize , Berlin , 2006 . Dear reader , it 's near-perfect . WHERE , where can I get hold of it ?",1
"Sometimes you just have to have patient when watching indie horror . If you can just toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scene , sometimes a real gem will present itself ... This ( unfortunately ) wa not the case with `` Satan 's Whip '' . Written and directed by Jason Maran , `` Satan 's Whip '' attempt to drag u along on a boring snore-fest of a film , with no real pay off at the end . I 'm guessing that the black & white ( and blue ) cinematography must have been for a reason , however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue , and I found this increasingly annoying a the film went on . The story in itself is not that bad , and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic . This , combined with the slow-pacing and lack of any real ( red ) gore made `` Satan 's Whip '' one to forget quite quickly . I will give it a `` 4 '' rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle , but ala that could not save this boring waste of my time .",0
"Tainted look at kibbutz life This film is le a cultural story about a boy 's life in a kibbutz , but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general . In the first two minute of the movie , the milk man in charge of the cow rape one of his calf . And it 's all downhill from there in term of the character representing typical `` kibbutznikim . '' Besides the two main character , a clinically depressed woman and her young son , every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well evil . The story center on how the kibbutz , like some sort of cult , slowly drag the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows . There is no happiness , no joy , no laughter in this kibbutz . Every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny , hypocrisy , violence , cultism , repression etc . For example , while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his `` jewish '' physical appearance and brutish personality . He care more about screwing foreign volunteer than the health of his dying mother . He treat these volunteer like trash . After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he ha n't seen in a long time due to his military service , he order , Quote  `` Linda , go take shower and I cum in two minute . '' There is one other `` good '' character in this movie  a European foreigner who play the mother 's boyfriend . When the animal rapist try to hit the mother 's son , the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist 's arm . He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for `` violent '' behavior against one of the kibbutz member . More hypocrisy : The indescribably annoying French woman who play the school teacher preaches that sex can not happen before age 18 , or without love and give an account of the actual act that 's supposed to be humorous for the audience , but is really just stupid . She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the field who then in turn screw the little boy 's mom when her mental health take a turn for the worse . The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult . Children get yanked out of their bed in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the field overseen by the kibbutz elder . The mother apparently ca n't `` escape '' the kibbutz , although in reality , anyone was/is always free to come and go a they choose . It 's a mystery how the boy 's father died , but you can rest assured , the kibbutz `` drove him to it '' and his surviving parent are another pair of heartless , wretched character that weigh down on the mother and her son . That 's the gist of this movie . One dimensional character , over dramatization , dry performance , and an insidious message that keep trying to hammer itself into the audience 's head  that kibbutz life wa degrading , miserable and even deadly for those who did n't `` fit in . '' I feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz . But I feel a though he took a few kernel of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bomb .",0
"( When will I ever learn- ? ) The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey wa another Citizen Kane . Please allow me to vent my spleen ... I will admit : the setting , presumably New York City , ha never been so downright ugly and unappealing . I am reminded that the 70 's wa a bad decade for men 's fashion and automobile . And all the smoking- ! If the plan wa to cheapen the character , it succeeded . For a film to work ( at least , in my simple estimation ) , there ha to be at least ONE sympathetic character . Only Ned Beaty came close , and I could not wait for him to finish off Nicky . If a stray shot had struck Mikey , well , it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most . I ca n't remember when I detested a film a strongly . I suppose I 'm a rube who doe n't dig `` art '' flick . Oh , well .",0
"`` Lost '' , `` 24 '' , `` Carnivale '' , `` Desperate Housewifes '' ... the list go on and on . These , and a bunch of other high-quality , show prof that we 're in the middle of a golden age in television history . `` Lost '' is pure genius . Incredible layer of personal , and psychologically viable , story , underscored by sublime cinematography ( incredible to use this word , when describing a TV-show ) , a killer score , great performance and editing . Anyone who is n't hooked on this , are missing one of the most important creative expression in television ever . It may have it problem , when watching only one episode a week , but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to watch this . Hope they keep it up ( a I 'm sure they do ) .",1
"Clifton Webb is one of my favorite . However , Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best . His patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny . The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality . In addition , the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed reference to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off a over-reverent rather than genuine . Clifton Webb doe his best with a poor script . Edmund Gwenn play yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do . The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who display a flat affect throughout the entire film . His sole claim to fame a a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age . However , once you 've heard it , you 've heard it and you do n't need to hear it again . Unfortunately , he is in the majority of the film 's scene . I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he show up . Since he ha a lot of scene in this film , this mean that I fast forward through a lot of the film . There were and are so many talented child actor ; it 's a pity this film doe n't have any of them in it . Still , Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and short is a sight worth seeing .",0

"The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the mass ; the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general , but it could just a well stand for any nation of the world . When war finally doe arrive , it 's ravage continue not for another five year , but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed . Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the `` wandering sickness '' , a pestilence that continues for another four year . `` Things to Come '' balance both a fatalistic and futuristic world view , where science hold out a hope for a revived civilization . The `` Wings Over the World '' concept play out a bit corny , though it 's spokesman Cabal ( Raymond Massey ) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause . If he fails , others will follow . This message is continually reinforced throughout the film , brought home convincingly in Massey 's end of movie speech . Man 's insatiable need to test the limit of knowledge and achievement requires an `` all the universe or nothing '' mindset . The film 's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film `` Metropolis '' . As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 , the spectacle of the city 's rebirth strike a resonant chord , a architecture of modern city of today suggest the movie 's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition . Where the movie get it wrong by sixty seven year though is man 's first mission to the moon , but in 1936 , a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 . `` Things to Come '' is one of those rarity in film , a picture that make you think . Which side will you come down on , the force for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo ? It 's not a comfortable question , a both choice offer inherent danger and unknowable outcome . Those who choose to be bystander risk being swept away by force beyond their control .",1
"Fulci ... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movie ever made ? Answer : yes ! Cat in the Brain , also known a Nightmare Concert is Fulci 's last masterpiece . Yes it is , no matter what some people will say about it . There are few fact why this movie is one of the best Fulci 's movie . Fulci make a fun of himself and his movie with this one . Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself , who play ... well horror-splatter-gore director , who think he is slowly going insane . It 's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movie work here . Being Fulci flick , you need to know it 's gory . How much ? Well pretty much . I always loved gore in the movie and I never get enough of it , but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore , and believe me , it 's a hard to archive . Even the Braindead did n't stop it . CITB is all about gore . Almost every scene revolves about Fulci , who after being hypnotized by * khmmm * evil psychiatrist is seeing all kind of horror for everything that happens to him or everything he see . Some of the scene involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey , and instead of that he see rotten corpse lying on the floor , which start to spit some ooze from it 's wound . Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2 , this IS the goriest Fulci movie ! Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic part in the gorefest movie . He is such a brilliant director . Some funny moment and line happens from time to time , like one where Fulci say `` making gore movie is kind of a sickness '' Ending is very good considering that Fulci ( and most of the Italian horror master ) is know for making ending with no sense or many plot hole . If you are fun of the Fulci , make sure you check it out . If you have a weak stomach , avoid this and repeat `` Its only a movie '' p . some of the gore scene within this movie : Chainsaw dismemberment ( full ) , tongue torn out , eyeball torn out , maggot infested corps , zombie , decapitation , face being putted in boiling water , stab in the shower ( to head ) , throat slit , many part of the body and organ being toast aside , hammer smashed face ...",1
"What an incomprehensible mess of a movie . Something about a cop who extract bullet from himself after he get shot and keep them in a glass jar in his bathroom ( and from the size of the jar he 's been shot about fifty time by now ) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldier who for some reason drive it into Mexico . Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear . And you 'll never hear another screenplay feature the word `` butthorn '' either . Gary Busey try out the Mel Gibson role from `` Lethal Weapon '' and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damn the whole movie to mediocrity . William Smith doe another turn a a Russian soldier , the same character he played in `` Red Dawn '' a few year earlier . After playing biker heavy for most of the 70 it wa sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavy . Sadly he 'll probably always be remembered best a the guy who Clint Eastwood whupped in `` Every Which Way You Can . ''",0
I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scene about the raptor . I like raptor because they are scary . My favorite part are the one where the raptor look behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana . I really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphic seem a little fake but it 's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and I think it 's got a good ending even though I did n't really understand what wa going on on my first couple viewing I figured it out over time and that 's the important part . The other important part is how scary the dinosaur can be if you 're watching it the first time . THIS IS BEST MOVIE .,1
"WARNING : REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS A couple of year back I managed to see the first five film in this franchise , and wa planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series . However , just two year on and I find I ca n't remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they could n't have made much of an impression . From what I do recall , some of the sequel  Dream Warriors in particular  were n't a bad a is often made out , though even the original wa no classic . Generally , the predictability of the premise ( if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dream ) doe n't lend itself to narrative tension . But while I can not recall much of the first five film , I do know they never plumbed the depth of Freddy 's Dead . An indication of how sick of Freddy the public wa at this point can be judged by the fact that the film wa promoted solely on the character 's demise . The fact that the movie 's conclusion is not even hidden , but in fact the entire purpose for the film 's being go to illustrate how vacant , soulless and cynical this venture wa . Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester a the charismatic villain , Robert Englund 's in-no-way-scary interpretation boom with laughter . I always thought Freddy 's mockery of the teenage victim wa le aimed at the character than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe . It 's like Englund 's cry out `` we know this is garbage  but you 're paying to see it , so who 's the one laughing ? '' And I 'm sure victim of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight . Was Freddy 's appearance in the film always so rudimentary ? All he get to do here is a few `` haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars '' and that 's it . If this wa the only Elm St. film you 'd ever seen you would n't get to know the character at all . Even a the character pre-death in a flashback Englund play him a a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic ( ie . overstated , misplaced and not at all funny ) irony . Acting is almost universally poor . Just look at how many time Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gesture and body language . Only Kananga himself , Yaphet Kotto , keep his dignity . And when Roseanne , Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up , you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire . The script , too , is absolutely lousy , almost wholly without merit . Carlos ( Ricky Dean Logan ) open a road map , upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy ha wittily written `` you 're f * * ked '' . When prompted for the map , Carlos responds `` well the map say we 're f * * ked '' . Who wrote the screenplay , Oscar Wilde ? Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy , his hearing enhanced to painful level ? So Freddy torment him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound , given that all sound are magnified . Oddly , the fact that Carlos shout at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect . `` Nice hearing from you , Carlos '' , quip Freddy , hoping some better line will come along . It 's also worth noting that dream sleep doe n't occur instaneously , so being knocked unconscious would n't allow instant access into Freddy 's world . Though a part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic is n't that high on the list of requirement . The teenager heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious , dislikeable group in the whole series . Tracy ( Lezlie Deane ) is the only one who get to greet Freddy with `` shut the f * * k up , man '' and a kick in the scallop . And wa incongruous pop music always part of the ingredient ? Freddy 's Dead . No laugh . No scare . No interest . No fun .",0
"Some comment here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III film of the 90 , but although it is undoubtedly brutal , violent and very downbeat , this film from Pou-Soi Cheang is n't really sleazy , lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison . However , it still pack a punch that make it worth a watch , particularly if gritty , hard-edged action is your thing . Edison Chen play Pang , a Cambodian hit-man who travel to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge ; Sam Lee is Wai , the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down , whatever the cost . With Wai closing in on his target , Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meet Yue , a pretty illegal immigrant who need his help to escape her life of abuse . A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography , amazing sound design , a haunting score , and solid performance from Chen and Lee ( a well a newcomer Pei Pei a Pang 's love interest ) , Dog Bite Dog is one for fan of hard-hitting Asian hyper-violence ( think along the line of Chan-wook Park 's Vengeance trilogy ) . Stabbings , shooting , merciless beating : all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang . Of course , this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved , and sure enough , pretty much everyone in this film dy ( rather nasty death ) . Unfortunately , there is a fine line between tragedy and ( unintentional ) comedy , and in it final moment , Dog Bite Dog cross it : in a laughably over-dramatic final scene , Pang and Wai are locked in battle a a pregnant Yue look on . Eventually , after all three have suffered severe stab wound during the fracas , a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on ( a now dead ) Yue , delivering their baby moment before he himself dy . Whilst this film might not be a 'classic ' slice of Hong Kong excess , with it deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals , it 's still worth seeking out .",1
"I watched this movie for the hot guy -- and even he sucked ! He wa the worst one -- well , okay , I have to give prop to that freaky police officer rapist guy too , he wa even worse . The guy wa n't that cute in the end , he had the most terrible accent , and he wa the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that ca n't stand up to his mom for the one he `` love '' there 's ever been . Overall , and if this make any sense to you , when I go to pick up movie at the video store , I think to myself a I read the back of a movie that look so/so , `` Well , at least it ca n't be worse than Carolina Moon . '' The most terrible movie , and the most terrible writing , acting , plot -- everything in it made my gag reflex want to do back flip . It wa THE most horrid movie I will ever see , with Gabriela way up there too . I hated it , and trust me , if there wa any number under 1 IMDb had for rating , I 'd choose that in a heartbeat .",0

"I have decided to not believe what famous movie critic say . Even though this movie did not get the best comment , this movie made my day . It got me thinking . What a false world this is . What do you do when your most loved one deceive you . It 's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake , it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance . Same way some people are such that they are never grateful . This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself . A brother dy inadvertently at the hand of a gangster . The surviving brother decides to take revenge . Through this process , we learn about the futility of this world . Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone . Amitabh gave the performance of his life . The new actor Aryan gave a good performance . The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show . Her role wa small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance . Chawla had really great face expression but her role wa very limited and wa not given a chance to fully express herself . A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi . His movie always give some message to the audience . His movie are like novel of Nanak Singh ( a Punjabi novelist who 's novel always had a purpose and targeted a social evil ) because they have a real message for the audience . They are entertaining a well a lesson-giving .",1

This movie is mader with one thing in mind : To depict brutal murder . Why , then , is not the little girl tortured and murdered a well ? Will this be next for u movie-goers ? The torture and abuse of child ? Whats wrong with you people ? Lynch is truly ha a disgusting , ugly mind .",0
"I ca n't say much about this film . I think it speaks for itself ( a do the current rating on here ) . I rented this about two year ago and I totally regretted it . I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice , but I just could n't . I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever , ever again . And I 'm not one to trash a movie , but I truly believe this wa awful . It wa n't even funny in the slightest . The only bit I enjoyed were the few scene with Christopher Walken in them . I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me . All I can think of when I see one of their film now-a-days is this terrible movie , and it reminds me not to waste my money . Amy Poehler is so very annoying , too . Overall , well , I think you get my point . The star are for Walken , by the way .",0
"I am not so old that I ca n't remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple time . But some where in all his year of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor a well a his brain cell . From the moment this film open you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead . Neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line . Goldthwait obviously hate himself so much that he need to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary character he degrades . If you ever saw Shakes the Clown you know how unfunny Bobcat wa 15 year ago ... this movie is worse . It wa not even funny by accident It is sad , pathetic and a total waste of time . May Goldthwaits ' hand be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script . Strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene .

The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren ( Paul Douglas ) to help Dr. Clint to find the killer that are infected with the plague and inoculate them . `` Panic in the Streets '' discloses a simple story , but it is still effective and with a great villain . The engaging plot ha not become dated after fifty-seven year . Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut , and the camera work while he try to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Pânico na Ruas '' ( `` Panic in the Streets '' )",1

The unrated version tease you in to watching but will completely disappoint you . The acting wa terrible and sound effect just gaudy . It appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building . Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead . I ca n't believe National Lampoon put it name on this .

"There have been many documentary that I have seen in which it appeared that the law wa on the wrong side of the fence - The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first and foremost . But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it . It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco wa at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI , and at the very worst an act of murder . Like most people , when the siege at Waco wa occurring I assumed that David Koresh wa a completely evil madman who wa leading a violent cult . After seeing this , I think that Koresh wa more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the U.S. government through his eccentric action . Sure , there were lot of weapon at the Branch Davidian compound . But none of it wa illegal . It wa absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound , all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless . And it wa angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government force on the Waco site , the clueless testimony of Janet Reno , and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco , a defense led by a few of the committee Democrats . Standing out most in my mind wa NY representative and current U.S. senator from NY Charles Schumer . I voted for the man when I lived in NY state - I 'm a Democrat , pretty left-leaning too . After seeing his action on this committee , I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead ! For anyone remotely interested in the government , this is a very crucial film , a must see . I even think this should be shown in class - it 's that important .",1
"I saw this movie last night and thought it wa decent . It ha it 's moment I guess you would say . Some of the scene with the special ops force were cool , and some of the location shot were very authentic . I wo n't be putting this movie in my DVD collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting . I guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre . The action is good , the acting is decent , the woman are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion , and the story is pretty interesting . 7 out of ten",1
"Yes , I call this a perfect movie . Not one boring second , a fantastic cast of mostly little known actress and actor , a great array of character who are all well defined and who all have understandable motif I could sympathize with , perfect lighting , crisp black and white photography , a fitting soundtrack , an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and work . It 's one of those prime quality picture on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest , the mark everyone should endeavor to reach . Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning . There wa nothing this actress could n't do , and she always went easy on the melodramatic side . No hysterical outburst with this lady - I always thought she wa a better actress than screen goddess like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford , and this movie confirmed my opinion . Always a tough a nail and at the same time conveying true sentiment . It is fair to add that she also got many good part during her long career , and this one is by far the least interesting . The title fit this movie very well . It is about desire , human desire I think everyone can understand . Actually , no one seems to be scheming in this movie , all character act on impulse , everybody want to be happy without hurting anybody else . The sad fact that this more often than not lead to complication make for the dramatic content into which I will not go here . I liked what this movie ha to say about youth , about maturing and about the necessity to compromise . The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt , it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America . The story ha a certain similarity with Fritz Lang 's considerably harsher movie Clash by Night , made one year earlier , where Stanywck star in a similar part . I can also recommend it .",1

"I saw the movie `` Hoot '' and then I immediately decided to comment it . The truth is that NATURE need protection from u because we are the dominant specie of this planet . Some people think that if they have money , they can do whatever they want to , which probably is like , but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful ! This movie is not just about kid , this movie is showing u that the kid are usually the one that care more about it then the adult do . When I wa twelve , I saw some waterlilies and I knew they are protected by law and did n't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law , but fearing that I might harm them actually . ( I am currently 15 ) What so ever , the acting wa great , the 3 main character are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them . I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie ! ! ! and Enjoy !",1
"I had some reservation about this movie , I figured it would be the usual bill of fare -- - a formula movie about Christmas . Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June , we decided to give it a shot anyway , maybe we would see some snow . This movie turned out to be one laugh after another . Ben Affleck wa believable in his character , but the real star of this one is James Gandofini . He delivered his line with a real wit about him and made a great `` dad '' . If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hour , definitely check this one out .",1
"When I first saw this film around 6 month ago , I considered it interesting , but little more . But it stuck with me . That interest grew and grew , and I wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself . I purchased the Criterion DVD box set , and it turn out that I wa right the second time . Alexander Nevsky is a great film . It is rousing , and I 'm sure it succeeded in it main aim : propaganda against the Germans . That is the most common criticism against this film , and against Eisenstein , that it is merely propagandist and nothing else . It 's untrue . He is an amazing film artist , one of the most important whoever lived . By now , the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein 's film a art .",1
"Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy . I first discovered Macy in Fargo and I 've seen a few of his film and he ha n't yet deceived me . Macy is the archetypal `` nice guy with something to hide '' . In Focus , he play the role of Lawrence Newman , a loyal and hard-working stiff , who harbour his handicapped mother at home . The scene is set after World War II , at the height of McCarthyism . Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically , anti-Semite . After he accidentally hire a woman of Jewish descent , he is asked to buy a pair of glass , to improve his failing eyesight . Unbelievably , the simple act of buying glass ha great repercussion on his life and that of Gertrude Hart , his wife ( played by a great Laura Dern ) . As the film unravels , Newman will begin to see a whole different world , where being Jewish is akin to being an animal . The movie is disturbing in the way it show that being racist wa something fairly normal . The chilling thought is that in some place , it probably still is .",1
"In `` Brave New Girl , '' Holly come from a small town in Texas , sings `` The Yellow Rose of Texas '' at a local competition , and get admitted to a prestigious art college in Philadelphia . From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty . I loved this movie . It wa full of great singing and acting and character that kept it moving at a very nice pace . The acting wa , of course , wonderful . Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding , a well a Nick Roth The camera work wa really done well and I wa very pleased with the end ( It seems a sequel could be in the making ) . Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production . Quite a gem in the film archive .",1
"Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign , this flick turn out to be an irritatingly clichéd , sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending . Clue # 1 for all considering seeing this turkey : Sam Raimi did n't direct it . Although commercial for the movie play up his involvement , in truth he is one of four producer . It 's too bad that someone a talented a Raimi ha allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie . I do n't think he would ever have directed something like this ; that task wa left to the Pang Brothers . The screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other `` horror '' film , so you 'll find absolutely zero original content in `` The Messengers . '' What we get are a scene here and there that wa plucked straight out of `` Pulse , '' a couple that could have come from `` The Birds , '' one or two from `` The Others , '' etc . Nearly every scene , almost every line of dialogue , is one that ha been lifted from any number of other movie . The whole thing make for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the `` surprise ending '' long before it come . Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign , centered on the idea that only child can see ghost , ha nothing to do with this movie . In fact , everyone can see the ghost . The teenage daughter and mother character certainly see them , even quite early in the movie . I 'm sure that whomever wa in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal , which otherwise is entirely absent . Now you know , so do n't be fooled ! Perhaps what this movie lack most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actor . It simply is n't there . All of the interaction come across a awkwardly stilted . Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot hole ( just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened , anyhow ? Did n't anyone think to maybe arrest him ? ) , it all add up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shot : loud noise , visual flash , and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling `` Boo ! '' All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirit attempting to warn people away from a house . If there 's any message that `` The Messengers '' delivers , it 's `` Do n't waste your time on this movie . ''",0
"This movie suck as . Something about a heatwave in some European country , complete trash . There 's nothing going for this movie whatsoever . maybe 30 second of sex but that 's it . There is a very annoying chick who hitch ride with people and really piss me off . This movie is complete rash and you should n't subject yourself to watching it . I regret it it 's very boring . I would rate it zero but i ca n't . No body in their right mind should see this . i 'm sure you 'll regret it completely i did . How could they think up something this bad . Even Mystery men wa better . MYSTERY MEN . That suck . That movie wa n't worth being made . complete waste of time . The character in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored .",0
"I wa looking forward to The Guardian , but when I walked into the theater I wa n't really in the mood for it at that particular time . It 's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it , but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it . I 'm not exactly sure what wa dampening my spirit . The trailer looked good , but the water theme wa giving me bad flashback to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld . Plus , despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect , I 'm still not completely sold on him . Something about the guy just annoys me . Probably ha to do with his simian feature . It took approximately two minute for my fear to subside and for my hesitancy to slip away . The movie immediately throw u into the midst of a tense rescue mission , and I wa gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers ' orange face lift . My concern briefly bristled at Kutcher 's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort wa made to paint him a ridiculously cool and rebellious . Sunglasses , a tough guy toothpick in his mouth , and sportin ' a smirk that 'd make George Clooney proud ? Yeah , we get it . I wa totally ready to hate him . But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jab . Darn you , ape man ! Efficiently mixing tense , exciting rescue scene , drama , humor , and solid acting , The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audience will enjoy . You can quibble about it clichés , predictability , and rare moment of overcooked sappiness , but none of that take away from the entertainment value . I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guy , but on the contrary , the training session just might be the most interesting aspect of the film . Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are hero whose story have never really been portrayed on the big screen , so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audience to this under-appreciated group . Do you have what it take to be a rescue swimmer ? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous mission in cold , dark , rough water , and then you must fight disorientation , exhaustion , hypothermia , and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded , panicked people who are depending on you for their survival . And if all that is n't bad enough , sometimes you ca n't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who life and who dy . Man , who want all that responsibility ? Not me ! I had no idea what it wa really like for these guy , and who would have thought I 'd have an Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education ? Not only doe The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero , but lucky for u it also doe a good job of entertaining it paying customer . THE GIST Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it 's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance . I saw it for free , but had I paid I would 've felt I had gotten my money 's worth .",1
"Going into see Seven Pounds i wa n't clearly sure what to think because the preview left to much open to grasp what the movie wa really about . So within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot , have no idea what is going on and you think Tim , who claim to be Ben , is just a big asshole . All of this come to an end when the `` twist '' , so to speak , is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie . Basically Tim ( will smith ) wa troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven people life . By this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turn give his life to . The acting of this film is great , a i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress . Rosario Dawson , to me , this is one of her better movie , aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to . She ha been in some bad some good but she doe deliver in this film . Other actor , such a woody Harrelson , have very small role and not a big enough role to grasp the character . Although the casting of the film wa still good . This movie wa definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped . The movie , however , wa still pretty good . Nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything fall into place . Up until then it just seems like a pointless love story . Final thought seven pounds=seven Stars .",1
"I saw Brother 's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it ! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great a father and son . The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn . He show up there because his brother ha died , and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationship with his brother 's wife and child and his father who ha never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family . The story take u deep into the heart and mind of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their life . Also , the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop set the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait .",1
"`` Mararía '' really disappointed me . I ca n't consider it a a bad movie , but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotion . Dr. Fermín display some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one ca n't really understand where it wa born from . I mean , how many time doe he ever have a conversation with Mararía ? ? Maybe once ? Also , Mararía never appeared to be a real character , instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie ( ... or else another title wa needed ? ) . Some of the best acting came from a role that wa n't really important to the story , that of Marcial , the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard . Of course , the scenery , the cultural tidbit of the Canary Islands , and other `` wow '' moment were interesting , but the movie fell short of a documentary ( in case this wa it real intention ) , and most importantly , a a solid drama .",0
"Serum is about a crazy doctor that find a serum that is supposed to cure all disease through the power of the mind . Instead it creates some kind of monster that need to eat human flesh and brain . The mad doc creates some zombie out of cadaver and ha some problem . There is a very long lead into all the action with many scene getting you acquainted with the character . The mad doctor 's nephew get into a car accident and the mad doc try to use his new serum on the boy . The result are not good . This is a class C film with OK acting but some trouble directing and some continuity error . There is n't much zombie action in this one and the effect , while adequate , are nothing special . You can fast forward through the slow part and get some enjoyment out of the action scene . Watch out for some nudity and bad language .",0

"It 's a unique film , a it give u our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory . Because he seems so reserved & detached he 's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly us all those around him . However in the deadly serious ( no pun intended ) last act , when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman , he 's much le comfortable . But his way with an epigram is peerless , and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gem ( Macarthur , really -- he wa the wit of the pair ) . The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes , but ha little camera movement aside from a storm sequence . Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen . ( NOTE : H & M themselves have blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameo a bum in the flophouse scene ) . The most notable supporting player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott , notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward , who appears a one of the bitchy author always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher Coward . Curious that Woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoon the legendary Algonquin Round Table , of which he wa a founder , and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member . The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story , though that victory is probably due more to Coward 's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot . It 's Coward , Woolcott , and the dialogue you remember ...",1
"This is definitely a `` must see '' film . The excellent Director Alain Chabat ( also acting a Ceasar ) ha managed to capture the very essence of the `` Adventures of Astérix '' ( the French comic book it 's based upon ) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy , which is also an homage to the world of animated film . This movie is so funny , so full of joke ( both visual and spoken ) that it might take you two or three screening before you notice them all , between your burst of laughter . The only drawback is that a non-French audience ( or at least a non-French speaking audience ) might not get all the `` private joke '' . There are so many dialogue impossible to translate , so many situation directly related either to the comic book or to the French way of life , that the fun might be lessened . However , it 's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture , the amazing stunt , the music , the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting . All actor are great , but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze , Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer . And please do n't EVER compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic book : `` Astérix et Obélix Contre César '' and directed by Claude Zidi .",1
"I thought this movie wa stunning , with completely outstanding performance by Valentina Cervi ( Artemisia Gentileschi ) . Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully , with tentative yet confidant mannerism , her hand mapping out an idea before moving her model into place . The passion to which Artemisia give to her art is just spectacular to watch . Although not each character wa overtly beautiful , this made the film more realistic a the facial hair and clothing wa perfect for that point in time . Overall i thought this film wa fantastic .",1
"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movie and a such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling `` Gentleman Jim '' the best boxing movie ever made . That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick `` Somebody Up There Likes Me . '' That movie might be number 1 , but `` Gentleman Jim '' is a close number 2 . The movie doe n't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett , it also show the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition . In the late 1800s boxing wa moving away from the brutal day of bare-knuckle rule to the more `` gentlemanly '' day of the gloved , Marquis of Queensbury rule . And the sport wa moving away from the day when it wa an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability . `` Gentleman Jim '' is not a realistic look at those day . It is romanticized and , yes , even a bit hokey at time . But always delightfully so . Errol Flynn is perfect a the `` Gentleman '' Jim who really is n't a `` gentleman '' at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family . Alexis Smith is quite ravishing a the upper class woman with whom he ha a love/hate relationship ( and we all know it is , of course , love that will win that match in the end ) . At the end of `` Gentleman Jim '' the great John L Sullivan ( whose famous line wa NOT `` I can lick any man in the world '' of course ... romanticism again ) hand over his belt to Corbett . This is truly one of the best scene in any sport move ever made . Realistic ? No . But wonderful . Hey , if you want realism watch `` Raging Bull '' instead . That is a much more realistic boxing movie . But `` Gentleman Jim '' is a lot more fun .",1
"That this movie ha been stapled to the wall of a chapel a proof that God is truly dead . Am I the only one that really saw ( rather sleptwalked ) through this `` film '' ? This is the only movie I 've ever seen in the theater that I regret not walking out on and demanding my money back -- it wa just that dull . And I even saw `` Highlander 2 : The Quickening '' at the local cinema . From beginning to end , Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry a two unlikelies , cast together by circumstance , who eventually work together a best buddy . The action ( what little there is ) is goofy and a dull a the skullbone of the writer .

"Well , there 's no real plot to speak of , it 's just an excuse to show some scene of extreme violence and gratuitous sex ( which can sometimes be fun , too , but it 's not in this case ) . What else can I say about this ... ? The action , when happening , is inventive and there 's a cool scene where two character are falling from a skyscraper ( one that ha to be several mile high ) , but overall there 's not much to recommend `` Kite '' .

"This is the best film the Derek couple ha ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you have n't seen any of the others . There are the usual ingredient : it is just a poorly acted a their other effort , we can watch Bo disrobing or auditioning for wet T-shirt contest quite frequently , the story is just laughably idiotic , and the film take itself much too seriously . And then : Orang Utans in Africa ? But it ha a few thing going for it . Bo look great , the production value ( set , costume , etc . ) are quite good , and this greatly enhances it camp value . In a strange way it is actually quite funny , simply because it try to be serious and fails so badly .",0
"Some people drift through life , moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye ; others latch on to a cause , another person or a principle and remain adamant , committed to whatever it is -- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it . But we 're all different , ` Made of different clay , ' a one of the character in this film put it , which is what make life so interesting . Some people are just plain crazy , though -- and maybe that 's the way you have to be to live among the mass . Who know ? Who know what it take to make thing -- life -- work ? Writer/director Lisa Krueger take a shot at it , using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed -- and how one ` get ' committed -- and obsession , in ` Committed , ' starring Heather Graham a a young woman who is adamant , committed , obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy , too . Her name is Joline , and this is her story . Admittedly , Joline ha always been a committed person ; in work , relationship , in life in general . She 's a woman of her word who stick by it no matter what . And when she marries Carl ( Luke Wilson ) , it 's forever . The only problem is , someone forgot to tell Carl -- and 597 day into the marriage , he 's gone ; off to ` find ' himself and figure it all out . When Joline realizes he 's not coming back , she refuse to give up on him , or their marriage . Maybe it 's because of that ` clay ' she 's made of . Regardless , she leaf their home in New York City and set off to find him , which she doe -- in El Paso , Texas , of all place . But once she know where he is , she keep her distance , giving him his ` space ' and not even letting him know she 's there . She considers Carl a being in a ` spiritual coma , ' and it 's her job to keep a ` spiritual vigil ' over him until he come to his sens . And while she watch and wait , her life is anything but dull , a she encounter a young woman named Carmen ( Patricia Velazquez ) , a waitress at one of the local eatery ; Carmen 's ` Grampy , ' ( Alfonso Arau ) , who is something of a mystic ; T-Bo ( Mark Ruffalo ) , a truck driver who ha issue concerning Carl ; and Neil ( Goran Visnjic ) an artist who make pinata and take a fancy to her . For Joline , it 's a journey of discovery , during which she learns a lot about Carl , but even more about herself . There 's a touch of humor , a touch of romance , and some insight into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot . And Krueger present it all extremely well , delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining . Her character are very real people , with all the want , need and imperfection that make up the human condition ; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tell her story . We see it from Joline 's point-of-view , a Krueger make u privy to Joline 's thought and therefore her motivation , which put a decided perspective on the event a they unfold . That , along with the deliberate pace she set that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates , make for a very effective piece of storytelling . There 's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter , but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrate instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situation that Joline encounter . And the result is a well textured , affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life . Heather Graham take hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation . She immerses herself in the part and give a performance that is convincing and believable , adding the little personal trait and nuance that make all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person , and one that is real . And for this film to work , it wa imperative that Joline be viable and believable -- and Graham succeeds on all front . Her screen presence ha never been more alluring , and her vibrant personality or even just the way she us her eye , is enough to draw you in entirely . it 's all a part of the character she creates ; there 's an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance , who she is inside and out . She 's a likable , agreeable person , and because you 've shared her innermost thought , you know who she is . It 's a good job all the way around , beginning with the way the character wa written , to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life . As Carmen , Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging , a well . Her performance is very natural and straightforward , and she us her instinct to effectively create her character . She ha a charismatic presence , but is le than flamboyant , and it give her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth . She is refreshingly open and up-front ; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back , but is totally honest on all front , and that , too , is part of her appeal . And , a with Joline , this character is well written , and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life . Overall , there is a number of notable performance that are the heart and soul of this film , including those of Luke Wilson , Casey Affleck ( a Joline 's brother , Jay ) , Goran Visnjic , Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo a T-Bo , who , with very little actual screen time , manages to create a memorable character . The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens ( Jenny ) , Clea Du Vall ( Mimi ) , Summer Phoenix ( Meg ) , Art Alexakis ( New York Car Thief ) , Dylan Baker ( Carl 's Editor ) , and Mary Kay Place ( Psychiatrist ) . A film that say something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture -- reflecting upon who we are , where we 're going and what we really need -- ` Committed ' is an enjoyable experience ; a ride definitely worth taking . 8/10 .",1

"I wa looking forward to this so much , being a big fan of the book . However , when it came out I remember thinking it wa one of the biggest waste of money and time I 've ever spent at the cinema . In principle , the acting , the set and the music were excellent , and are the main reason why I 'm rating this a 4 . In this version , Sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste . There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her punishing the other girl ; in the book she make a point of describing lie a `` not just wicked , but vulgar . '' There 's also far too much of a Disneyfied ending for me ; Sara 's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the Indian sunset . While the book doe have a happy ( and critic might say equally improbable ) ending , it doe n't leave you thinking , `` Oh puh-leeze . '' About the only thing true to the book were : 1 . Sara 's father being a soldier 2 . The line between Sara and her father ( `` Are you learning me by heart ? '' / '' No . I know you by heart . You are inside my heart . '' ) 3 . Sara 's friendship with Becky , and her 'adopting ' Lottie ( although this last one wa n't developed a much a it could have been ) 4 . The changing of her room by adding various luxury item . That part wa brilliantly done . 5 . The basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there , but that 's about all that is . People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience . Possibly . All I can say to that is I have two cousin - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fan of this film until they read the book . If all you want is a 'feel-good ' family film , then this delivers . If you 're looking for a film that actually tell the story of A Little Princess ( in fact , if you 've read the book ) do n't waste time with this one . It 's such a shame ; with a cast like this , if they 'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic . Am I harping on about 'read the book ' this and 'read the book ' that a little too much ? Very probably . But if someone attempt to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie , then they should at least have done the same thing . Preferably more than once .",0

But after second viewing you will start to join the piece together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be . A word of advice for slasher flick fan stay away from this movie . This is not your dumb as teenage slasher movie , in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b * * b and lot of blood . If you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that support Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch , without any of your ill mannered friend that crack joke on a really tense situation . And do n't forget to switch the light off . My point on different aspect : - Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 Total = 9/10",1
"Ken Burns ' `` Baseball '' is a decent documentary ... it present a clear origin of the game , a great depiction of baseball 's early year and hero . There 's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan ... that said , the film ha several glaring flaw . 18 hour is simply too long for the human attention span . It 's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his `` nine inning '' concept . It 's not even a tight 18 hour ... the pace on every segment is slow , almost morose ... the music always nostalgic and wistful . Is n't baseball ever exciting and fun ? Why is every player and their accomplishment presented in the form of a tragedy ? Talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak , yakking about baseball a a metaphor , baseball a Americana , the psychology and theology of baseball ... enough ! This is syrupy , mawkish drivel . Billy Crystal is here to sell u all the Yankee hokum he 's sold u before . Ken Burns us the National Anthem a the series ' theme song , and manages to play `` Take Me Out To The Ballgame '' so many time you might vomit . We get it , dude . Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal , so he spends probably a third of the film on the Negro league ... these segment are spent chastising white of yesterday for not being a open-minded a Kenny is today . For shame ! He chides baseball for being segregated in the thirty and forty but fails to realize that America wa segregated in those time ! Burns fall head over heel in love with Buck O'Neil , a former negro-league player , and drool over every piece of footage in which the elderly O'Neil wax poetic about his playing day . Nonsense ... Burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down . `` Baseball '' wind up a mushy , gushy , civil-rights propaganda disguised a Americana . Its clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise he would know we watch game laughing and cheering , not weeping and reciting soliloquy ... are you listening , Mr. Burns ? There 's no cry in baseball .",0
"`` Quitting '' may be a much about exiting a pre-ordained identity a about drug withdrawal . As a rural guy coming to Beijing , class and success must have struck this young artist face on a an appeal to separate from his root and far surpass his peasant parent ' acting success . Troubles arise , however , when the new man is too new , when it demand too big a departure from family , history , nature , and personal identity . The ensuing split , and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other . Hongshen slip into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim . But what an exceptionally convincing particularity , honesty , and sensuousness director Zhang Yang , and his actor , bring to this journey . No clichés , no stereotype , no rigid gender role , no requisite sex , romance or violence scene , no requisite street language and , to boot , no assumed money to float character act and whim . Hongshen Jia is in his mid-twenties . He 's a talented actor , impressionable , vain , idealistic , and perhaps emotionally starved . The perfect recipe for his enablers . Soon he 's the `` cool '' actor , idolized by youth . `` He wa hot in the early ninety . '' `` He always had to be the most fashionable . '' He need extreme , and go in for heavy metal , adopts earring and a scarf . His acting mean the art , friend -- and role , But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input . And his self-criticism , dulled by the immediacy of success , open the door to an irrational self-doubt , self-hatred -- `` I did n't know how to act '' `` I felt like a phony '' -- and to readily available drug to counter them . He say `` I had to get high to do what director wanted . '' So , his shallow identity a an actor becomes , via drug , an escape from identity . Hongshen 's disengagement from drug and his false life is very gradual , intermittent -- and doggedly his own . Solitude , space , meditative thinking , speech refusal , replace therapy . The abstract is out . And a great deal of his change occurs outdoors -- -not in idealized location but mainly on green patch under the freeway , bridge , and high-rise of Beijing . The physicality is almost romantic , but is not . The bike ride to Ritan Park , the long spontaneous walk , the drenching sun and rain , grassy picnic , the sky pattern and kite that absorb his musing are very specific . He drift in order to arrive , all the while picking up cue to a more real and realistic identity . `` I started to open up '' he say of this period in retrospect . And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which project a kind of dancer 's positioning ( clumsy , graceful , humorous , telling ) in a current circumstance . If mind or spirit is lacking , his leg can compel him to walk all night . Central to his comeback is the rejection of set role . To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity , he smash his video and TV , and bang his head till bloody against his `` John Lennon Forever '' poster . He ha let down his iconic anti-establishment artist -- -but he 's the only viable guide he know . He even imago himself a John 's son ( Yoko Ono ) , and adopts his `` Mother Mary '' a an intercessor in his `` hour of darkness '' and `` time of trouble . '' ( the wrenching , shaking pain in the park -- hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeal ) `` Music is so much more real than acting '' he say . And speaks of Lennon 's influence a `` showing me a new way . '' In the mental institute , the life-saving apple ( resistance , nourishment ) reflect Lennon 's presence , a doe Hongshen 's need to re-hang his hero 's poster in his redecorated room . If Lennon 's influence is spiriting , Hongshen 's father 's influence is grounding . Although father and son are both actor and user ( drug and drink ) , it is Fegsen 's difference from his son that underwrites his change . For the father is more secure in himself : he accepts that he 's Chinese , a peasant in a line of peasant , a rural theater director . And he exercise control over both his habit and his emotion . It 's this recognizable identity that drive Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board , sometimes with anger and rage , sometimes with humor ( the blue jean , Beatles ) and passivity . In his most crazed , and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar , and a fake , he expose more of himself than his father : `` all the act I acted before were bullshit ... life is bullshit . '' And to Hongshen 's emphatic `` you are NOT my father , '' he softly reply , `` why ca n't a peasant be your father ? '' Under these two teacher and with much additional help from his mother , sister , friend , inmate at the rehab inst. , he make some tangible connection to a real ( not whole ) self . As the long term drug effect recede , so doe his old identity . Indebtedness replaces pride , trust distrust . Integrity banishes his black cloud . All his edge soften . `` You are just a human being '' he repeat endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine . Back home , lard peasant soap is fine with him now . And his once `` rare and true friendship '' begin again a is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy . Hongshen say of this movie : `` it 's a good chance to think about my life . '' And I might add , become a New Actor , one bound to art and life . Like Lennon , he ha gained success without a loss of identity .",1
"I have watched this movie countless time , and never failed to be charmed by it 's homely simplicity , sincerity and goodness . Great characterization by all of the cast , and the lovely little steam train that play a such an important supporting role.I confess I fell in love with Roberta in 1970 , and she still touch me today . Shown on TV in New Zealand on Christmas day , the nicest present I could have had .",1
"If only I had read the review by Alex Sander ( sic ) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public I would not have seen this desecration . Alien wa a fantastic , dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi . Predator wa a great sci-fi/action mess-about . I do really have only myself to blame though a I saw 'Alien versus Predator ' . It too ha an average grading of over 6 star from the connoisseur of film that frequent this site . STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS EVER SO SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT BEING RUINED FOR YOU . Right from the beginning this film wa ridiculous . No explanation wa offered for the Predator ship overrun/not overrun by Aliens . OK so maybe they were again going to throw alien down to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an Alien/Predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology ? The start wa actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who wa who or what wa what and perhaps why . From then on it get really ridiculous . I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out . I could n't here . A father and son are hunting in the wood . The damaged ship crash land to ( from the view given ) I would calculate at the very least 10 odd mile away through thick woodland . The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged . Even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face hugger are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and action and the father seems like such an irresponsible , dumb redneck muppet . An edgy , thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless , dull now cop friend from the bus . When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actor and no feeling is played out . A slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who get beaten up by the over protective , crazy , nasty Jock type ( American sportsman not a Scottish man ) . Oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con 's brother by the way . Yes they 're clever these director brother whose name I will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again . Then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at PC , Ripley credential type character introduction come with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child . Guess what happens next ? I wo n't tell you much more about the actual ( smile sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent film ) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the Alien-ridden universe . The Predator is stupid for the reason stated by the previous poster whose post I read too late . The Aliens are boring . The Predator-Alien is ridiculous . The action is at time exploitative , gratuitous , disgusting nonsense . The hospital scene with the pregnant mother ? ! ? ! Oh I wa shocked alright . Shocked at how low some people will go to get what ? A scare ? Some shock ? To titillate the perverse ? What ? If you really wanted to shock , titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting father or who have no soul why not just have the Alien/Predator shagging the saucy woman and teenage girl rather than killing them ? The character have no depth and neither doe the plot . It 's filmed and paced badly . It 's acted by disinterested people not that I can blame them . It further tarnish two rather interesting and good set of sci-fi character . This film wa rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it I really have to worry about you . If you have n't seen it then well please make your own decision . PS Did I even mention the way that trained soldier are all killed in about 20 second while amateur civilian survive throughout ?",0
"Even though I saw this film when I wa very young , I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who famously escaped from Newgate prison . Apart from the liberty taken right at the end , the film more or le faithfully follows the true story . The temptation to bend the fact which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical film is resisted in this film and the film maker must be praised for that . Of the performance , There is scarcely a poor performance , and Tommy Steele is ideally cast . Also good is Stanley Baker a the Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good a always . Because the film stick to the fact , it make it suitable to be watched by all the family .",1
"Gone is the wonderful campiness of the original . In place is a c-grade action no-brainer , wich is not all bad , but pale in comparison to the original . All the meaningless sex and violence is gone , and replaced with crappy joke and unexplained plot pointer . See it , but do n't expect the thrill of the first .",0
"Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars , Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work -- particularly in the 1940s-1950s -- ranging from drama to quirky comedy . I particularly love his comedy , a they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen -- far different from the usual fare from Hollywood . This being said , this wa the film that sparked my interest in these movie . It 's plot wa so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere -- except for Ealing Studios -- which had a particular fondness for `` little '' film like this one . Guinness is a nerdy little scientist that work for a textile company . He want to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible , though he is not working for the company a a researcher but for janitorial work ! So , he tends to sneak into lab ( either during the day if no one suspect or at night ) and try his hand at inventing . Repeatedly , he is caught ( such a after he blew up the lab ) and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds ! Then , despite the importance of the discovery , he set off a completely unanticipated chain of event -- and then the fun begin . The film is a wonderful satire that poke fun at industry , union , the government and people in general .",1
"Victor McLaglen 's performance is one of the finest in film history . I think we can all feel for `` Gypo '' because we 've all struggled with what is right and what is n't and been wrong . This wa one of the first art-house picture to be released by a major American movie studio ( RKO Radio Pictures ) . Joseph H. August 's cinematography is at it very best here . However , August 's stunning portion wa mostly overlooked ; he did n't receive the Oscar nomination he rightly deserved . This is a psychological drama , with thought , philosophy , sadness , all conveyed with a little word a possible .",1
"How do you take a cast of experienced , well-known actor , and put together such a stupid movie ? Nimrod Antel ha the answer : Armored . Six co-worker at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves . But , just a they get to first base with their plan , everything unravels quickly . With a plot like this , you 'd think it could n't be too bad , at least for an action movie . However , in the first 40 minute or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal , everyday kind of guy . They joke , they laugh , have a few drink together , etc . Then , we suddenly learn they 're planning to rob their own business . The hero Ty , ( Columbus Short ) , is sucked into the scheme because of the cold , cruel world , even though he 's a decorated veteran , nice guy , and reliable employee . Oh my , oh my ! Then in the last 40 minute of the film , these former regular guy nearly all turn into money-crazed psycho , willing to butcher each other for cash . In the last scene Mike , ( Matt Dillon ) , go on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend . The viewer ha no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty . It 's utterly unbelievable and `` B movie '' is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot . I would say do n't waste your time -- too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne , Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture .",0
"The sexploitation movie era of the late sixty and early seventy began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream film and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn . It 's peak year were between 1968 and 1972 . One of the most loved and talented actress of the era wa Monica Gayle , who had a small but fanatic cult of follower . She wa actually able to act , unlike many who filled the lead role of these flick , and her subsequent credit proved it . And her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career wa taking off only heightens her mystique . Gary Graver , the director , wa also a talent ; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre , and his skill , combined with Monica Gayle 's screen presence , make Sandra , the Making of a Woman , a pleasantly enjoyable experience . The film never drag and you wo n't have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button .",1
"What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be . This is the type of film that I 've been looking for age .

Chris Rock is not showing a good act here , you ca n't get the feeling that his caracter is real , I think the movie would have been a bit better if it 's drama or romantic scene would have been a le part of the movie and more/better humor wa involved . The movie is like the film maker were having a bad hangover making it . In the `` making of '' they do n't show a single smile . This is a very bad film ! I gave it three out of ten because of few smile it gave me , but I did never laugh !",0

"Flynn , known mostly for his swashbuckling role ( and his bedroom antic ! ) take a different tack with this film and it work beautifully . Playing real-life boxing champ Jim Corbett , Flynn turn on the charm full blast a he make his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist , all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith . He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with score of other men ( and a dog ! ) including a prominent judge . The next day , he get a chance , via Smith , to gain entrance to the judge 's private club . He us this opportunity to weasel his way into the good grace of it exclusive member and land a spot a the club 's resident boxer . His unusually adept skill in the sport soon ha him taking on all comer , up to and including the world champion John L. Sullivan ( Bond . ) Flynn is downright magical here . He is the epitome of charm , charisma and appeal in this role . He look terrific ( especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit ) and doe virtually all of his own stuntwork ( impressively ! ) His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally . Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn . At this stage , he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advance and reputation ( he wa undergoing statutory rape charge at the time ) and she doe so admirably . She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude , yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell . Bond is incredibly burly , brawny and towering , yet tender when the script call for it . Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson . Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self a Flynn 's manager . The rest of the cast is excellent a well including Flynn 's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill type . The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed . A few of the set are amazingly presented . Some of Smith 's gown border on the garish , but she suit the upswept hairstyle very well . It 's a terrific glimpse into the earliest day of championship boxing , but it 's also so much more . Some of it ( like the character trait shown by Flynn ) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purpose , but a lot of it is authentic ( like the method and costume shown in the fight scene . ) One line is particularly memorable : `` I believe you like me more than I like you , but it 's entirely possible that I love you more than you love me . '' It 's classic romantic dialogue ( and there are more than a few zinger sprinkled throughout the script a well . )",1
"Often laugh out loud funny play on sex , family , and the class in Beverly Hills milk more laugh out of the zip code than it 's seen since the day of Granny and Jed Clampett . Plot center on two chauffers who 've bet on which one of them can bed his employer ( both single or soon to be single lady , quite sexy -- Bisset and Woronov ) first . If Manuel win , his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses , he must play bottom man to his friend ! Lots of raunchy dialogue , fairly sick physical humour , etc . But a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface . Bartel is memorable a a very sensual oder member of the family who end up taking his sexy , teenaged niece on a year long `` missionary trip '' to Africa . Hilarious fun .",1
"Thought provoking , humbling depiction of the human tragedy of war . A small , but altruistic view of one family 's interaction with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky . This movie lessens the `` glamor '' of war ; showing it 's effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit . A lot of today 's movie show war a an opportunity to highlight the `` hero 's '' and other glamorous feature of war , but very little attempt to show the true effect war actually take on a community . This movie attempt this through a retelling of a person 's memory of those day . This movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual event , when in reality , this movie is probably a factual reality of hundred , perhaps thousand of `` actual event '' during the civil war . I highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie .",1

"I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it wa wonderful , especially since it wa based on a true man . Pierce Brosnan wa very good a the loner English man who took on the persona of the half breed Grey Owl . The photography wa beautiful . This movie made me do more research into this character Archie Belaney known simple a Grey Owl . I want to read a much a I can about him . At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it . But I am not surprised . I like all his movie whether he is acting or directing . I gave it the highest rating . However , I would have liked to have seen more in the movie about WHY he took on this persona a it only showed the two aunt who raised him and his room in their house . You ca n't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effect every few minute .",1
"Despite having an absolutely horrid script ( more about that later ) , this film is still vaguely watchable just because it star two excellent actor , Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda . Aside from one or two REAL stinker , I 'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film , a I am a huge fan of Hollywood 's golden age of the 1930s and 40 . However , no matter how much I love their film , I just ca n't recommend this film . The movie begin with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort . The two have n't yet met , but the film begin loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly yodel while skiing . It wa done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but I stuck it out -- especially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling ! ! In hindsight , perhaps I should have just turned it off then ! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara go for help . Back at the ski lodge , he seems okay but fortunately she is ALSO a doctor and ha him x-rayed and nurse him back to health . He , in turn , becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her . Despite hardly knowing each other , they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy . Once home , however , all is n't rosy a she jump right back into her job a a family doctor and he begin exhibiting sign that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy . The film play it all for laugh , but frankly Fonda 's behavior were really creepy -- spying on her and her male patient , attacking or threatening ANY man she treat , tripping a patient who already ha a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there ( men and woman ) are out to steal away his wife . He come off a a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic , but it 's all supposed to be for laugh . Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut , you would think that Stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order ! But , oddly , she get mad but just ca n't stay mad at Fonda because he 's so ........ ? I ca n't think of the right word -- 'creepy ' is all that come to mind ! ! ! Later , out of the blue , multi-millionaire Fonda get a job working the counter at a department store . Then , through magical thinking , he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past -- so a job apparently cure anger and suspicion . When this job fall through , the film end with Fonda buying his own hospital , giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after . They do n't go any further with the story , but I assume based on Fonda 's character that he then spent most of his time a hospital administrator beating up all the male patient . The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT fit well together , nor did the final `` Horatio Alger '' inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world . They were like three separate plot but despite this , the most serious problem with the film wa it seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy ! What a creepy little film ! Thank goodness neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely film .",0
I find the critique of many IMDb user a little harsh and in many case find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that want to sit and watch something just to GET AWAY from it all . In this case however I have to say it wa BAD . I am a SciFi junkie and there wa NOTHING in this movie that grabbed me for even one second . There wa no proper storyline . I may be an idiot but I still do not know where the GOVERNMENT wa that wa so worried about these piece . The pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 piece is scary . Half the time the two piece were already in place and he simply had to add the third . A 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together . This movie wa BAD . Dominic,0
"I wa debating between this movie and 2012 but chose Inglourious Basterds due to it 's amazingly high IMDb rating . I must say now , what a disappointment . I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence , but I also expected a lot of witty dialog . I got a huge dosage of the former , but not nearly enough of the latter . I felt shortchanged . The ratio between violence to plot is very important and I think this movie get it totally wrong . And the plot ? It 's that believable or really all that entertaining either . Save your time and money . I ca n't believe what this rating say for the gory and violent taste of the modern mass .",0

"Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz . A young mother Selma Lidz ( Andie MacDowell ) is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid ( John Tururro ) is a little lacking in the emotion department . Unhappy with the new home situation , their sensitive son Steven ( Nathan Watt ) decides he want to stay with his two eccentric uncle Danny ( Michael Richards ) and Melvin ( Lou Cutell ) until his mom is well . Steven seems to be happier and even take interest in his strange uncle 's living habit ; he even decides he want to change his name to Franz . Set in the early 60 's , this drama is a bit comedic ... change that to zany . Not being a MacDowell fan , UNSTRUNG HEROES assures my attitude ; albeit I enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste .",0
"Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movie is Otto Preminger 's 'Where the Sidewalks Ends , ' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry ' by Frank Rosenberg ... Dana Andrews is the honest , tough New York policeman , always in trouble with his superior because he like his own strong-arm method a much a he detests crook ... When he hit someone , his knuckle hurt ... And the man he want to hit is a smooth villain ( Gary Merrill ) who point up the title . 'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter ? ' he asks Andrews . ' I have a much right on the sidewalk a you . ' Dana Andrew 's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden , painful discovery that he is the son of a thief ... His deep hatred of criminal led him to use their own illegal method to destroy them , and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta ... By a twist of irony unique to the film itself , Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura ' are united once more , and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few year later , but no longer the romantic , beaten down by his job , by the cheap crook ... This time , he go too far , and accidentally kill a suspect ... The killing is accidental , the victim worthless , yet it is a crime that he know can break him or send him to jail ... Using his knowledge of police procedure , he cover up his part in the crime , plant false clue , and try to implicate a gang leader , but can not avoid investigating the case himself ... The double tension of following the larger case through to it conclusion without implicating himself in the murder , is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical , satisfying , and in no way a compromise ... The film is one of the best detective film of the 50 's , with curious moral value , also one of Preminger 's best ... Preminger us a powerful storytelling technique , projecting pretentious camera angle and peculiar touch of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism ...",1
"In sum , overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese ha hole ! The director and co-writer say he wanted to mix genre - in this case drama and comedy . Well , at least here , these two mix like vinegar and oil . To boot , the comedy is not very funny and juvenile . Additionally , the film is not really realistic . Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drug in French Hospitals . I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on . Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main character make to his ex-lover 's son . By that time I wa worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deal with a dead lover , marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover . At time the plot diverts to the family of the two main character and then reverts back to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora . To the detriment of the audience , viewpoint keep changing from Nora and Ismael , her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital . There probably are two potentially interesting film here neither of which are well developed . The epilogue doe not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstance in real life the chance are equivalent to a snow ball 's chance in hell . The actor do their best and are appealing , but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring fault of poor writing , editing and lack of focus .",0
"Incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperor who went insane , leaving infamous party orgy and ruthless killing in his path ... I know there are several version of this , and this is based on the 102 min ' one that I watched - but I ca n't fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck ! I 'd heard for long about the alleged `` shocking '' content of sex/nudity ( which honestly there is n't much of here at all - and boring when there is ) and blood , but beware - it 's the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shock here : Everything look plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project ! Camera-work is hopelessly inept , full of strange zoom , failed framing and confusing pan ( to and from what mostly look like a huge theater stage ! ) complete with a grainy , cheapish photo quality . Lighting and color scheme are terrible and uneven - is it day or night ? Are they in- or outside ? Have they changed scene ? Who is , or is meant to be in the shot ? Editing is the final sin here , making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaway , continuity flaw and random transition that destroy any chance of momentum , story progression - and involvement . There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story ... but these fault distract so much it 's tragic . A story with SO many possibility to be great is just one gargantuan , burnt ( and Fellini-like ) turkey that 's only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O'Toole , who make a most memorable Tiberius . Oh yes , which brings u to the big-name actor . I 'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask : Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgy to be a part of this ? There , I 've wasted enough line on one of the truly worst film of all time - period ! 1 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",0
"Did anyone edit this film ? Or wa it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gap between scene ? It 's OK though , I fell asleep watching it the first time . Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time . The plot is actually not the worst I 've seen , but it 's close . The acting is not the worst I 've seen either ... but it 's close . The production .... well , I can honestly say that it wa the worst I had ever seen in my life ! Not trying to be spiteful , but Unhinged could have used some more production . Please do n't think I 'm a hater of horror film , or even that I did n't enjoy this film . I just felt I wa laughing at the film much more than I felt I wa laughing along with it . The gruesome moment were not too poorly done , but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget . Characters seemed awkwardly developed , or ignored all together , twist ending wa pretty bad , and the exposition took forever without exposing much . I 'd recommend avoiding this movie . 1/10",0
"Riding high on the success of `` Rebel Without a Cause '' , came a tidal wave of 'teen ' movie . Arguably this is one of the best . A very young McArthur excels here a the not really too troubled teen . The story concentrate more on perception of delinquency , than any traumatic occurrence . The supporting cast is memorable , Frankenheimer directs like an old pro . Just a story of a young man that find others take his action much too seriously .",1
"Most of the comment on this movie are positive so I thought I would try and redress the balance . I came out of this movie wondering what wa going on . I now know and still consider it to be a poor movie . I intially discounted a dream sequence a that seemed too obvious . I wa glad that I had a free ticket to the movie or I would have asked for my money back . Movie reviewer and critic love this movie , which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film . The 8+ rating this movie ha is so misleading . In 20 year time this film will not compare to true great such a The Godfather . The film doe have fine performance from both the lead but that is n't enough to save the film . ( nor are the lesbian scene ! )",0
"Pepe le Moko , played by Charles Boyer , is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in country throughout Europe , and to stay free he hole himself up in the Casbah , a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go , until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all . For le Moko , although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody , it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he ca n't leave , because the moment he doe , he know he 'll be arrested . Boyer 's performance wa good , and I can understand why he wa nominated for an Oscar . He capture the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time . The movie itself , unfortunately , wa quite a letdown . A number of part of the story seemed inconsistent , of which I 'll mention two . First wa the idea that the police would n't enter the Casbah . That wa stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander , and yet repeated reference in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly . So , neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police would n't enter , nor the statement by Inspector Slimane ( also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia ) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense . I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he wa - could be so quickly swept off his foot by Gaby ( Hedy Lamarr ) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love song and then leaf the Casbah to find her , essentially giving himself up . I understand the irony of the final few scene , of course , a Pepe leaf the freedom of his prison ( the Casbah ) only to find real freedom in his capture ( because he 's shot and killed by the police . ) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap . This is worth watching for Boyer , and to a lesser extent Calleia , but the story is disappointing and inconsistent . 3/10",0
"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly is n't a perfect movie , but I 'm pretty sure it wa never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell , meaning it work a kind of a summary of his entire career : slapstick , sarcasm , cheese , action , and happy ending . Campbell is , a a writer , uneven -- there are lot of thing in the story that do n't make a great deal of sense ( why doe the robot suddenly have breast merely because a female brain ha been implanted into it ? ) , and some of the scene feel like retread of other , better incarnation ( the scene in the restaurant , where Yegor and William battle for control of William 's body , is straight out of Evil Dead II ) . There are , however , lot of little touch and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant , such a when William is in the height of his panic and scream at a statue , `` What are you looking at ? ! '' The movie look like a Sci-Fi Channel original , probably because it wa . The acting is actually pretty good . I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski a Tatoya ; she wa ruthless and cunning , yes , but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moment that the story never explored . Ted Raimi handled the standard `` bumbling assistant '' role admirably enough , and Bruce is funny a the arrogant , sardonic , condescending American jerk . ( Now that he 's writing his own film , you 'd think he 'd give himself a role that he ha n't been typecast in already . ) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre , nonsensical B-movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously .",1
"You should never ever even consider to watch this movie ! It is absolutely awful ! This is n't an overstatement ! ! It is so unbelievable and exaggerated , it get boring . It is just a movie where they have taken story and plot from several movie and put it together in one . They writer ha n't been able to pull it off in a good way . If you 'd like to see pretty girl in bikini and no brain this might be the movie for you , but still , you should plug your ear and just watch . It 's not worth listening : p There are so many great movie out there , and if I could choose one , this would be the last movie I would pick . But all in all , it 's your choice ! ! ! Enjoy !",0
"Tell the truth I ’ m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people , which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie . And after having seen it , I wa really a disappointed , and this come from the guy that love this genre of movie . I ’ m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid ’ s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little child cursing and swearing . I ’ m not at all righteous but this ha really gone too far in my account . Synopsis : The story about two guy got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior . There they met up with one kid with boob obsession and the other is a medieval freak . Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all . They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done . The story is very predictable ( though expected ) and the humor is lame . And haven ’ t we already seen the same character ( play by Mc Lovin ’ ) in so many other movie ( like Sasquatch Gang ? ) . I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep . Well the casting wa alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay . And the acting is so-so a expected when you ’ re watching this type of movie . And the direction , what do one expect ? This is the same guy who brought u Wet Hot American Summer , and that movie also suck . But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie . Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time . Only the naked scene seem to be the best part in the movie . Can ’ t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone . Pros : Elizabeth Bank ? Two topless scene . Cons : Not funny , dreadful story , nudity and kid do not mix together . Rating : 3.5/10 ( Grade : F )",0
"This film held my interest enough to watch it several time . The plot ha hole , but the lead performer make it work . Catherine Mary Stewart ( Julia Kerbridge ) , doe a great job a a woman of 37 who ha sacrificed everything else to become a physician . She worked year to earn the money to go to medical school . She is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream . Meanwhile , Julia 's sister and brother-in-law are murdered and a the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece Amanda ( Arlen Aguayo-Stewart ) to avoid having her become a ward of the state . Amanda is about 7 year old from her appearance . Amanda is so traumatized from her parent 's murder that she ha become mute . Needless to say , Julia 's 16-hour day get longer caring for Amanda . Rob Lowe play Kevin Finney , a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who work his way into the life of Julia and Amanda . He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress . Amanda really start to warm up to Kevin a the film progress , perhaps more than to her aunt . Julia start to rely on Kevin to take some of the load of caring for Amanda a she attempt to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination . Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia . The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary wa great . You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film . The chemistry between Rob and Arlen wa good a well . Arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of word . The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up to each other . You can see them working out a relationship a the film progress . We discover that Julia 's sister and brother-in-law ( the Meyers ) were involved in industrial espionage . They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer . They had three associate who intended to share the proceeds of the theft . Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identity . The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associate or were themselves double crossed . In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associate . The killer make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them . The killer search the home and fail to find their prize . They leave a living witness to their crime , Amanda . The killer then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempt to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is located . Eventually , the killer kidnap Amanda in hope she know something about the microchip 's location . Eventually Julia discovers the truth about Kevin . He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip . After some rough moment in the relationship they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guy . The predictable ending ha the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together . What struck me about the plot were major hole . Kevin move into the same apartment building a Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of the Meyers . How doe he know that the microchip is not already in the hand of the killer ? The killer blithely leave fingerprint at the murder scene , with no concern for concealing their identity . The killer that pretend to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnant of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe sol . He wa not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film . There are other weakness along these line too numerous to mention . The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming . Filling in the plot hole would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort .",1
"Like the previous poster , I am from northern Vermont , and I wa inclined to like this film . However , not since `` Red Zone Cuba '' have I seen such a confusing plot . The thing the people to bootleg make no sense . Two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car . Uhm , why ? Then they meet two others , and drive up at night in to the bad guy 's hideout in a luxury Packard . -- Would n't just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense ? Then , parked outside the garage that hold the targeted hooch , the four fall asleep ! When they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out , of course they 're spotted and shot at , losing some of their precious cargo in the process . Then two of the smuggler put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border . Again , why ? I am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area , all one needed wa to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the U.S. Canada Border Patrol , which back then had a fraction of the resource it ha now . And do n't get me started on the last half hour , which made no sense whatsoever . The only good thing I can say about the film is that Kris Kristopherson ha actually grown some charisma with the year .",0
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS . This movie wa the worst movie ever . I could n't even watch it all it wa so bad . This film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot . This wa worse than terror toon which at least terror toon wa funny at time . Not even the gore in the film wa good . The shooting were fake and the acting wa worse . Please do yourself a favor and skip this one . If you see it at the rental store then run the other way . There is nothing good about this film at all . If you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch Night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head . If you want to see an OK new cheesy movie then watch Scarecrow . I rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10 . That 's how horrible this film really is . THE WORST MOVIE EVER .,0
"Watched this last night and wa bowled over by the heartfelt story line , the excellent character development , and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie a a whole . Without giving away too much of the plot , it begin with an ordinary joe who commute to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lesson . Along the way the protagonist and the assorted character he meet in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lesson about others and about themselves . The story ha a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically , so it is n't exactly a simple to learn to dance in Japan a it is here in the U.S . The film is lighthearted ; you 'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gag . Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe . All of the film 's character are taken seriously , a they are , and none are diminished because of their `` imperfection . '' I 've been thinking about taking social dance class with some friend . It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance . Is this synchronous or what ? I think so because now I 'm really geeked to give it a try . Watch this wonderful family film ( small child might not get it , but teen certainly would ) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again . Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery , a it is perfect as-is .",1
"Recap : Something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signal is discovered in the ice of Antarctica . The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica . Julian Rome , a former SETI-worker , is brought in to decipher the message . Problem is that one of the researcher is a old girlfriend of his , and the situation quickly turn awkward , especially since the other female researcher practically throw themselves at him . And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly . Soon the object is in the open . The mystery continues though a the object generates a huge amount of electricity . It is decided to open the object , but just before that is done , Julian decodes the signal . `` Do not open '' . But too late , and the object explodes a it is finally breached , and two thing unleashed on earth . The first is an alien , that had been dormant in the object , and the other is a virus that instantly kill the research staff . And Washington , that is suspiciously updated on this historic event , decides that those thing can not be unleashed upon the earth . So a Russian nuclear submarine , carrying nuclear weapon is sent to Antarctica . Comments : The movie hold a few surprise . One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly put in a good acting performance , and the other is that the special effect that are beautiful , well worked through and a lot better than expected . Unfortunately the story hold a lot of surprise of it own , and this time not in a good way . Actually it is so full of plot hole that sometimes the movie seem to consist of almost randomly connected scene . It is never really explained why Washington know so much , why Washington is able to command Russian submarine , why the object is in the Antarctic and ha woken up now . It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English . Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language ( and obviously chose English , why ? ) . But then it is very confusing why the nice alien that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus , send their `` Do not open '' message encoded ! And finally the end is a open a an end can be . The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy ( from me ) must be diverted to fill in the void in the plot . Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good . 3/10",0
"This movie feature Charlie Spradling dancing in a strip club . Beyond that , it feature a truly bad script with dull , unrealistic dialogue . That it got a many positive vote suggests some people may be joking .",0
"Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix , I 'd have a couple of hour of my life back . I 'm frankly suspicious when I see that a film 's director also wrote it . In this case , according to the credit , the same guy wa `` writter and director '' - unfortunately , an indication of the overall quality of this production . There were a few interesting moment ( e.g. , Judy Tenuta 's scene reminded of her early comedy routine touting Judy-ism ) which led me to rate this two star rather than one . Those moment , however , were few and far between ... and I almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence wa nearly incomprehensible to me , not to mention reprehensible in it violence . I admit I went back to watch that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out once I 'd seen the whole thing . Nope , though I at least recognized who the character were who would turn out to be important later . The `` spinning camera '' technique wa overused and essentially pointless . I found myself talking to the TV screen : `` What ? ! ? '' or `` For goodness sake , get ON with it ! '' Not recommended .",0
"The endless bound of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me . This truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling , well-documented and enraging . As an American , I am constantly humiliated by my country 's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement . We suck . This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I 've seen , but it immediately made me want to see what else he 's done . My only complaint , and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10 , is that Pilger show u this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK government , demand that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction ... but make no suggestion of how to help . I do n't know about Britain , but America 's made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government 's doings . A gesture in the right direction might help these islander ' cause .",1
"This flick is so bad it beyond belief.Even for an independent low budget film ... it just , well , sucks.I ca n't even believe even Troma would put out such crap.I have been a fan of some Troma flick for year ( Toxic Avenger , Squeeze Play , Rockabilly Vampire to name a few ) .But LLoyd , come on , this go way beyond the boundary of any taste.It feature some of the worst acting imaginable.I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been a good ... oh , wait , that is what they did.I mean it , these character have negative charisma.With any luck , the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity.As will the special effect people.But beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effect , the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears.The script is full of plot hole the size of Alaska , and there are severe continuity problems.The worst part however , is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way.And this is the most unforgivable sin in film making.But , do n't take my word for it.Go out and waste four buck renting it.Just do n't say I did n't warn you .",0
"This is a very memorable spaghetti western . It ha a great storyline , interesting character , and some very good acting , especially from Rosalba Neri . Her role a the evil villainess in this film is truly classic . She steal every scene she is in , and express so much with her face and eye , even when she 's not speaking . Her performance is very believable . She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there 's anything wrong with being over the top ) . Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too . The music score is excellent , and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for day after seeing the movie , whether you want it to or not . There are a couple of part that are very amusing . I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undress in front of the parrot . There 's also lot of slick gun-play that 's very well done . I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 star if it wa n't for two thing . The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minute into the film . This is one of the most ridiculous looking fight I have ever seen in a movie . It is very poorly choreographed , and look more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight . One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy , but this is a more serious western , and the brawl really needed to be more realistic . The other thing that annoyed me about this movie wa Yuma 's cowardly Mexican sidekick . I guess he wa supposed to be comic relief or something , but the character wa just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this , and he wa n't at all funny . All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him ? All that having been said , let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the fault I have mentioned , and all fan of the genre need to see this movie .",1
"The plot : Michael Linnett Connors ha done everything in film but direct , and is looking for his 1st big chance . He discovers Molly in a play and at once know she will be a big film star . He sign her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct . The producer agrees and their big time career are under way . What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movie with great emphasis on comedy . And , oh yes , there 's romance , and a little sadness too . The performance by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch . The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tune heard . Lots of DVD extra a well in this restored version released in 2008 . It must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st , not just a tribute to silent film . Later year would bring similar film such a , Singin ' in the Rain ( 1952 ) & Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner 's , The Comic ( 1969 ) . What is special about this film , though , is recreating silent movie in 1939 . We see portion of them a the cinema audience would in that bygone era ( although some sound effect are included ) in glorious b & w , while the rest of the movie is in pristine color . One of the greatest in the silent era , Buster Keaton , who at this point wa on an uphill climb , is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scene and he is on the top of his game ! It is said that he had some input on his scene a well . But the real reason to watch the movie , if your a motion picture history fan , is that beyond everything else , Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett 's film legacy . It doe n't take a genius to realize this movie is a `` positive '' reworking of Mack Sennett 's and Mabel Normand 's life . The character Michael `` Linnett '' Connors is Mack Sennett , whose real name wa Michael Sinnott . And Molly , of course is Mabel . Sennett had the pie throwings , the bathing beauty and Keystone Cops . He worked with Buster Keaton , Ben Turpin ( cameo ) , Roscoe `` Fatty '' Arbuckle ( body double ) and fell in love with his leading lady . Not only all that , but Sennett wa technical adviser for this film and appears in it a well . As most film viewer today prefer sound feature , those who were associated with short subject and silents are left out to pasture . As Mack Sennett fell into that category , it is fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade ! Sennett wa of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movie . His career started in 1908 a an actor , then writer , director & producer . He semi retired in 1935 with about 500 film to his credit . He had worked with the best , such a Charlie Chaplin , Gloria Swanson , Bing Crosby , W.C. Fields , Keaton , Harry Langdon , Arbuckle , and even Roy Rogers ( in Way Up Thar ) .As film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career , Mack played it wise & did only selective work for the next 25 year . In 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category , and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work . In the 1940 's his presence wa still felt , e.g . Here Come the Co-Eds ( 1945 ) where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Mack 's Wandering Willies ( 1926 ) is done . In 1947 , The Road to Hollywood , used some of Sennett 's Crosby film . 2 year later brought some nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated . With his knack of always associating with the right people , a guest role with the eternally popular Lawrence Welk & his radio show came about later in the year . 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph , Tillie 's Punctured Romance ( 1914 ) with sound . In 1952 he wa honored on TV 's , This Is Your Life , then his autobiography , The King of Comedy ( 1954 ) , which is a great companion piece to Hollywood Cavalcade , wa published . 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello , a he had a cameo in A & C Meet the Keystone Kops . Finally in 1957 , another tribute with the compilation film , The Golden Age of Comedy . So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer . In the film at the banquet scene the camera pan over the guest at a long table . As we get to the silver haired Mack , he alone turn his head to the camera a if to say , `` here I am ! '' . When he rise to give a speech a short while later , he is at his most subdued , underplaying the word given him a if to mentally convey , `` I know my influence on comedy will never end , but will people forget Mack Sennett the individual . Maybe this movie will help . ''",1
"It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it wa for any woman to get involved with any Cartwright men . After all Ben Cartwright wa three time a widower with a son by each marriage . And any woman who got involved with Adam , Hoss , and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we could n't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three son that started this classic TV western . Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writer would have had revolving woman character who came in and out of the life of the Cartwrights . People have relationship , some go good , some not so good , it 's just life . And we 're le demanding of our hero today so if a relationship with one of them go south we do n't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor 's nobility intact . But that 's if Bonanza were done today . But we were still expecting a lot from our western hero and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped , the secret of Bonanza 's success wa the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart son . Ben Cartwright wa THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name . His whole life wa spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three child . The kid were all different in personality , but all came together in a pinch . The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution . I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys . Just the popularity that Bonanza ha in syndication testifies to that . Pernell Roberts a oldest son Adam wa written out of the show . Rumor ha it he did n't care for the noble Cartwright character which he felt bordered on sanctimonious . Perhaps if it were done now , he 'd have liked it better in the way I describe . This wa just the beginning for Michael Landon , how many people get three hit TV show to their credit . Landon also ha Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control . Little Joe wa the youngest , most hot headed , but the most romantic of the Cartwrights . When Roberts left . the show kept going with the two younger son , but when big Dan Blocker left , the heart went out of Bonanza . Other character had been added on by that time , David Canary , Tim Matheson , and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel . But big , loyal , but a little thick Hoss wa easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights . His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family . So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history . I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City . It doe n't look anything like what you see in Bonanza . But near Lake Tahoe , just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credit , is the Cartwright home , the set maintained and open a a tourist attraction . Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fan , the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real . And if they were n't real , they should have been .",1
"Years ago , when DARLING LILI played on TV , it wa always the pan and scan version , which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in it proper widescreen format . So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus , I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all . Boy , what a terrible film . It 's so bad and on so many level that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it go so horribly wrong . Looking at it now , it 's obvious to any fan of movie that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other director had struck gold with Andrews in musical ( MARY POPPINS , SOUND OF MUSIC , THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE , etc ) but also because Andrews wa snubbed from starring in project made famous on stage by Julie herself ( CAMELOT , MY FAIR LADY , etc ) because Hollywood thought she wa n't sexy or glamorous enough . So Blake created this stillborn effort , to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical . DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personality , never knowing who or what it is . Some specific scene are good or effective but a a whole , it just doe n't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing . Mind you , the version on the DVD is the `` director 's cut '' , or in this case , `` let 's salvage whatever we can '' from this notorious box office flop . In releasing the DVD , Edwards cut 19 scene ( 19 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version . The film move along with no idea of what it is . We are 25 minute into it and we still do n't know what 's going on or why we 're watching what 's going . What kind of spy is Lili ? How powerful is she ? Was she ever responsible for someone 's death ? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews . Things are n't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love . Why doe Julie fall for Hudson ? Why him and not other men she got involved with ? There should have been one of her ex hanging around , trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret . This would have given u some much needed contrast to the muddled action . It would also have given u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding . There 's no catalyst in this story . One only ha to look at the cut scene to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with idea inspired by Andrews ' ( and Edwards ' ) previous success . The best ( or worst ) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of child who sing in the middle of a forest . Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC . It 's no wonder he removed it from the DVD . Back in 1970 , that scene might have worked on a certain level but today , that moment reek of desperation . There are other plot element directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other film . The endless scene of dogfight is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE . The musical moment `` I 'll give you three guess '' wa created just to make fun of Julie 's MARY POPPINS persona , which is turned `` raunchy '' with Julie doing a striptease in the act . The ending , bird 's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson 's plane , is another `` wink '' at SOUND OF MUSIC . The whole thing is confusing . Julie play a singer , born from a German father and British mother , who life in England but sings her ( English ) song in Paris . You never know exactly where the story take place . Some moment are just badly edited . Like when Julie and her `` uncle '' are on horseback . They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprint off in mid-sentence . I 'm like `` what happened here ? '' The comedy bit are unfunny and cringe-worthy . Every scene with the French police are pathetic . Where 's Peter Sellers when you really need him . The action is stupid beyond belief . When Julie and her `` uncle '' are on their way to Germany on that train , Hudson 's squadron shoot round of bullet at the train , almost killing Lili in the process . Brilliant . What 's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning . That 's one slow moving train there . The musical moment . The beginning is the best part of the entire film ( and the reason I gave this film 3 star ) but it 's effect is diminished considerably because it 's repeated at the end . Speaking of redundant , did we really need to see a can-can dance , Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too ? The `` Girl in no man 's land '' is OK even if it 's bleeding obvious , but that moment just doe n't make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldier at a French hospital , making me wonder : how many soldier there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying ? The whole project is listless and without energy . The romance is 100 % unbelievable . Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking ( check out the museum scene ) . Julie look dazed , like she 's on Valium . But what really kill this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy . Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor wa a good career decision . As much a I like Julie , she 's no Greta Garbo , who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI . Funny enough , even if Julie play a German spy , she still come across a cloying and cute . How bad is DARLING LILI ? Even after 37 year since it release , Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for it DVD release .",0
"This series , made for Televisión Española ( TVE ) is basically a series of chapter in the life of an ordinary family in 1968 , primarily a seen through the eye of the youngest son . Based on a background of historical event , such a the May 1968 student uprising in France , the decaying Franco regime , the war in Viet-Nam , the rise of imperialism , and others specifically related to Spanish life at that particular moment , one might regard this series a a simple compilation of characteristic foible which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment . Generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moment which might be called dramatic , the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those time , a , it should be stated , anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happening or is busily occupied in other thing . The best thing that can be said of this series is Ana Duato 's rôle a mother of three child : she play the part of the total housewife of the time really well , manifesting that peculiar Spanish penchant , especially noticeable among woman , of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart , without any resorting to the use of the brain . As we say in Spain , common sense is one of the least common sens . Imanol Arias offer very little , apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman a in other television series . Indeed , a an actor , he should not be trusted in anything which is not a TV series . His resource are too limited ; however , his part a father of the working-class household is not at all bad . Not really recommendable for other audience , even Spanish-speakers in Latin America : the theme are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary Spanish history , such that if the viewer wa not living here at that time he will miss most of the reference . It is even probable that certain situation which cause a few Spanish smile would not mean anything to other viewer .",0
"I want the 99 minute of my life back that wa wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie . The acting wa horrific ! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio . I will never look at them the same again . Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise . Everyone know they never could act . Thankfully , only Dan attempted an accent . His accent wa a disaster a expected . I think he wa either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from Minnesota . I hope this review help anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time . The only reason I wa able to sit through the whole movie wa because I wa stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read .",0
"One of my favorite movie which ha been overlooked by too many movie goer , an observation which mystifies me . Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee , it had many young actor who were to become major star , e.g. , Tobey Maguire ( before Spiderman ) , Skeet Ulrich ( before Jericho ) , Jonathan Rhys Meyers ( before Tudors ) , James Caviezel , Simon Baker , Mark Ruffalo , Jeffrey Wright , Tom Wilkinson , and Jewel . All of the acting wa superb and each of the actor mentioned gave memorable performance , especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing . When the biography and accomplishment of the director ( even when he won an academy award ) and the actor are listed , this film is usually omitted from their past performance . I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched film . However , it is seldom every seen on cable . I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reason this film is not well known .",1
"It 's nice to see a romantic comedy that doe not have the prissy man lead , this ha solid acting from both male lead and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it . I think the story wa a little rushed at the end , but extending that would have made the story even longer . Superior to other romantic comedy such a 100 day with Mr arrogant , and possibly tied with my tutor friend . It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema , not a great a My sassy girl , but still good .",1
"Of all the movie of the seventy , none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle a did the Sentinel . I mean , yes , there were movie like the Exorcist , and other one ; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one . If you have time , check this one out . You may not be able to get past the dated device a such , but this is a story worth getting into.Then there are all the star and soon-to-be star . My absolute favorite were Eli Wallach , Sylvia Miles , and Burgess Meredith . Then there are the subtle clue that lead to what 's going on too . Pay close attention . I had to watch it four time to catch on to all the smaller weird statement like 'black and white cat , black and white cake ' . Plus , the book are really good a well . I 'm just sorry that they 're not going to turn the second book into a film . It 's so scary that it would outdo this movie .",1
"This is apparently the second remake of this film , having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 . And , in so many way it reminds me of the later film , A YANK AT OXFORD . Both film concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top school in the world and both , ultimately , show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency . In this film , William Haines is `` Tom Brown '' and his main rival , `` Bob '' is played by Frances X. Bushman . And , in a supporting role is Jack Pickford -- always remembered a the brother of Mary . Of these three , Pickford come off the best , a the sympathetic loser who becomes Tom 's pal -- he actually ha a few decent scene a well a a dramatic moment just before the Big Game ! All the standard clichés are there and the movie , because it wa done so many time before and since , offer few surprise . However , it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing . In my opinion , for a better silent college film , try Harold Lloyd 's THE FRESHMAN -- it 's football scene are frankly more exciting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown . THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from the era . Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again ( such a in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET , among others ) -- and if you 've seen one of these film , you 've seen them all . Well made , but certainly NOT original ! And , because it is just a rehash of his other film , anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other film . 4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film wa the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920 ! ! Talk about over-rated ! There are dozen and dozen of better film -- how this film got to be # 1 is anyone 's guess .",1
"This movie illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that 's holding it back . Awesome talent , outstanding performance ( particularly by Victoria Hill ) , but a let down in practically every other way . An `` adaptation '' of sort , it brought nothing new to Macbeth ( no , setting it in present-day Australia is not enough ) , and essentially , completely failed to justify it existence , apart from ( let 's face it , completely unnecessarily ) paying homage to the original work . If there 's one body of work that ha been done ( and done and done and done ) , it 's Shakespeare 's . So any adaptation , if it 's not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise , need to at least bring some new interpretation to the work . And that 's what this Macbeth fails to do . As it wa done , this film ha no contemporary relevance whatsoever . It 's the same piece that we have seen countless ( too many ! ) time before . Except with gun and in different outfit . Apart from the fundamental blunder ( no other way to put it ) of keeping the original Shakespearian dialogue , one of the more cringeful moment of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end , during which I completely tuned out , even though I wa looking at the screen . I never thought I had a short attention span , but there you go . I suppose the movie succeeds on it own , very limited term . But a Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent , it movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited term , and actually set high enough standard to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with . A shame . An absolute shame .",0
"Owen love his Mamma ... only he 'd love her better six foot under in this dark , laugh-out-loud comedy that both star and is directed by Danny DeVito , with admirable assist from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role . `` Throw Momma From The Train '' is a terrific comedy , even if it is n't a great film . It 's too shallow in part , and the ending feel le organic than tacked on . But it 's a gut-splitting ride most of the way , with Crystal and DeVito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic take on the essence of being a struggling writer ( DeVito is avid but untalented ; Crystal is blocked and bitter ) . Crystal 's Professor Donner belief his ex-wife stole his book ( the unfortunately titled `` Hot Fire '' ) and ca n't write more than the opening line of his next book , which doe n't come easy . He teach a creative writing class of budding mediocrity , including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy-type fiction but doe n't know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through ; and an upholstery salesman who want to write the story of his life . Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs-per-minutes-on-screen , an ascot-wearing weirdo who see literature a an excuse to write his opus : `` 100 Girls I 'd Like To Pork . '' Then there 's DeVito 's Owen Lift , who call himself Professor Donner 's `` star pupil '' even though the teacher wo n't read his work in class . Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie , a man-child in his late 30 who life with his overbearing mother , Anne Ramsey , who call him `` lardass '' and other endearing sentiment . In any other movie , we 'd be asked to feel sorry for Owen , but `` Throw Momma From The Train '' pile life 's cruelty onto this sad sack for laugh and expects u to go along . That 's one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people . For those of u who enjoy the humor of this character , even identifying with him , and take the rest of what we see here a a lark , it 's not a big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy take , asking u to watch in amusement while Owen enlists Professor Donner 's help in a plan to kill his mother . Actually , he first go to Hawaii to kill Donner 's hated ex , then tell the professor it 's his turn to kill Mrs . Lift , `` swapping murder '' a seen in Hitchcock 's `` Strangers On A Train . '' As a director , DeVito not only complement his actor ' performance with scene-setting that place the accent on dialogue , he make some bold visual statement , throwing in bit of amusing unreality to keep the audience on it toe ( and away from taking thing too seriously . ) Also helping matter is writer Stu Silver , who keep the laugh coming with his quotable patter . `` You got rat the size of Oldsmobiles here . '' `` She 's not a woman ... She 's the Terminator . '' `` One little murder and I 'm Jack the Ripper . '' Those are all Crystal 's word , but some of the funniest line , which work only in context but absolutely kill , are DeVito 's and Ramsey 's . Apparently Silver never wrote another screenplay after this , according to the IMDb , and that 's a shame , because he had real talent for it . The best scene in this movie , when Crystal meet Ramsey , wa actually used in it entirety a a theatrical 'coming attraction ' presentation , the only time I 've seen a movie promoted that way . Owen introduces the professor to his mother a 'Cousin Patty , ' and when Momma say he doe n't have a Cousin Patty , panicky Owen loses it . 'You lied to me , ' he yell out , slamming the professor 's forehead with a pan . Of course , in reality the professor would n't groan out something witty from the floor , but 'Throw Momma From The Train ' work effectively at such moment , when playing it Looney Tunes vibe for all it worth . DeVito ha n't disappeared from film , of course , but it 's a mystery why he ha n't really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie . Maybe it 's because , a 'Throw Momma From The Train 's lack of mainstream success show , his kind of vision is n't to everyone 's taste . That 's too bad for those of u who can watch this over and over , and like it .",1

"Filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they 're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves . This film is set in Glasgow ( although only a couple of secondary character have anything approaching a Scottish accent ) . The premise , about people who 's life are going nowhere , who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hour of the morning a they have night job , COULD have made for a really funny , insightful , quirky , cultish film . Instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which ha been so done to bit I 'm suprised it ha n't been banned . X and Y are friend . X is sleeping with Z. Y sleep with Z a well . Oh you figure it out . A total waste of time . Painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year old would have written for a GCSE drama project . The female character wa completely superfluous - just written in a a token female in the hope that woman would be cajoled into seeing it . If you 're the sort of thicko lad who laugh at beer advert and can usually be found wandering round in pack shouting on Saturday night in nondescript town centre then you will love this film and find it `` a right laff '' . Everyone else , run , do n't walk away from this sorry little misfit . And one question , when the group left the `` boring '' seaside town ( Saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film ) , to go back to Glasgow , WHY did they do it via the Forton motorway service at LANCASTER which is in England ?",0
"Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare film that is completely under the radar , but is totally worthwhile . It really reminds me of the old serial from the 30 and 40 . Which is why I 'd have loved to see follow-up movie ... but judging by the rest of Full Moon 's output there simply were n't enough tit to satisfy the typical audience . Unfortunately , thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate , because without em ' this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kid would have eaten up . Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wa n't sure if Ms. Nipar had n't wandered off an A-list picture onto this film , she wa very believable . No , seriously ! Anyway - it 's a shame they did n't have the buck to license Dr . Strange , because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom .",1
"A truly muddled incomprehensible mess . Most thing in the film look more or le like 1987 , but then there are futuristic thing just thrown in , like the policeman 's ray gun . And that car !

This one is worth missing . Grade : F",0
"It doe n't happen very often , but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference . George Crile 's 2003 best seller , CHARLIE WILSON 'S WAR , is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely `` difference maker '' imaginable . A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas , `` Good Time Charlie '' wa known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation . Likable and licentious ( even for a politician ) , Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folk of Lufkin only really wanted two thing , their gun and to be left alone . It 's Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauty known , appropriately enough , a Charlie 's Angels . When asked why his entire office staff wa composed of attractive , young aide his response is a classic , `` You can teach 'em to type , but you ca n't teach 'em to grow tit . '' No argument there . But even the most rakish rapscallion ha a conscience lurking somewhere underneath , and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocity being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter , humiliating defeat of the Russian military and , possibly , to even help hasten the end of the Cold War a a result . Fat chance , huh ? Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart , snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin , CHARLIE WILSON 'S WAR is a sparkling , sophisticated satire that chronicle the behind-the- scene machination of three colorful character comprising `` Charlie 's Team . '' The on-screen `` Team , '' is composed of three marvelous actor with four ( 4 ) Academy Awards and nine ( 9 ) nomination between them . Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid , slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in year . He 's aided , abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring , a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still-slinky Julia Roberts . Hey , why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this ? By all account Ms. Roberts look good and hold her own , but the screenplay never give u even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character . Maybe the two Afghan hound usually by her side know -- but we a an audience never do . As for the third member of the `` Team , '' Philip Seymour Hoffman steal every scene he appears in a Gust Aurakotos , a smart , street- wise ( i.e . non Ivy League graduate ) CIA malcontent who know the score -- both in the Agency 's boardroom and in Wilson 's bedroom . For the Mujahideen to succeed , the most important assistance the U.S. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships which rule the sky . This take money , lot of money , and eventually `` Charlie 's Team '' covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of $ 1 billion dollar for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebel . This includes top-of-the-line , state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rocket a well a other highly sophisticated killing device . Nasty , nasty stuff . That this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and doe take place behind Congressional door is truly alarming . Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the wall of our very own government . Oh momma , I wish it were n't so ... Even though the initial outcome for `` Team Charlie '' wa an unqualified success , the unimaginable , unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapon are now used against our troop by the Taliban and others . Since the funding wa entirely `` covert , '' the young generation in this part of the world ha no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity wa the direct result of American intervention . Yes , once the Russkies left , so did our aid -- zip for school , zip for infrastructure , zip on maintaining meaningful relationship with the Afghan people . As a result , the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it 's like the forerunner to `` Mission Accomplished . '' As Nichol 's film so pointedly point out , `` The ball you 've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you 've lost interest in it . '' Mike Krzyzewski know this , Eva Longoria Parker know this , little Lateesha in Lafayette know this , but the typical American politician doe n't . So we go from good guy to bad guy because we could n't let the world know we were the good guy . Talk about a Catch-22 ( another Mike Nichols film ) . Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best , `` We f & % ked up the end game . '' Again .",1
"I 'm a big fan of surrealist art , but this film by Bunuel ( with some idea from Dali ) left me cold . Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly way . This is one of the silliest ; almost like what you 'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class . The last few minute of the movie , which have nothing to do with anything else , are a final nose-thumbing at religion . If you read the `` scholar '' regarding this slow-paced , occasionally amusing film , it 's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression . If that is indeed the point , then Bunuel express it in the most roundabout fashion possible . The central male character is a nasty brute who love kicking dog and knocking blind men down in the street , and who mentally turn billboard ad into strange sexual fantasy . Is this behavior the church 's fault ( for interrupting his lovemaking ) , or is he just a jerk ? I vote for the latter . I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics a the one to blame . There are a few moment where you might cry , `` Aha ! surrealism ! `` : a cow in a bed , a giraffe falling out a window ( a poor model ) , a man shredding a feather pillow , a woman flushing a toilet while we watch picture of seething lava ( or a mud pit ... hard to tell in B/W ) . The rest is forgettable self-indulgence . Unfortunately , Bunuel wa still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career ( Viridiana , Discreet Charm ... ) . If you 're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen , check out Jean Cocteau 's early work .",0
"This ludicrous film offer the standard 1970 's `` hippie mentality '' in a nut shell and bore u in the process . Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriage of young , innocent woman with old age sex fiend and wash ups . A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hike and sleep with all the wrong guy , and then one day she meet the ridiculous ( Holden ) , already in old age , hard liquor drinking and washed up a an actor , and she decides that she is in `` love '' with him . If you think that is superficial , the whole film encapsulates such scene . She keep saying how much she `` love '' him and she only met him , it wear thin and really quick . I could n't help but laugh throughout the film . Its obvious she 's just using him a a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place . A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex , I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit . A corny offering of music from the 70 's is also spread through the film . Avoid this if you can . Grade D .",0
"This film wa pretty good . I am not too big a fan of baseball , but this is a movie that wa made to help understand the meaning of love , determination , heart , etc . Danny Glover , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Brenda Fricker , Christopher Lloyd , Tony Danza , and Milton Davis Jr. are brought in with a variety of talented actor and understanding of the sport . The plot wa believable , and I love the message . William Dear and the guy put together a great movie . Most sport film revolve around true story or event , and they often do not work well . But this film hit a 10 on the perfectness scale , even though there were a few minor mistake here and there . 10/10",1
For his first ever debut this film ha some riveting and chilling moment . In the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film . The ending is superb . The maker of Blaire Witch obviously watched this film it 's ending wa n't an end but a beginning of the end . A great movie and only a piece of Japan 's great a far a scare factor a perfect score it make you think and scared out of your mind .,1
This film contain far too much meaningless violence . Too much shooting and blood . The acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor . The only reason to see this film is if you like very old car .,0
"Pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy . The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong . Examples ? Quantum theory support the idea in eastern religion that reality is an illusion . How ? Well , in the world of the subatomic , you can never definitely predict a particle location at a specific time . You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time . Also , the act of observation seems to affect the event . Solid particle can pas through barrier . All of this , so far , is accurate . But then they assert that that mean that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall , you could indeed do it . This is complete poppycock . Instead , the theory asserts that at our level , it is possible for you to walk through a wall , but it is merely by chance and ha nothing to do with belief . Also you 'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall , the odds are so astronomically against it . This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science . But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer , played by Marlee Maitlan . About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused a to be incomprehensible . Something to do with negative thought leading to addiction and self-hate . There may be some truth to that , but Quantum physic ha nothing to do with it . Plus , string theory is the hot new thing in physic nowadays . Instead of wasting your time with this dreck , I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe , an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that give you a history of physic from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 hour-long episode . Quantum mechanic is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation .",0
"I wa truly looking forward to this title . It sounded and looked fun . The idea of someone making a cheesy 50 monster movie could have been worth a few laugh , but instead this title only bore . First off , there is almost no Froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment . I have to sit through 75+ minute of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpse of the Froggg humping a bare breasted chick . Why ? On top of that the film lack any sort of fun plot . I mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking head . I wanted to see some hot chick search for the creature in the swamp , I wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue ( Creature from the Black Lagoon stuff ) , I wanted to see a few goofy action scene of the Froggg going on a killing spree , or it maybe escaping a silly trap . Something exciting ! Geez , have fun with it , be creative ! Who want to sit through endless and tiring dialog scene in a creature flick ? My advice to the filmmaker : Keep going , your concept are good , but your execution need to be a lot more inspired . Have some fun with the creature , put the humor in the action and most important ... put more creature in a creature movie ! ! !",0
"One of my sister friend lent me this game , and it is too damn hard ! It carry the appearance of a kid game , but you have to learn how to do ton of intricate move that require you to twist and turn your hand into all sort of awkward position , and you have to search seemingly endless level for 100 note , to improve your 'score ' ! You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle piece , that require you to do almost impossible task to get them ! AND I AM ONLY UP TO STAGE THREE ! ! ! ! !

"Chuck Jones 's 'Rabbit Seasoning ' , the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy , is often considered to be the best of the three . While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoon , I would have to concede that 'Rabbit Seasoning ' is the most finely honed script . Here , the emphasis is placed on language a Bugs and Daffy run through a series of complex dialogue in the grand tradition of Abbot and Costello 's 'Who 's on next ' routine . As a long term Daffy fan , I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who get all the best line ( the famous `` Pronoun trouble '' being one of the all time classic ) and doe most of the work . Bugs play the role of cool manipulator while Elmer , a always , is the befuddled dupe . Part of what make the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laugh . Elmer fall into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who come off worst , being shot in the face again and again , his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous position . It all build to the inevitable climactic declaration `` You 're despicable '' . As intricate an example of Chuck Jones 's impeccable timing a you 'll come across , 'Rabbit Seasoning ' is a true classic .",1
"A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touch .... people ripping up pillow and aura of lurking fear . Also , ala , an ending that come out of nowhere , because , apparently , the auteur ha lost interest in the movie , or perhaps because a a B picture it ha to fit into a slot .",1
"`` Crossfire '' is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that 's a murder mystery with a strong message . It star Robert Young , Robert Mitchum , Robert Ryan , Sam Levene , and Gloria Grahame , and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk . We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning , and for the rest of the film , Young , a the detective , Finlay , in charge of the case , seek to figure out which of three soldier is responsible for the death , and just a important , why . The victim , Joseph Samuels ( Sam Levene ) is someone the soldier meet in a bar ; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit , and Samuels wind up dead . I do n't know about 1947 , but seeing `` Crossfire '' today , one know who did it and why the minute we see the suspect . I do n't suppose it wa so apparent back then , a these actor were just getting started . Nevertheless , the film pack a big punch with it powerful acting , good direction , violence , and unsparing anti-Semite language . The characterization are vivid , including that of Gloria Grahame in a smallish role - she 's a woman who meet Mitchell ( George Cooper ) , one of the suspect soldier , in a bar and can provide him with an alibi . The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan , but everyone is excellent . Robert Young especially is effective a a tough but intelligent police detective . Mitchum is very likable a a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell , a lonely man unsure if he still ha feeling for his wife . Truly excellent , and a must see .",1
"AWWWW , I just love this movie to bit . Me and my cousin enjoy this movie a lot and I am just such a HUGE FAN ! ! ! I hope they bring the TV series out on DVD soon . Come to mention it , I have not see the TV show in a LONG time . Such geart time ! Where I come from Australia The Chipmunk Adventure is only known by people in their late teen and adult year which is kinda sad because the young kid do n't know what there missing . The song in this film are ace the one I love the most Boys/girls of rock n'roll , Diamond Dolls and the song that l sure to make you want to cry My Mother . This film is sure to excite both young and old GET THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY ! ! ! 10 out of 10 , such an excellent movie .",1
"Skippy from `` Family Ties '' play Eddie , a wussy 'metal ' nerd who get picked on . When his favorite wussy 'metal ' singer , Sammi Curr , dy , he throw a hissy fit tearing down all the poster on his bedroom wall . But when he later get an unreleased record that hold the spirit of his dead 'metal ' idol . He first get sucked into idea of revenge , but then he doe n't want to take it a far a Sammi doe . Which is n't really that far a his main victim only seem to go to the hospital . This movie is utterly laughable and ha about a much to do with real metal a say , `` Rock Star '' . OK , maybe a tad more than that piece of junk , but you get my point . And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from `` Family Ties '' I have n't a clue . The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK , and Ozzy Osbourne reach coherency , I applaud him for that , but otherwise skip this one .

"Of course I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 a my uncle wa the main screenplay writer of Once upon a Crime . Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplay for over 50 year living in Italy . He wa a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his story into writing . So Rodolfo Sonego did . If you check out his biography , you can see the number of movie that have been made in Italy . Alberto Sordie wa the main actor that starred in his story . My uncle visited Australia and my town , in 1968 to check out location for `` A girl in Australia '' and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war . You can see his humor in all his movie . I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently . GREAT",1
"Goldeneye will always go down a one of thee most legendary game in VG history . Their is no doubt about that . But this game , although quite different , could quite possibly be the modern-day Bond champ , of it time . This wa not a bond game based on material from another medium . This wa a completely new ; scripted game . Which even had it own theme song ! ( wouldnt be bond without it , haha ! ) Gameplay wa excellent , and if you 're a fan of the bond game or film alike , you 'll enjoy it . Unlike some/most game , these cast member portrayed their character themselves , a opposed to fictional creation for the game . Which give it that more cinematic feel . With a very 'bond'-able storyline , you feel like you 're in the game a much a you get lost in a movie . Enjoyable in all aspect , from start to finish . Even after beating the game there 's still plenty more to be done . With the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved , a well a it multi-player mission , this is a stand-out game . Despite being quite old now , in video game year . It 's still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life . Even now just thinking about it , I 've got the theme song stuck in my head . Such a great cast and well-written storyline . The story come to life on the screen , almost a if the actor were their in front of you , and is every bit a entertaining a the game itself . Superbly done , in true bond fashion . Which can only be named Awesome , Completely Awesome . I 've got ta go throw this game on now . If you have n't played it yet , you 're missing out !",1
Helena Bonham Carter is the center of this movie . She play her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity . Kenneth Branagh wa tolerable . The movie itself wa good not exceptional . If you are a Helena Bonham Carter fan it is worth seeing .,1
"I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a `` thumb in the middle '' review , remarking that I 'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode . I 've seen a total of six episode now up to this point in June 2006 . And a a lifelong Batman fanatic , I can say without hesitation : this show is utter crap . Everything 's wrong with it . Everything . Getting past just the lousy animation and design , the story are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writer of this dreck to give any substance to any story . And for God 's sake ... is it just me , or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE ? ? Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system ? Or , again , is it just a complete lack of interest in the writer to put any effort into other villain ( see `` no character development '' , above ) . And to make matter worse , every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula . 1 ) Joker gas people . 2 ) Joker set out to gas the whole city . 3 ) Batman save the day . Pfeh . There wa one episode I saw that wa n't a Joker story . The title escape me , but the villain wa that nefarious Cluemaster ... the `` Think Thank Thunk '' episode with the quiz show . That wa the single-worst Batman story I 've ever seen , heard or read . Yes , worse than `` I 've Got Batman in My Basement . '' I ca n't really say what I feel this show is because it 's probably against the ToS , but it start with `` B '' and rhyme with `` fastardization '' . Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc . era of Bat-entertainment , back from the Fox and Kids WB day . Stuff that good , and I should have known this , just could n't possibly have lasted forever , unfortunately .",0
"Just because someone is under the age of 10 doe not mean they are stupid . If your child like this film you 'd better have him/her tested . I am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turn out so bad . This `` film '' is a showcase for digital wizardry AND NOTHING ELSE . The writing is horrid . I ca n't remember when I 've heard such bad dialogue . The song are beyond wretched . The acting is sub-par but then the actor were not given much . Who decided to employ Joey Fatone ? He can not sing and he is ugly a sin . The worst thing is the obviousness of it all . It is a if the writer went out of their way to make it all a stupid a possible . Great child 's movie are wicked , smart and full of wit - film like Shrek and Toy Story in recent year , Willie Wonka and The Witches to mention two of the past . But in the continual dumbing-down of American more are flocking to dreck like Finding Nemo ( yes , that 's right ) , the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and eye-crossing trash like Red Riding Hood .",0
"`` Hey Babu Riba '' is a film about a young woman , Mariana ( nicknamed `` Esther '' after a famous American movie star ) , and four young men , Glenn , Sacha , Kicha , and Pop , all perhaps 15-17 year old in 1953 Belgrade , Yugoslavia . The five are committed friend and crazy about jazz , blue jean , or anything American it seems . The very close relationship of the teenager is poignant , and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who ha fallen on unexpected difficulty . In the wake of changing communist politics , they go their separate way and reunite in 1985 ( the year before the film wa made ) . I enjoyed the film with some reservation . The subtitle for one thing were difficult . Especially in the beginning , there were a number of dialogue which had no subtitle at all . Perhaps the conversational pace required it , but I could n't always both read the text and absorb the scene , which caused me to not always understand which character wa involved . I watched the movie ( a video from our public library ) with a friend , and neither of u really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative . This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenager ' sense of invulnerability , idealism , and strong and loyal bond to each other . There is a main flashforward , and it wa intriguing , keeping me guessing until the end a to who these character were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast , and what had actually happened . I would rate it 7 out of 10 , and would like to see other film by the director , Jovan Acin ( 1941-1991 ) .",1
"After a snowstorm , the road are blocked and the highway patrolman Jason ( Adam Beach ) come to the diner of his friend Fritz ( Jurgen Prochnow ) and advises his client that they will only be able to follow their trip on the next day . Among the weird stranger , Jason meet his former sweetheart Nancy ( Rose McGowan ) , who ha just left her husband in Los Angeles . Along the night , without any communication with his base , Jason face distressful and suspicious situation with the client , and find some corps , indicating that among them there is a killer . `` The Last Stop '' could be an average thriller , but the screenplay is simply awful . Most of the character are despicable person and the motif of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed , and the viewer have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guest . My vote is four . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Encurralados '' ( `` Trapped '' )",0
"This movie wa a fairly entertaining comedy about Murphy 's Law being applied to home ownership and construction . If a film like this wa being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional . Since it wa set in the 'simpler ' forty , we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era . Grant of course perfectly blend the comedic and dramatic element and he work with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas . Their shenanigan make for a solid ninety minute of entertainment , 7/10 .",1
"What can you say about the film White Fire . Amazing ? Fantastic ? Disturbing ? Hilarious ? These word are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire . From wobbly , garbled beginning to profound end , this movie will entertain throughout . Our movie begin in the wood of a country somewhere in the world . A family is hiding from unmarked soldier in costume shop uniform . When the father separate from the mother and their childen , you get a real sense of what kind of movie you 're about to watch . Father make sure to roll down hill in his all white outfit , and is polite a he get people 's attention before he shoot them , but ala , dad is burned alive in what look like a very unsupervised , unsafe stunt . Meanwhile , mom and the kid are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 foot behind them . He too give a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre `` HALT ! `` , and then promptly waste the mother . This action sequence set up the happy childhood of our hero Bo and Ingred . So now we fast forward about 20 year ( 30 if you 're honest about the hero 's age ) to beautiful Turkey , where Bo and Ingred have settled a professional thief , or diamond prospector , or something . Ingred work at a diamond mine where she help herself to the good , while Bo ( masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty ) drive around the desert in his denim outfit . Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship . They do n't seem to have any friend other than each other , and they spend all of their time together . That coupled with the fact that Bo ha expressed his desire to sleep with his sister a evidenced in line such a `` you know it a shame you 're my sister '' he say to her while she 's stark naked , make for a very dynamic duo . Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed , a he wanders the beach of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf . A renewal of hope occurs when Bo find a girl who look like Ingrid , and give her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid . This open the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong . Bo is a real fan of ethical grey area , and he is overjoyed with his new love . So anyway , there 's a lot of fun action scene , ridiculous violence , great acting , impossible to follow plot-lines , Fred `` the hammer '' Williamson ( for some reason ) , and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond ( which later explodes ) . All of these thing are great , but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what make this movie special .... really special . So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire . You may be glad you did .. or not .",1
"I am so disappointed . This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy . Here wa the quintessential Woody Allen film all over again : the neurotic upper-class Manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouse . Woody , I 've seen these character already , I 've seen the storyline from you ten time already . Where did your creativity go ? ? ? You need to open your eye and look around you . The world ha changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you need to change along with it . There are far more interesting and funny scenario to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again . When I hear that Woody Allen ha a new project coming out , it doe nothing for me - because now I 've come to expect his old standby : the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating . Depressing and same old , same old . If Woody want to win his fan back , then he ha to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence ha to be stimulated - not insulted .",0
"This movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff , predictable from beginning to end . As a Don Knotts vehicle , `` The Incredible Mr. Limpet '' wa much better , with Knott 's character there not nearly a incompetent or ignorant . His performance there wa toned down , with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare , although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish . Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile , much a Bob Denver did . Neither really seemed to be able to break out to other type of role , assuming they were simply typecast . It wa probably because of the slouch , the wild stare and the high-pitched voice . John Ritter , whom Knotts worked with in `` Three 's Company , '' wa able to transcend his genre , branching out successfully into dramatic role like `` The Dreamer of Oz , '' but the closest Knotts ever got wa a small role in `` Pleasantville . '' Even Leslie Nielsen wa a bad fit here , uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor a he wa at the time nor deadpan comedic actor a he later became in `` Airplane ! '' and `` Police Squad . '' There 's also no way the then-43 year-old Knotts could pas for a 35 year-old , a his character insisted he wa . It wa a ludicrously unbelievable a Tom Hanks at 38 playing the college-age Forrest Gump . The film wa clearly made on a shoestring budget , very much looking like a hastily-filmed TV episode . It 's especially evident in the `` exterior '' scene of the `` town '' where Roy go after he 's fired . It 's unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the Mayberry-like soundstage artificiality . Even viewing this strictly a a child 's movie , it 's very disappointing . It 's not because it lack action or special effect , although it doe . The pace is much too slow , the situation repetitive . How many time can you watch Roy getting onto a bus ? A comedy for kid should at least sometimes be madcap , with breakneck gag , otherwise you risk boring them ( and any adult in the theater a well ) . Movies , even kid 's movie , have improved quite a bit in the intervening decade . Even many contemporary comedy were better filmed and written . Disney 's `` The Love Bug , '' for instance , at least had some interesting race action .",0
"If you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization , there is an excellent book called `` Outlaw Seas '' or `` The Outlaw Sea '' , and it describes , in story after story , how these thing do happen . The lawlessness of the high sea is a reality for a number of reason . One , many of the world 's freighter are of questionable registry ( nationality ) and it 's difficult to impossible to enforce international law when the ship owner do n't have an office in a real country . Two , many ship line employ crew from dirt poor third world country . The crew are often ( like illegal immigrant worker ) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practice . Three , there is often a language barrier , not only between the officer and the crew , but also between the crew member themselves . The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence . Four , once committing an illegal act , the ship are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint . Anyway , it 's fascinating reading . Horrifying story , excellent movie . Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movie ? Hollywood ha trouble releasing enough Oscar worthy movie in any given year , so that several of the top 5 contender usually come from Britain . Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema . I loved the thoroughly evil performance by Sean Pertwee . I also , a usual , loved Omar Epps .",1
"Gamers : DR is not a fancy made movie , it 's more like amateur video . Horrible magic effect , really fake fireball , terribly made dungeon , castle , village ...... sword , axe , shield , robe , plate ..... okok ... everything . You will need about 10 minute to adjust your expecting on visual , then you will get 105 minute of fun . I 'm from Hongkong and it 's really hard to find RPers , none of my friend play RPG and I always fancy to be one of the character in the world of D & D . Watching Gamers : DR just show me what would it be like to be a gamer . You see rule book , dice , game set , etc etc etc ; You hear term like `` fighter '' , `` wizard '' , `` hit point '' , `` level '' , `` character '' , `` flaming hand '' , `` Chaotic Evil '' . What RPG fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to , not bonded by software RPG . Gamers : DR provide the same element , you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead . The movie go both gamers 's real life a well a in the D & D world . You will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action , which make you feel you really participle in the game . I do n't want to spoil anything , but in short , Gamers : DR is a must watch movie for RPG lover . For people never play RPG game , I 'm sure you still get many fun from it .",1
"In all honesty , I have n't seen this film for many year , but the few time I have tend to make part of it stick in my memory , a anyone who ha seen it will understand . I first saw it a a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties , and it scared the hell out of u kid , in a fun way . I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze . I ca n't risk giving away the ending , except to say that it wa surprising , to say the least . I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boy letting out a big scared holler , followed by laughter when the terrible secret wa revealed . The ending ha been seen by most viewer a one of the greatest unintentionally funny climax to a movie in film history , and yet oddly moving , in a way . You have to see it for yourself , which is not easy these day . I do n't know if it 's available on home video or not , but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kid and adult .",0
"This is the only thing I will be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that rocked . It rocked hard , and yet it also rocked tasty . Mr.MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credit even rolled . Now that tell you something , this filmed rocked even before it STARTED ! Now I do n't want to give to much away or be a `` spoiler '' but this movie ROCKED ! If you have heard the new album and thought to yourself `` this seems a bit substandard Tenacious material , it is like I a merely playing badminton with Satan , what give ? '' Then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece . For those who would want it better do not know what they want , because better would no longer be the D. This movie is the D period . ! So venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your sock rocked .",1
"You 'd think you 're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie take place primarily between two character a they travel 3000 mile or so from France to Saudi Arabia , going through most of Europe - Italy , Bulgaria , Croatia , Slovenia , Turkey , before arriving in the Middle East . But this is not a tour , and there are no stopover for soaking in the sight . Reda 's father is in his twilight year , and wish to do the Haj . However , since walking and taking the mule is out of the question , he chooses to travel to Mecca by car . He ca n't drive , and therefore enlists the help of Reda , to his son 's protest , to get him there in their broken down vehicle . But Reda doe n't see the point of having him go along , when his dad could opt for the plane . He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he could n't understand . And hence , we set off in this arduous journey with father and son , being not the best of pal . The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair , the challenge they face , the weird people they meet , having to duke it out in varied weather condition , and alternating rest stop between motel and sleeping in the car . We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other , the father trying to impose on his son , and the son trying to assert himself a an adult , but circumstance we see , reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water . Through the many encounter , they actually team up quite well despite their difference . It 's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji , and having the opportunity to watch our protagonist join the other pilgrim in their Haj . The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold , and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear a Reda try to hunt down his dad amongst the thousand of people congregating . The sight of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon , so a to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination . It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved one how much you appreciate them for who they are . Do n't miss this , and yes , book early - I wa pleasantly surprised that this evening 's session wa still a full house .",1
"I watched this movie based on the good review here , and I wo n't make that mistake again . The first couple minute show that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy , but you do n't see what it is . Flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring life of each of these people , which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen . When the ending is finally reveled , you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doe n't happen and mean nothing to what you have been watching . The only connection these people have is that they have all had a `` bad day '' -- but even that continuity get lost in the boredom . If this wa supposed to be a `` Crash '' clone , it 's a complete failure .",0
"A great Bugs Bunny cartoon from the earlier year ha Bugs a a performer in an window display at a local department store .

Bugs is happy to oblige into he figure out that the new job is in taxidermy ... and that taxidermy ha to do with stuffing animal . Animals like say , a certain rabbit . This cause a battle of wit between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer . I found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better one of the early 1940 's . It still remains a funny nearly 60+ year later . This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 . My Grade : A-",1
"I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent year wa in 2003 for two reason : 1 ) Host Steve Martin wa at his most wittiest : `` I saw the teamster help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo `` and `` I 'll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle 's head in my bed `` 2 ) Surprise winner : No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeer and boo ) but they won Last year 's award ceremony wa n't too bad but there wa little in the way of surprise and I wa happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the award even if it wa n't the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP wa much better ) but what let the BBC coverage down wa Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mate round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I wa expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the link , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critic ( Obviously they are ) I 'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinion on the winner and loser Chris Rock wa n't too bad , but he 's no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sport hall with seat put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony wa the format with the `` minor `` Oscars handed out to the winner who were sitting in their seat ! There 's no such thing a a `` minor `` Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they 're a well deserved a Best Picture or Best Director . All the winner should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snob the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comment that this format is disgraceful and if it wa n't for the surprise this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the award themselves Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaint since Freeman is one of America 's greatest living character actor Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning wa going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese wa going to get the award simply because he 'd never won one . Actually I 'm glad about this because if he did n't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he did n't deserve it for THE AVIATOR Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the award for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB 's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voter off What these award perhaps illustrate is that this year the voter have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out award to people who deserve it something they have n't done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd 's sake ! And long may the academy vote with their head instead of their heart",0
"While in a plane , flicking through the large choice of movie , I came across Live ! almost accidentally . oh boy ! what a choice . I remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show . Now I can easily say this ha been a hell of a ride . I do n't remember last time I have been so excited , terrified . Not sure if it wa the high altitude playing with my sens , but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you ca n't turn away from the screen , literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nail you 've got . You will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show . You will drift from thinking `` how come the human being can be so vicious '' to `` why not after all ? `` .Ask yourself would you do it . Then learn about the contestant , their motif and start guessing . You will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe . Good acting , good directing , with a movie experience that reminds you those old movie where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more . * Spoilers * couple of thing i would have changed : - the casting of the contestant . i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him . The idea of a rich writer who want to be famous is a bit stupid , it felt like you did n't care about some of the contestant . Although this might have been done on purpose , i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestant . - game rule , a big glitch : what happens if the 5th contestant doe n't die when he pull the trigger . do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself ! ! ! they should have given a chance to all contestant to live , ie : if 5th is a blank too , then no one dy . interestingly I have n't been bothered too much by this bad point cause i really had a good time . just wish i had some popcorn with me !",1
"Ah , another movie with motorcycle , hell 's angel posse and Steve A-Lame-o a the not-so-cool car driver . This movie doe not rely on story but lot of drinking , pot smoking , and lot of moronic act . Steve 's rendition of a dying cat during his `` I love what I know '' serenade had me vomiting for hour . Bike chick Linda ( rrrr ) make out with everyone ! Fats did the best acting since he just grunt and make sound . I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying . `` You messin ' wit private stock . '' This is scriptwriting folk . I liked the ending . What better place to have the climax than a lighthouse ! You have to see this to detest it . DIE Jeter , DIE ! ! !",0
"A rating of `` 1 '' doe not begin to express how dull , depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is .",0
"I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min , luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain , people should watch better film and take note on why they are rated highly , not because of the budget of the film or the special effect , just simply good acting and getting simple thing right , and MOst importantly -- not being LAME -- , but i guess this wa produced for those Sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is `` A good Movie '' do n't be scared of rating film low , save your under-appreciated high score for `` once in a life time movie '' . Keep in mind that many use IMDb for trusted review and opinion , do n't spoil the broth by sugarcoating turd Peace & love",0
"The most self-indulgent movie I have every had the misfortune to rent . Unwatchable . Much of the movie is obviously improvised , and not well . It look like Toback took the first take of everything . The movie get good for a couple of minute when Robert Downey Jr. show up , then go to hell again real quickly .",0
"This ha got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in . This movie just doe not have what he need to be funny . I think the reason that the Naked Gun and the like movie is that they did not require Nielson to be funny . He just played the role a straight a he could while all of the comedy that went on wa mostly visual . But when you put him in a movie where he ha to be funny , he is n't . The movie had only one good part , and this may be considered a spoiler by some , and that the beginning credit were animated . If the whole movie had been animated , it might have been good . I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ad for it , and the only reason I did see it wa because the ticket were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest . This is the first and probably only movie I have ever walked out on . On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a score of -100 .",0
"I like Ghost story . Good ghost story of bump in the night , voice that can not be explained . Now I 've see many of them . As special efx have a ever more grip on today film , some time to find a real gem , you got ta turn the clock back to the time when the writer and director really had to use their head to create really good ghost story . Now this one , very rare , pilot episode for the TV series Ghost Story called `` The New House `` wa one of the most scariest film I ever saw . It wa on once in 1972 , ... I wa only 9 , .. but nothing since then even compared to it . With all the remake going on in Hollywood , some one should do this one `` a is `` with no more special efx than the original . This episode wa down right creepy a hell . I 'm lucky to find it finally on DVD today and very rare and hard to find . The only other 2 Ghost Stories to even come close wa the ORIGINAL `` The Haunting `` and George C. Scott in `` The Changling `` . Wish someone would do more ghost story like these .",1
"Okay , I 've watched this movie twice now , I have researched it heavily on the net , I have asked several people on there opinion . I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla ' , a book that this movie is supposed to be based on . I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it . As the plot of the movie doe n't seem to make any sense at all , here is the plot of the book . Laura life in a castle in Syberia with her Father , Mr De Lafontaine . They carry on with their life blissfully and peacefully . One day they get a letter from the 'General ' a man who ha made it his mission in life to avenge his daughter death . He make claim of supernatural power being at work , and explains that he will visit them soon . Meanwhile , a chance encounter with a strange woman result in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter , Carmilla , for several month . Soon Laura start to be overwhelmed by strange dream , and begin to come down with a strange illness . Who is this mysterious Carmilla ? And just what ha she to do with Laura 's condition , and the General ? I have invented this game and would like a many people a possible to play it , and let me know what their result are . I even have a catchy name , and would have a jingle too , but I ca n't be bothered with that . It 's called the `` this movie doe n't make any sense '' game . All you have to do is , whilst watching the movie , try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening . I mean complete , all question answered , everything make sense , absolutely complete . It will have to answer such question a ... * Why can vampire walk around in day light ? * Why are they all lesbian ? * Why is a girl called Bob ? and why doe she shoot herself ? * When is the movie a dream and when is it real ? * Why doe killing zombie appear to be an accepted part of life that doe n't make anyone bat an eyelid ? * Why doe Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car , yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car , accept the excuse that she is a zombie too ? * And why doe he then let a girl , which he later openly reveals that he know is the head vampire , drive with him in his car ? * And then let her drive off , alone with his daughter in a stolen car ? What the hell is the asylum scene all about ? * What the hell is the green goo all about ? * Why doe the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse ? * Why are there never any vampire fighting Zombies ? * What is the significance of the necklace ? what is it made of ? why doe it kill vampire ? and how doe Jenna know that ? In fact sod it , it 's just a much fun trying to come up with a many question about this movie too . I have my plot , and I have to admit it is not quite there , but it is a pretty good effort . In Conclusion 'Vampires v Zombies ' ha no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies . Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on , yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this . And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel . How ? Why ? What the hell is going on ?",0
"This would 've been a * great * silent film . The acting really is good , at least in a Look Ma , I 'm Doing Really Big Acting ! sort of way . Everything is HUGE . Every line is PROFOUND ! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY ! Mostly , I felt like gagging . Yet , like any train wreck , I could n't tear my eye away . This dialogue might 've worked on the stage , although I doubt it . On the screen , it wa cluttered , haphazard , hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work . If you enjoy your melodrama in huge , heaping dos , you * might * enjoy the movie . Be prepared to wait , however . For all that melodrama , this thing sure plod along at it own pace . This script must 've sounded a lot different when the actor involved were reading it to themselves . It simply doe n't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera . IMDB doe u a great disservice , at time , when it us it goofy computer-controlled `` weighted score '' . Curse of the Starving Class deserves le than a 1 . Character-driven fiction is great , but when you develop your character by simply pushing them through hoop with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution , it is n't character development ! Your character must have a motivation . Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * character development . That 's a plot contrivance . Stay away from this movie . Or at the very least , watch it muted . Perhaps you 'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the character do . Oh , and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film , you see James Woods in all his dangly male `` look-at-me , I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man '' glory . Do n't say you were n't warned .",0
"This movie start with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward , attended by two orderly . The unconscious main character is heard in a voice over , saying that the orderly are gay . The orderly kiss . I watched this in a DVD version and I have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny  it said comedy '' on the DVD case , after all and it go on like that . Had I seen this in a movie theater I probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter , because it is so funny  and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy . While it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what is n't , this movie unfortunately only delivers argument about what is n't . Brilliant brain can MAKE anything funny , people like Ernst Lubitsch , Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proved that fact . But you have to know the mechanics '' , I suppose . Director and co-scriptwriter Dani Levy doe not bother about those mechanic , he think that certain thing simply ARE funny , the fact that two orderly are gay and kiss over a man in a coma , for example . Do not get me wrong , some people can MAKE that funny , Dani Levy ca n't , not for me , anyway . The main problem I have with this movie is that I ca n't see a reason behind the way the main character behave . I could not understand why the two brother , one an orthodox Jew from West Germany one a third class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany so strongly disliked each other . They are both rather bland character . Their child are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other ( well , one is a lesbian now but raise the daughter she ha with her cousin ) . But even these incestuous relationship  if anything they are embarrassing - just come through a an excuse because the scriptwriter could not come up with anything better . The acting is not bad , Udo Semel I actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor Helmut Kohl ( a lighter version ) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew . The direction in itself is not really bad either , but maybe Levy should stick to directing movie , leaving the scriptwriting to someone else . Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler . Oi , Vai !",0
"This story about three woman is a very sensitive study about : Muriël ( Charlotte Van Den Eynde ) the youngest , Laura ( Els Dottermans ) who is about 37 and Martha ( Frieda Pittors ) the oldest who is the mother of Muriël . They live together in the same building . They have different expectation of life . The vital Laura want a child . Muriël come from a village and want to change her life in Brussels . Martha dream about her youth when she wa a young girl . In fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instance an accident - which could dramatize this story . As time go on , you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only want to develop a psychological portrait of the three woman and nothing more . This movie is disappointing because you expect the woman to learn from their experience which is not the case , so one is left with a feeling of emptiness .",0
"First and foremost , I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury . It 's the kind of horror that get under your skin and stick with you later . It wa one of his best book , with , you know , Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine . I a just hoping that this movie would be all right . It had lot of chance , with a great cast , like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce . And Bradbury even wrote the script himself . And on top of all that , it ha PAM GRIER ! How could it fail ? There may be spoiler within . First of all , it wa dumbed down . Much of the horror from the book wa lost a Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum . All the visuals from the book ... gone . Everything that made you squirm ... gone . And then there 's the acting . Like a lot of movie that Disney threw out in the 80 , the kid in this movie can not act . And , this bugged me a lot , neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 . Their strong friendship wa n't addressed . It wa more like they were acquaintaces . You 'd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their role of Mr. Halloway and Mr . Dark . But here it 's like they just do n't care . All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something . This is far from being some of their best performance . Pam Grier wa fine a the witch , but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself wa n't well pulled off . She 's a lot le evil and doe n't have the presence a she did in the book . And everything that wa left out of the book . The ballon night chase , the marking of Jim 's house , the real death of Mr . Dark , what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merry-go-round , the fate of the lightening rod salesman , the real death of the witch , and oh so much more . And the special effect were bad , even for the 80 . The merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horse going around wa n't really creepy , and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything . I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel , but it make blood boil . Do n't see this movie but read the book . It 's a classic of Bradbury .",0
"This film is so old I never realized how young looking Ray Milland looked in 1936 , I remember him playing in a great film , `` Lost Weekend '' . Ray play the role of Michael Stuart , who is a very rich banker . There are three girl in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy . They hire a man to pose a a very rich Count , his name is Count Ariszted , ( Misha Auer ) who is drunk all the time and is penniless and give plenty of comic laugh throughout the picture . Deanna Durbin , ( Penny Craig ) surprised everyone when she wa booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she wa an opera star and then Penny start singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I have every heard , the entire police department and convict started applauding , which wa a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film . This is Deanna Durbin 's first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM .",1
"I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it wa given to me on DVD at Christmas . Having reserved a special slot for it last night , I sat down to watch it with my daughter ( aged 17 and a Film Studies student ) , with chocolate of course , in eager anticipation . We love Jane Austin . After just the first two minute we knew we were sunk . The shaky camera shot and angle , general poor cinematography , direction and wooden performance had already left u feeling flat and dissatisfied . Despondent , we viewed on . Anne , played by Sally Hawkins , looked oddly and with no particular purpose , directly at the camera on several occasion , breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment ' and engaging u directly in an almost ' I 'll find you ' stalking fashion . Poor Rupert Penry-Jones , who played Captain Wentworth , did his best with the script and direction , bless him . I hope they paid him well , however , a he wa practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall , drenching him and his co-actor . They were nearly swept out to sea . Health and Safety would have had a field day ! Poor Rupert wa left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line . Presumably there wa not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene . Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place . Other than Mr. Penry-Jones , Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance a Lady Russell but her effort were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head 's unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott . Towards the long-awaited end of the film , Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two second having taken great pain to avoid her for the majority of the movie . It wa a if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being . In contrast , Anne ran , hyper-ventilating , from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who , in the meantime , had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told , in the course of only three or four minute , without even having worked up a sweat . We experienced none of Anne 's charm crossing the screen . Indeed , we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain , spineless , opinion-less Anne and why someone , anyone , did not tell mean , winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up . The crucial kiss , normally our favourite girlie moment , wa painfully drawn out . As they moved in closer , Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look a if she were chewing gum before lip finally met . Eww ! The most enjoyable thing about last night wa the chocolate and the half hour exchange of view between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been . What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story , filmed in some of England 's finest scenery . Sorry Jane .",0
"If you like Sci-Fi , Monsters , and Ancient Legends , then you will love this movie ! ! The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen year ago . While the acting may have been a little le than desirable , the story line and effect adequately compensated for it . I wish now I had seen this at the movie on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV . If you like non-stop action , awesome visuals , and taste for myth and lore .... you have to see this movie ! !",1
"A rather silly little film you just may love . Although rather corny and cliché at time , it nonetheless work and make for good clean fun . Five team are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wit to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy `` knowing yours is the best team . '' Notable for several screen debut including David Naughton 's first film role after his Dr. Pepper `` Be a Pepper '' commercial and before his major 1981 hit `` American Werewolf in London '' . Also feature Paul Ruebens in what I believe is his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire roll a year before he became known for it . And last but not least , Mr . Spin City and Alex Keaton himself , Michael J . Fox get his first film role here . Fans will remember Stephen Furst a Flounder in Animal House . Outside of that , no name , but all funny character . Doubt it ha ever made it to DVD , but there are still probably some VHS copy floating around and you might even catch on a late , late show sometime . If you do , is worth your watch .

"This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown . I ca n't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy . Given the excellent story , the result could have been better though . The movie is pretty long but at the end I wa feeling like some thing were missing . Sound effect and sound track were very good . Acting wa well done but the character development phase wa very weak . For people who did n't read the book , thing may look happening too quickly . From my point of view , instead of trying to put a much a stuff from the book , they could have tried to do the important scene more proper . What make the book very good wa all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican . You see neither of it in the movie . Too much rush and using the time not in a good way , these are main problem of the movie . So , it is worth watching but could have been done better .",1
"I never fell asleep during a movie . Never . This movie did the impossible . While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror film over their American counterpart , this movie wa a lesson in over abundance . As in , the movie wa 30 minute too long . It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work , but instead , all we got were awkward silence and a lot of slow movement . The acting wa absolutely terrible , bordering on bad student film level while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script . Did these people even get any direction ? Were they coaxed to be boring and dull ? Either therory would n't surprise me . What wa even worse wa the rather unscary make-up involved with the creature from the other side . Either way , they all stunk . Do n't watch this film . That 's all I can say ( unless you 're an insomniac ) .",0
"What can I say ? Not a bad a many here have made it out to be . The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before , wa strictly for IAN McSHANE . I wa not disappointed in the least . IAN McSHANE wa absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role . He 's always great to watch and for my money ... an extremely underused actor . As for the rest of the film .... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong , solid performance . These people certainly were n't being paid huge amount of cash for their participation ( a this wa a fairly low budget film ) but this did not mean that any of them `` mailed '' their appearance in . Everyone wa convincing and compelling with the part given to them . I wa even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL 's performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie . The plot wa well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life , not everything end up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film . Anybody who expected a clear-cut , by-the-numbers , connect the dot `` conclusion '' or `` answer '' at the end of the movie ... CLEARLY wa n't watching the film closely enough ! This film is not going to tell you what the `` meaning of life '' is ! The idea is that after seeing the film , you might go and discus the unanswered question with your friend over a coffee . I certainly did . No car chase ... No explosion ... No bar room brawl .... ( sound pretty dull , huh ? ) But the reality is that I wa completely absorbed by the film and it 's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performance by all party involved . * * * * * * WARNING ... * * * * * * If you 're the kind of person who dislike movie that dangle an enormous `` question '' a the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly ... YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM .",1
"Originally harped a a sequel to `` The Slumber Party Massacre '' series , this film fall flat on it 's face with a new title . First off , if you are going to include the word `` massacre '' in your film 's title , you better deliver . This one certainly doe not . There is no gore , no on screen murder and no chainsaw , a the box art would lead you to believe . Instead , we get a paper thin , overdone plot about a group of cheerleader who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game , only to be offed one by one . Again , this film could have been OK if the gore quotient wa upped a bit . Why director , especially those doing direct-to-video flick , are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me . Now , I am not a huge fan of excessive gore , but come on ... why else would anyone rent a movie called `` Cheerleader Massacre ? ? '' Besides that problem , the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness . It look cheap , sound cheap , and the actor are n't all that good . It try to throw u off track to who the killer may be , but even that fails . The ending end up being a ridiculous mess . Folks , if you run across this film , walk away and go find the original `` Slumber Party Massacre . '' 2 out of 10 .",0
"A killer , cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder . At his grave a cult have gathered with plan to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave . This of course work and he awakes ripping the guy penis off and he is back into his old killing way with an all new zombie look . The two cop one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and ha a drug problem , are back on the case . Two of the original cult member also try to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing . Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave come a plastic baby doll that wa used in the original resurrection . Sounds a bit confusing really but no it just rubbish . The acting is terrible and one of the cop is the same guy that play Dr Vincent van Gore in the face of gore series and he is just a terrible a the annoying cop in this film . The other cop just about struggle to get his terrible line out . Now I 'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible . If it wa n't for the very easy on the eye lady and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep . There is a bit of gore but it 's never more than some animal gut placed on the stomach of the victim . The zombie makeup on the other hand look great and his foot long penis that he us to rape his victim with is kind of funny at time . There is also a half decent scene where the killer fall in love with a sex doll . The doll with the chipmunk voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film . It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line . The ending is extremely bad . You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he doe . God know how they made enough money to make a sequel . 4/10",0
"Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless film I have ever seen . In no way , shape , or form would I recommend it to anyone ... unless you 're trying to put your kid to sleep or , God forbid , give someone an aneurysm . If I could go back in time and do one thing , I would set fire to the reel before they were sent to theater . Why ? Days of Heaven 's plot is simple , but extremely vague . Long sequence devoid of dialogue compose much of the film . The character are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with . The climax of the story doe not touch you : by this time your brain ha worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphor that your ability to think is gone . The only thing working are your eye , and unfortunately , your ear , who must listen to the sound of Linda , the little girl in the story , who talk like a man . I am now dumber for seeing this movie . Do n't let it happen to you .",0
"In 1929 , director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their `` Silly Symphonies '' series , `` The Skeleton Dance '' . Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20 , in Disney 's `` Laugh-O-Gram '' cartoon series ; however , their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio . That wa the birth of Celebrity Productions , where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique ( and where he created the character of Flip the Frog ) . While his work kept the same high quality , it wa n't really popular and by 1936 the studio wa closed . Later that year , Iwerks wa hired by Columbia Pictures , and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeleton for another dance , this time in color . 1937 's `` Skeleton Frolics '' is essentially , a remake of the 1929 classic `` The Skeleton Dance '' , the movie that borough him fame and fortune . Like that short film , it is set on an abandoned graveyard , where at midnight the creature of the night come alive and begin to play . The dead rise from their coffin , ready for the show that 's about to begin , a a group of skeleton ha formed an orchestra , and begin to play a happy tune . Now , it 's not easy to be a musician made of just bone , a some of the orchestra member have problem with their body part , however , the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeleton begin to dance . A lovely couple of them face the same problem that troubled the orchestra : it 's hard to dance with loose body part . Everything end at dawn , and just when the sun is about to rise again , the skeleton run towards their graf . Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself , `` Skeleton Frolics '' follows faithfully the pattern set by `` The Skeleton Dance '' year before , although with a crucial difference : Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor . The bright tonality allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film , and also to use the many new technique he had been practicing since leaving Disney , creating even better effect of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before . It is certainly a more experimental film than `` The Skeleton Dance '' , although sadly , this doe n't mean it 's necessarily a better film . For starter , the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney , with the only difference being the music ( more on that later ) and the color effect . It look beautiful , no doubt about it , but it definitely feel kind of unoriginal after all . However , it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurt the film ( after all , Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way ) , but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lack the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W. Stalling for `` The Skeleton Dance '' . In other word , while DeNat 's tune is effective and appropriate for the theme , it 's easy to forget about it rapidly while Stalling 's song ha a unique personality that make it unforgettable . Being a musical film , this is of high importance , and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerk 's flawless work of animation . Personally , I think that with a better musical accompaniment , `` Skeleton Frolics '' would be remembered a fondly a `` The Skeleton Dance despite not being a groundbreaking , a it 's still a fun film to watch . It 's kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success , however , it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer ( Disney 's main rival ) , he did not lack the quality of those company ' film . It wa probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disney 's mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney . Despite it shortcoming , `` Skeleton Frolics '' is a very funny and visually breathtaking film , that while not exactly the most original and fresh film ( one just ca n't help but thinking of `` The Skeleton Dance '' while watching it ) , it definitely reminds u that Iwerk 's skeleton are still here to haunt u , and inspire u . 8/10",1
"Yes , indeed , it could have been a good movie . A love biangle , ( sorry for the poetical license , but is not a triangle ! ) an interesting story , unfortunately badly told . The image is sometimes weird , sometimes OK , the picture look crowded and narrow-sighted . The sound need more attention ( it usually doe in Romanian movie ) , the light and color filter are sometimes badly chosen . The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action . About the acting ... sorry but the best actress is the landlady . The others are acting immaturely and can not convince the viewer . The acting is poetical when it should be realistic , and realistic when it should be poetical . It 's a picture for adult , told by the child . Bother only if extremely curious .",0

The character of James Bond wa created by Ian Fleming , and is the movie industry 's longest lasting icon , being the subject of over fifteen film spanning over four decade . The latest man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan , who took over the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996 , and made his 007 debut in Goldeneye . This is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64 . Goldeneye , developed by Rare for Nintendo , ha been on the market for some time . Its continued dominance in the sale chart is just one testament to how good this game is , and no review library would be complete without it . Let 's face it -- most of the time movie-licensed game are flop . Although the two seem like a good mix , the result , for the most part , have been horrendous . Games like Cliffhanger , True Lies , Lethal Weapon , and not to mention all the Star Trek flop , are ammunition enough against this mix . And for the record I am not a fan of movie licensed game , especially if I 've seen the movie . At least that 's how I used to think . In the case of Goldeneye , I had more reservation than normal . While not a bad movie , Goldeneye the film did n't have that much appeal to it , and I do n't rank it in the top ten amongst Bond movie . As a game , however , let 's just say it 's a completely different story . The game is a first-person shooter , and in order to be successful , you 'll need at least a much brain a brawn . For those who have seen the movie , which I imagine is most of you reading this , the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation . A plot to control the world 's most dangerous satellite , Goldeneye , ha begun in the USSR , and in the process a beautiful woman ha been captured . Your mission will be many , the danger extreme . You will have to rely on your wit and experience to get you through the most grueling mission the world ha ever known . M will brief you a soon a you 're ready . Good day , James .",1
"This is an excellent film about the character in a adult swimming class , their problem , relationship and interaction with each other . It should have managed a wider distribution a it 's much better than similar film from major studio out at the same time . The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian , reduced to teaching adult basic lesson , and often the target of horndogging from his female student . He attempt , more or le , to fend them off , with varying result . The student character are mainstream U.S.A ; teacher , policeman , college student and retired people , all of whom have n't learned to swim for some reason . The movie cover their relationship , including friend , relative and romantic conquest a they go through the class . Several subplots provide amusing fodder , including a teacher going through a divorce , some high school student making a documentary , and a girl who is only in the class to meet guy . This is a good date movie , or just one to watch when you 're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtone of reality .",1
"This mostly routine fact-based TV drama get a boost from the fine performance by Cole . This is the story of a highly trained military man , unhappy with his wife and child , fake his demise and run off with the other woman . To support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs bank . Predictable , but not a bad watch .",1
"I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - he 's only in it for around 10 minute and ha one long scene , the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville , and several other great moment . The reamaining 55 minute are also delightful , thankfully , mostly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles a the bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney . He is everyone 's foil . He stutter and stumble about to our pleasure . Also , his comedy partner , Mary Boland play his wife , Flora . Joining in the proceeding are George Burns and Gracie Allen . Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end , but Gracie and Ruggles use up most of the picture . Gracie 's funny , quite , but she can also get tiring . And poor George Burns ha absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time . I do n't remember laughing at him once ( although he ha one great scene with Ruggles , where Ruggles try desperately to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while , and one with Fields , where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater ; that bit is exclusively Fields ' , though ) . The situation is constantly funny : the Whinneys are going to drive to California , but to help them with expense , George and Gracie are recruited . 8/10 .",1
"EDMUND LOWE ( who reminds me somewhat of Warren William ) , head the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that move at a brisk pace and run just a little over an hour . Douglas Walton play the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise ( hypnotism , anyone ? ) , and the suspect include a good number of the supporting cast -- everyone from Virginia Bruce , Kent Smith , Frieda Inescourt , Gene Lockhart , Jessie Ralph , Benita Hume , Rosalind Ivan and H.B . Warner . As an added bonus , there 's Nat Pendleton a a dimwit detective -- and furthermore , get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interior of a wealthy home . Must have been a set that wa used in many a subsequent film . On the plus side , the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled . It 's all suddenly clear to detective Philo Vance -- and then he ha a final confrontation with the murderer that give the film a nifty five minute of unmitigated suspense . Nicely done and pass the time in an entertaining manner .",1
"This movie is lame and not funny at all . The plot doe n't even make sense . Some scientist who work on the fringe of science open a doorway to another dimension ( maybe hell ? ? ? ) and his daughter get sucked through it or something , then one day for no apparent reason she come back and now she ha big breast and wear a skimpy outfit ( I guess the demon in the other dimension made it for her ? ) The main character is a guy who want to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she 's more interested in her new girlfriend , and they stumble upon this witch spell book ( they want to be witch or something ? ? ? ) and the evil spell end up getting read again which is how the evil demon come to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently . There is topless scene for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend say is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary , obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fan will actually watch this pointless movie . I 'm sure the topless girl doe n't hurt there either . The extra feature on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie , I thought it might help explain what wa going on but it actually just made thing more confusing . Who are these people and what are they doing ? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of thing ( like the other dimension and book seller ) than make it confusing . I did n't like the movie but it wa only like five buck so big deal . I do n't recommend watching it though it wa just too stupid , I ca n't think of any part of the movie that wa good .",0
"Although I wa hoping that I 'd like it a little more , this wa still certainly an impressive film . There were great performance by all the lead , and the story , while not what I 'd call chilling , wa still effective and it kept me interested . For me , the best part of this film wa the look of the picture , for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well . I also thought that the low budget suited this movie , for I do n't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked a well in a film this grim . All thing considered , it fell a little short of my expectation , but I 'm still very glad that I finally sat down to watch this movie .",1
"Imagine this : a high school . Except it 's boarding school , and the kid do n't have parent around . Oh , and it 's in Malibu . And the kid are all thin , white , and gorgeous , with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the `` weird '' outcast . And there are n't any reasonable rule , like how they have co-habitation , nuclear weapon in their dorm , coffee stand , a sushi bar , and a complimentary laptop per student . Here 's the story : A girl , Zoey Brooks , attends PCA , a formerly all-boys school . Absolutely perfect in every possible way , she is smart , pretty , thin , athletic , creative , and everything a perfectionist want to be . Almost all the boy in school want her , and every girl want to be her friend . She 's the one everyone come to for advice , the one who save the day with a simplistic plan , and is just wonderful . Too bad none of this make her likable . Are we supposed to believe that if we do n't even come close to Zoey 's perfection , we 're bad people ? In the show , nothing 's her fault , and if anyone contradicts her , they 're portrayed a the bad guy ( Logan ) . He may be a jerk , but at least he ha some kind of brain that think for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time . Her loyal group of blind follower are : Chase , the average dumb as that ha a secret crush on her , Michael , the token black guy ( and the only decent actor on the set ) , Lola , a wannabe actress and anorexic , snobby airhead , Quinn , the smart but clueless girl when it come to teen stuff , and Logan , the rich jerk who ha a soft side . Yeah , this show basically spews out stereotype . What tick me off , though , is that they all try to pretend they 're normal kid . They complain that Logan get too much money while they have to work themselves , even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice thing that many teenager ca n't afford . They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis , hardly have homework , and suntan almost every day . Wow , they have it hard ! Any other problem ? I 'm too good-looking , rich , and stress-free ! I guess Zoey 101 ( what 's the 101 for , anyway ? ) is Nick 's attempt at trying to portray teen realistically . Except they caught a glimpse of reality , did n't like it , and decided to give the kid life like the ass on The Hills . But hey , at least the set 's pretty .",0
"I had been amazed by director Antal 's Kontroll back in 2003 . His first American project , Vacancy , wa le impressive but a decent start . Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable , the film never rise above the level of a B movie . It 's a shame because the main premise ha all the ingredient for twist and turn and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actor should be able to deliver . Antal could have made a great heist film but instead go for an action flick . Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doe n't really deliver in that department either . What you are left with is one implausible situation after another , a group of poorly sketched character bicker and fight over a sum of money . If you look past the sharp cinematography , cast and the tight music score , you 're left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal . This wa probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time .",0
"First of all , the reason I 'm giving this film 2 star instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance a Lieutenant Columbo . He alone can get 10 star for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie . I wa initially all fired up at reading one poster 's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave `` the performance of his career . '' To me , it wa the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie , and so I wa all prepared to hurl all sort of insult at the person who made the aforementioned comment . Then I thought to myself , what else ha Stevens done ? So I checked and , you know , that person wa absolutely right . In the 17 year since this Columbo movie wa made , apparently every one of the 33 project that Stevens ha been in since then ha been utter crap , so it is doubtful that anybody ha even seen the rest of his career . If you like Columbo , see every other of the 69 title before watching this one . Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last .",0
"This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in year . Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom . The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not , nothing is of any interest . The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , I just sat in utter amazement during this movie , thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining The producer of this movie were very clever . They made a boring movie but hid it well with the name of good actor and actress on their cast . People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think , Woody Harrison , Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie . ( boy are they in for a horrible time ) If you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie , some people actually did enjoyed this movie but I like to watch a movie with meaning",0
"Down at the Movie Gallery , I saw a flick I just had to see . It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into . Yeah , I knew it would suck , but I rented it anyway hoping for laugh . Only a few laugh were to be found . This wa an extremely stupid movie . It begin with a bounty hunter , our protagonist , who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film . He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris , but he ca n't . His dialogue suck too . Anyway , he go into a village , shoot some zombie . You could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scene where he take 3-5 minute to reload or watch some zombie . At least the zombie look cool . So anyway , some people get shot , some zombie die , and in the end , everyone is dead except our main character , who should have died at the beginning when he wa shot down by four people .",0
"i am finally seeing the El Padrino movie , from what I can see it is an incredible film , and lot of action Damian Chapa is good director , But I must admit I love his acting the Best . Also I saw the behind the scene it wa edited by some lady named kinga , she need to go back to school and learn how to edit . However the film El Padrino is a pure 10 action epic . Why cant most people who direct put together film that keep you wondering what the plot is ? I am so happy to see someone I know to be a real great actor become a great director also . I am one of those people who love to see artist make it . B.S .",1
I thrive on cinema .... but there is a limit . A NAME is n't enough to make A MOVIE ! . The beginning of the movie put u in a mood to expect the unseen yet .

The opportunity to make an outstanding movie wa there but the target wa totally missed . Next ...,0
"Michael Callan play a smarmy photographer who seems , nonetheless , to be regarded a a perfect `` catch '' by any woman that run across him ; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film ? He 's a `` hero '' whom it 's very difficult to empathize with , so the movie is in trouble right from the start . However , it 's trouble do n't end there . It ha the production value of a TV-movie ( check out that head made of clay or something , near the end ) , and the ending cheat in a way that I ca n't reveal , in case anyone want to see the movie ( highly unlikely ) . Let 's just say that the killer know more than we were let to know he know . ( * 1/2 )",0
"I wa drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston . I had no idea of the emotion and impact the movie would make . Recently I wa brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called `` Seasons '' , then I found the Elton John song `` Friends '' thinking it wa the same song ... it 's been 35 year of so . Anyway , the flood of the emotion of `` Friends '' came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love . I have more recall of the way the movie hit me than I do of the actual detail of the production , plot , etc . so forgive me for a rather poor review . I remember taking a couple of special friend on a date to see the movie and them being a moved and teary-eyed at the end a I wa . I 'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now . So many movie which seemed so important to me back then ( i.e . `` The Graduate '' `` Easy Rider '' ) now just seem silly and I do n't want this to fall into the same category . But , I will find it and if it turn out silly , then at least I 'll be able to turn my wife onto a great ... no .. outstanding soundtrack . When we met , we went through this with `` Last Tango in Paris '' . The youngster I work with ( I 'm 56 ) respect my opinion but it 's hard to explain the feeling of the sixty and the movie and song that reflect such strong feeling but seem a little `` aged '' now . I just ca n't figure out if the the aging process is the movie ... or me . `` Friends '' is a very special , sensitive and wonderful movie . It will bring back a lot of special feeling I 'm sure . By all mean , rent or buy a copy ... Indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today .",1
"During the Clete Roberts preface , I wa beginning to think this wa an Ed Wood production , however , what roll out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff . The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywood 's Poverty Row , and this make the movie all the more realistic . There are no punch pulled here , and at time the film is reminiscent of `` The Well '' ( 1951 ) . The Black and White texture give a newsreel-like quality . For certain , younger viewer will be reminded of `` The Blair Witch Project '' but this one IS based on REAL event !",1
"I decided to watch this one because it 's been nominated for Oscar this year . I guess a many folk here I really wanted to like this movie , but ended up bored and disappointed . First scene wa OK but the whole rest of the movie in `` shaky hand '' camera mode is really annoying . i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this : American `` military machine '' ( people , who make money on war ) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something ( sort of ) patriotic . why these `` heroic '' effort of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of `` loving-war-like-a-drug '' ? ..

"Mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movie out there called Mom or with the word Mom in the title . This is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that get churned out time after time and all end up much the same a every other zombie movie out there . It is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation . The kind old lady who take in a creepy lodger , who just happens to be a flesh eater , who then infects the old lady who also turn into a flesh eating zombie , or ghoul , quite which exactly is not defined . There is pathos in the story a her son realises what she ha become and while at first horrified , attempt to help her by supplying 'food ' . ( I shall say no more about that , for fear of inserting a spoiler ! ) It is one of those 'quiet ' movie a opposed to gun blasting , explosion raging , car chase , etc boring etc that make so many movie all the same rubbish , but still with enough gory moment to satisfy horror fan , whilst also inserting sadness into the story , along with nice touch of humour a opposed to downright silliness of some so-called 'horror ' movie . There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film , where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and look so 'innocent ' , but , what she becomes ! ! Oh my ! A gem of a movie and even if not your thing , should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan .",1
"Empire of Passion start out deceptively - that is , if you 're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie . It 's like a riff on James M. Cain 's The Postman Always Rings Twice , at first : Seki ( Kazuko Yoshiyuki ) is a mother of two and a dutiful , hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo ( Takahiro Tamura ) . But when he 's not around , and she 's at home with the baby , the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji ( Tatsuya Fuji ) come around to bring some goody for Seki ... and a little extra . They 're soon sleeping together , but after he doe something to her ( let 's just say a `` shave '' ) , he know that he 'll find out , and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo . They drink him up , strangle him , and then toss him down a well . Naturally , this will come back to haunt them - but that it 's literally , at least to them ( at first super-terrified Seki and then only later on skeptical Toyoji ) , change gear into the 'Kaidan ' , a Japanese ghost story . This is a film where the horror come not simply out of `` oh , ghost , ah '' , but out of the total dread that build for the character . In a way there 's the mechanic of a film-noir at work throughout , if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century Japanese village a opposed to an American city or small town ( i.e . the snooping cop , the `` evidence '' found possibly by another , word getting around , suspicion aroused , etc ) . It 's compelling because Seiko actually wa against the plan from the start , manipulated by the lustful but ill-prepared Toyoji , and her reaction to Gisaburo 's re-appearances are staggering to her . Take the one that come closest to poetry : Gisaburo 's ghost , pale-blue face and mostly silent , chilling stare , motion for Seiko to get on the rickshaw . She doe , reluctantly , and he push her around on a road she doe n't know , in the wee hour before dawn , surrounded by smoke . Most Japanese ghost story wish to heaven they could get this harrowingly atmospheric . While it start to veer into hysteric towards the end , there 's so much here that director Oshima get right in making this a distinctive work . After hitting it huge in the international cinema world with In the Realm of the Senses ( which , ironically , got banned in his own country ) , he made something that , he claimed , wa even * more * daring that 'Senses ' . Maybe he wa right ; Empire of Passion ha le graphic sexual content by far than it predecessor ( also starring Tatsuya Fuji , a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range ) , but it daring lie in crafting a world of dread . You can believe in ghost in this story , but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hell these two would-be lovebird will go . The snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worry : the fate of their very soul is at stake . And Oshima take what in other hand could be merely juicy pulp ( sadly , it would n't surprise me if an American remake wa already in the work ) and craft shot after gorgeous shot , with repetition working it way into the mis-en-scene ( i.e . the shot of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that road , the camera at a dutch angle , the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue ) a well a some affecting movement that will stay with me long after I finish typing this ( i.e . Toyoji throwing the leaf by one hand into the well in slow motion , or how Seiko 's nude body is revealed after she becomes blind ) . It 's daring lie in connecting on a level of the spirit- not to be confused with the spiritual , though there may be something with that a well- about life and death 's connection to one another , inextricably . It 's a classic waiting to be discovered .",1
"I am not a big music video fan . I think music video take away personal feeling about a particular song .. Any song . In other word , creative thinking go out the window .

"Oh , my goodness . I would have never thought it wa possible for me to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance this soon , but here it is . Armed with rotten plot , terrible editing , stilted acting , and headache-inducing 'style ' ( sorry , I have no other word for it ) , Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost force you to re-evaluate an entire genre ; that is , this film is so bad that even the thriller I condemned a complete failure now seem a little better . Now , not only Sanctimony is a terrible film in itself , it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movie and do a pathetic job with it . Right from the main title -- nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the one from Se7en -- I wa under the impression that something did n't smell quite right . As soon a the movie started with a series of corny , wanna-be hip quick-cuts full of gory image and bombastic color , I knew where that smell wa coming from . It turn out that two policeman , or rather policeman Jim Renart ( Michael Paré ) and policewoman Dorothy Smith ( Jennifer Rubin ) , are investigating on a murder spree in Vancouver . A serial killer , known a `` Monkey Killer '' ( what a menacing , chilling nickname , uh ? ) for his working method , ha killed quite a lot of people . You see , this nut apparently work following the proverb `` see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil '' and cut eye , ear , and tongue out of his victim . So far , six eye , six ear , and three tongue . In very ingenious fashion , Renart and Smith figure out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill other three people ... well , because he probably want to complete the number 666 . So suddenly the film focus on Tom Gerrick ( Casper Van Dien ) , a young , successful , good-looking businessman , with a dreadful temper . And that 's where the rip-off of American Psycho kick in . So we follow the life of the two police officer and the young psychopath , none of which is interesting in the least , until they finally meet . Along the way to that , a disco where Renart barely miss Gerrick unintentionally offer u one of the funniest scene in recent memory : Renart go in the back of the disco club , because ... well , just because the script tell u it 's a suspect place ; then , with one single punch in the stomach , Renard get rid of a big guard who block the path , and the guard is never heard of again ? Does this scene strike anyone else a completely unrealistic ? Anyway , after another murder , Gerrick turn in a a witness , but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer . In typical Basic Instinct fashion , Smith get some date with the young businessman , under the assumption that she might discover his true identity . I wo n't spoil the ending but it is , quite simply , an embarrassment ; there are contradiction , some plot hole , issue that never get resolved , and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder , supposed to be shocking and sad , come off a such laughably overdone and nonsensical that I frankly ca n't imagine how anyone could not laugh at it . At 87 minute , Sanctimony is really pushing it . You never care about one single character , because they are all so flat ( not to mention boring ) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them . You are never pulled into the story , because the scene are connected through weak plot device when not downright unnecessary and out of place . The acting range from average ( Van Dien ) to downright atrocious ( Rubin , and most of the supporting cast ) ; the music is abysmal generic techno , and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen . Of course , like every fiasco of the genre , we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity . 3/10",0
"The Man With a Golden Arm wa one of a trio of great film around that same time that dealt with drug addiction . The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain . But I think of the three this one is the best . Maybe if Otto Preminger had shot the thing in the real Chicago instead of those obvious studio set the film might have been better yet . Who know , maybe Preminger could n't get enough money to pay for the location . It 's the only flaw I find in the film . Frank Sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who wa busted for covering for his bos Robert Strauss when the game wa raided . He took the cure while in jail and want a new life a a jazz drummer . But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him . First Bob Strauss who want him back dealing , especially because a couple of heavyweight gambler are in town . He us a few underhanded method to get Sinatra 's service back . Secondly Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who want Sinatra good and hooked a a customer again . And finally Eleanor Parker his clinging wife who 's working a con game to beat all , just to keep him around . Frank Sinatra got a nomination for Best Actor for this film , but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty . Sinatra might have won for this one if he had n't won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actor category a few year back and that Marty wa such an acclaimed film in that year . His scene going through withdrawal locked up in Kim Novak 's apartment will leave you shaken . Eleanor Parker doe not get enough credit for her role . She 's really something a the crazy scheming wife who want Sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost . If she had not been nominated that same year for Interrupted Melody , she might have been nominated for this . 1955 marked the high point of her career . Darren McGavin got his first real notice a the very serpentine drug peddler . His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl . Elmer Bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak Chicago neighborhood the character live in . Not a place you 'd want to bring up your family .",1
"This film wa basically set up for failure by the studio . One , Anne Rice ( author of the book ) offered to write the screen play but wa refused by the studio . Two , they tried to stuff 2 in depth novel in to a 2hour movie . I maintain the only way for these two book -Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series . First off the the Vampire Lestat alone take place from the 1700 's to the 1980 's and ha a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character , Lestat . The entire book Vampire Lestat set up the event of the second part Queen of the Damned . Without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed . Lestat wa not cruel and vicious to all , he wa not wanting to go along with Akasha 's plan , Marius did not make Lestat , Lestat did not love Jesse or make her , Lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light , Marius wa not after David nor the other way around , every character wa completely represented wrong , BASICALLY same name different story . If they wanted to make a vampire movie , fine . Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novel , fine . But do n't piggie back into the theater off the success of Rice 's great novel and character just to destroy what her loyal reader have come to love . If you have n't read the book you wo n't understand the film really , if you have read the book you will be insulted . That being said , I am such a huge fan I had to see the movie knowing full well this wa going to be the case and still went for it . Catch 22 , must see it , will hate it .",0
"Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flick and I had expected a lot more , even from a score of 5.8 IMDb , the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal , the acting is most unfortunately thinner and go to mimic a `` worst case scenario '' of playing `` strong '' feeling accompanied by some bad acting ... Do n't waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining , if you wan na cry it might suffice though , even though your tear will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy ... I give this 2/10 it really wa awful , if you wan na see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it , it all the good thing this movie is n't .",0

"Do n't listen to most of these people . ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love ! Its about Jill Johnson , played by Camilla Belle , who babysits at the Mendrakis ' house and someone break in . if you 're wondering how he got in the house , he went through the garage most likely . so anyway , do n't listen to , `` the worst acting '' . it ha amazing acting . with a great story .

I 'm a future movie critic . i totally want to buy this movie . and you will too when you see it . it is amazingly awesome .",1
"What a frustrating movie . A small Southern town is overflowing with possibility for exploring the complexity of interpersonal relationship and dark underbelly hidden beneath placid surface , a anyone who ha read anything by Carson McCullers already know . This doe none of that . Instead , the writer settled for cutesy twinkle , cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama . The thing look like a made-for-TV movie , and wa directed with no particular distinction , but it 's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting . The most frustrating aspect , though , is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actor in this cast , all trying gamely to make the best of thing and do what they can with this -- well , there 's no other word for it -- drivel . A tragic waste of talent , in particular that of the great Stockard Channing .",0
"This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s , Jack Pearl ( radio 's `` Baron Munchausen '' ) a well a Jimmy Durante . However , 7-1/2 decade later , it 's being billed a a Three Stooges film because they are the only one in the film who the average person would recognize today . Film fanatic will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver a well a Zazu Pitts . As for the Stooges , this is a film from there very early day -- before MGM had any idea what to do with the team . At this point , they were known a `` Ted Healy and his Stooges '' a Healy wa the front man . Fortunately for the Stooges , they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man ( read up on him -- you 'll see what I mean ) and the rest is history . Within a year , they were making very successful short for Columbia and executive at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team . This sort of thing wa a common occurrence at MGM , a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy ( such a the film of Buster Keaton , Laurel and Hardy , Abbott and Costello and others ) . In fact , up until they left for Columbia , MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film role -- including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY . And , oddly , in this film they did n't act a a team -- they just did various supporting role , such a Larry playing the piano ! This particular film begin with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle . When they are rescued and brought home , all sense of structure to the film fall apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show -- punctuated by scene with the lead here and there . As for Pearl , I could really see why he never made a successful transition to film , a he ha the personality of a slug ( but slightly le welcome ) . As for Durante , I never knew what the public saw in him -- a least a far a his film are concerned -- he wa loud and ... loud ! He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keaton 's career to make this film . Together , Pearl and Durante rely on lot of verbal humor ( ? ) and Vaudeville-style routine that tend to fall rather flat . In this film , the Stooges they did n't yet have the right chemistry . Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later film is odd . What they did in the film wa pretty good , but because all the segment were short , they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routine . Stooges fan might be very frustrated at this , though die-hard fan may want to see this so that they can complete their life-long goal of seeing everything Stooge -- even the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser film ( oh , and did they got bad after the death of Shemp and Curly ) . Overall , the film is rather dull and disappointing . However , there are a couple interesting thing to look for in the mess . At about the 13 minute mark , you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing . Look carefully , a this is Walter Brennan in a role you 'd certainly never expect ! Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the `` Clean a a Whistle '' song starting at about 22 minute into the film . This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called `` Pre-Code '' scene that never would have been allowed in film after 1934 ( when the Production Code wa strengthened ) . Despite the word `` Clean '' in the title , it 's a very titillating number with naked woman showing lot of flesh -- enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything ! It 's quite shocking when seen today , though such excess were pretty common in the early 1930s . Finally , at the 63 minute mark , see Jimmy Durante set race relation back a few decade . See the film , you 'll see that I mean !",0
"When Carol ( Vanessa Hidalgo ) start looking into her brother 's death , she begin to suspect something more sinister than `` natural cause '' . The closer she get to the truth , the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law , Fiona ( Helga Line ) , and the rest of the local Satanists . They 'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy way . If you 're into sleazy , Satanic-themed movie , Black Candles ha a lot to offer . The movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex . One scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed . Unfortunately , all the sleaze in the world ca n't save Black Candles . Most of the movie is a total bore . Other than the one scene I 've already mentioned , the numerous sex scene are n't shocking and certainly are n't sexy . The acting is spotty at best . Even genre favorite Helga Line give a disappointing performance . The plot really doe n't matter . Its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scene together . I 'm only familiar with one other movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz . Compared with his Daughters of Darkness that masterfully mix eroticism and horror , Black Candles come off a amateurish . 3/10 is about the best I can do .",0
"One of the more intelligent serial killer movie in recent history . ZODIAC KILLER offer an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killer . The filmmaker create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer , and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued . Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal . Unlike many serial killer , Zodiac wa not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter . The director here play viewer expectation and pull it off . The film is constructed a a murder mystery , or a `` cold case '' -style thriller . It is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrill . Some people dislike any movie that is shot on video . This attitude is very old-style and provincial . It is an attitude and view of movie that put technical issue above entertainment value or artistic value . These attitude are on the way out . ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film , no doubt , but discerning viewer will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem .",1
"I 've read the other review and found some to be comparison of movie v real life ( eg what it take to get into music school ) , Britney Bashing , etc , etc . so let 's focus on the movie and the message . I have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 year , and for a family movie . For the average adult male .... 2 out of 10 . I like pop/rock music , i 'm 45 . I know of Britney Spears but never realised she actually sang Stronger until i read the credit and these review . I did n't recognise her poster on the wall so I wa not worried about any 'self promotion ' . I watch movie to be entertained . i do n't care about casting , lighting , producer , director , etc . What is the movie and doe it entertain me . I watched this movie for the message . The world 's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem ( which is a whole other story ) so watched with the message in mind , a that is an area of interest . The movie is light , bright and breezy , great for kid . I found the Texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many way to convey the give up/do n't give up message , so yeh , it wa a bit predictable . Great message though ... should be more of them . This movie is a great family movie , but for a bloke watching by himself , get Hannibal .",1
"I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema , made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movie . It is filled with Super-surfer Greg Noll 's home movie , and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion . Nevertheless , it ha been expanded to the degree that it approach aesthetic glory . It is filled with artistic talent , and athletic talent , however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic . Surfers are not astronaut nor test-pilots . Nor are they surgeon ( perhaps ) or Ph.d 's ( again , perhaps ) . It belief in the quest of the surfer . It belief in the beauty of human goofiness . It belief in the great gift of peace , which come from the cessation of war . Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zero fifteen year before . It celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the Russian socialist . Surfing is the ultimate narcissism . It is dangerous , but only slightly historical . I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique . He had to go out and conquer a few dozen country to get the favorable press he ha received . This movie ha no military hero . It ha no gun . The only beach-head surfer conquer ha a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop . This is not a problem . Peace is not desperate . It is the joy of exhalation .",1
"I had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode . It wa dumbed down to such an extent , I doubt if I learned a single thing . The graphic were rudimentary . Any small idea wa repeated ad nauseum . Contrast this to the Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan . That had a good musical theme . There wa NO music coming from these infernal 10-dimensional Strings .",0
"Although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched , it is worth seeing just for the performance of Michaels Caine and Gambon . The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent . Caine ham it up ... which is exactly what the character he is playing should do . Entertaining and fun , this is a hour and a half of easy watching .",1
"This movie wa so badly written , directed and acted that it beggar belief . It should be remade with a better script , director and casting service . The worst problem is the acting . You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand who is polished , professional and totally believable , and on the other hand , Ri'chard , who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece . Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful a the slave owning ( and keeping ) couple , although both normally do fine work . The actor ( and director ) should not have attempted to do accent at all -- they are inconsistent and unbelievable . Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English . The casting is ludicrous . Why have child of an `` African '' merchant ( thus le socially desirable to the gen de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actor , while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel , ha pronounced African feature , including an obviously dyed blond `` fro '' ? It 's a if the casting director can not be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actor from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actor of color . It 's just so weird ! This could be a great movie and should be re-made , but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actor . There are plenty of good actor out there , and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals , Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast , good script and decent direction .",0
"When I wa a younger ( oh about 2 ) I watched Barney for the first time , and liked it . BUT , back then I did n't exactly have a brain , either . And now I look back and see what a horrible show `` Barney '' really is : First of all , EVERYTHING on that show is creepy . Barney , the main character , is a horrendous 9-foot tall talking , purple dinosaur that teach 13-year-olds about `` imagination .... '' ( * shudder * ) B.J . ( I know what your thinking about his name . ) Is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be `` supposudly '' cool . But in fact , he is the exact opposite . After watching a few episode with B.J . dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap , and making a few no-so-funny joke , I wanted to scream . Baby Bop-oh-oh-god ! ( * vomit * ) oh-oh-OH-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of a character EVER . She is a green triceratops ( it 's a dinosaur ) that carry a yellow blanket . Her remark of `` hee-hee-hee '' and Barney 's praise cry of 'super-deeee-doooper '' , make it hard to sit through each episode , a the Seventh grader learn about shape and manner . And that , my friend , is what make this show truly horrible .",0
"Steve McQueen ha certainly a lot of loyal fan out there . He certainly wa a charismatic fellow , one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew . But even McQueen ca n't save this turkey of a film , shot with what look like a brownie camera in the actual location in St. Louis . McQueen 's a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang . There 's more than a broad hint that there 's a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke . He 's not liked at all by the other heist member , mainly because of his lack of criminal resume . Steve also ha a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspect something afoot , especially when he start hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas a well a Clarke , all pretty rough character . That would certainly get my suspicion aroused . The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two director Charles Guggenheim and John Stix . Guggenheim did mostly documentary and Stix did n't do much of anything . One of those two joker decided Steve 's performance wa best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation . This film may go down a the worst ever done by Steve McQueen . I 'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I ca n't believe they would have if they saw this . Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey .",0
"This is a bad film , a it central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it wa the result of merging several disparate script . As a result , it often make absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making . However , the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of `` Pre-Code '' film because it feature an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly say that nice girl DO put out -- even if they are n't married and even if their partner IS ! ! The film begin with Miss Dunne a a social worker assisting troop heading to Europe for WWI . In the process , she meet a scalawag ( Bruce Cabot ) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him . She becomes pregnant and he then go on to the next unsuspecting woman . However , Miss Dunne doe NOT want him back , a she realizes he 's not worth it , but later her baby dy at child birth . While all these very controversial plot element are used , they are always alluded to -- almost like they wanted the adult in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way , kid in the audience will be clueless ( after all , film were not rated and kid might attend any film at this time ) . Surprisingly , this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot end about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to . It wa a if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it -- tacking it on to still another film . In this second phase of the film , Miss Dunne unexpectedly begin working at a woman 's prison ( though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there ) . What we do see are countless horrible scene of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate . And , a a result of all this violence , Miss Dunne go on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer . But then , out of the blue , another type of film emerges and the woman 's prison reform business go by the wayside . Dunne meet a judge ( Walter Huston ) who is married but he desperately want her . Now throughout the film , Dunne is portrayed a a very good girl -- even though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot ( she wa more or le tricked into it ) . But now , single Irene , who is a tireless reformer and good lady begin sleeping with a married man . He tell her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only , but she never think to investigate if this is true , and with his assurance , off fly her clothes and they are in the baby making business ! BUT , while she 's pregnant with his love child , he 's indicted for being a crooked judge . He assures her he 's innocent , but he 's convicted and it sure sound like he 's a scoundrel -- using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune . Then , in the final moment of the film , Miss Dunne try in vain to get him freed and vow to wait with the child until Huston is released . The film then end . So , we basically have three separate film AND a bizarre early 30 idea of what a nice girl should be like . I gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationship ! This really undoes all the positive about Dunne 's character and it 's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film . A strong woman 's right advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she wa and religious people might see her a totally amoral or at least morally suspect ! With a decent re-write , this could have been a good film or at least interesting a a lewd and salacious film , but it could n't make up it mind WHAT it wanted to be and wa just another dull Pre-Code film .",0
"I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently . It actually turned out to be pretty decent a far a B-list horror/suspense film go . Two guy ( one naive and one loud mouthed a * * ) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky , make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them . Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker . What make this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie , unlike so many others . The two guy are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scene . Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff . Definitely worth checking out .",1
"( Very mild spoiler ; a basic plot outline , no real detail ) IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectation . I saw this film at a free screening a few day ago in Maryland , and the only reason I agreed to go ... wa because it wa free . I expected a few chuckle , but a I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D , not much more then that . The first ten minute of the film are hilarious , a we are given a look at Jack Black 's humble Christian origin in a Midwest American town . The film then take u year into the future , to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass , the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of it name . Finally , a the title suggests , the second half of the film detail their quest to obtain the fabled `` Pick of Destiny . '' Again , the beginning of the film wa laugh out loud funny , and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face . That said , there were time it felt a bit long ; it 's only 100 minute , but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter . The story is every bit a absurd a it sound , and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot . Which is fine , except it mean that many of the joke are very hit or miss ... and when they miss , they miss bad . Same thing with the song ; it is a musical , but many of the song lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then kept going anyway . I will say that the R-rating really saved this movie from bombing ; The D 's humor simply could n't work without cussing , sex , and drug reference . But unless you 're a real fan of the band , or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy , I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent . `` Pick '' will make you giggle a bit ... but is it worth 9 buck ? I do n't think so . I wa tempted to rate it a 6 , but since I do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatre , a 7 seems more appropriate . Just be sure it 's your style .",1
"I shall begin with a disclaimer : This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played FF7 the game before watching . The movie relies on the audience 's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot element . And it doe so very subtly . Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise it 'll be that much better . With that in mind , this film ha some of the most spectacular CG sequence I have ever witnessed . The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game , on steroid . Yeah . The attention to detail in each scene , especially in the heavy action oriented one , is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe . I believe the soundtrack is simplified so a to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music . Again , for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background , the music should not surprise anyone ( although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation ) . Once again , I myself having only played through FF7 once , thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix . And that is the feel in most scene , choreographed and organized . Like a dance . In short , if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7 , this film will blow you out of the water . If you 're in the unfortunate majority who ha not experienced the goodness known a FF7 on Playstation or PC , doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience . Finally , I just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film . Characters move with fluidity . Each scene background come to life and tell it own story . For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot , I urge you to reexamine the animation . Facial reaction , subtle clue that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery . Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura ha set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling . Advent Children ha ushered in a new era for CG animation , allowing the subtlety that lie in each character to speak volume in and of themselves . Thanks Square Enix . The wait wa well worth it .",1
"This is quite possibly one of the worst movie ever made . Everything about it -- acting , directing , script , cinematography -- is dreadful . The alien ( a human in sparkly suit ) claim to be from a nearby universe ; one assumes the scriptwriter meant `` galaxy '' but did n't bother to get a dictionary to check his term . A better title for the film would be `` It Came From the Planet of Plot Contrivances . '' The plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent . The human are all given magical MacGuffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restriction just to move the bare plot . Any thought to the passage of time is ignored . Now it 's a couple day after meeting the alien , then BAM ! all of a sudden there 's only a couple hour left until zero hour . Do yourself a favor and miss this movie . You will make yourself stupider for having watched it . The ending is particularly silly , and should have been accompanied by someone going `` Ta-Da ! ! ! ! '' a the scriptwriter just pull something random out of his butt . I think the real alien plot is that this movie suck so bad you 'll get cancer watching it . If you can watch the last 10 minute without crapping yourself ( `` enemy of freedom '' -- honestly ) laughing , you 're retarded .",0
"If you really really REALLY enjoy movie featuring ant building dirt-mirrors , eating non-ants , and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative , then this is the movie for you . Basically , a couple of scientist working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ant ( the most intelligent actor in this film ) in an attempt to try to thwart their plan of conquest and extermination . Throughout the movie the two scientist ( and a girl they rescued from the ant ) use everything at their disposal ( computer , green dye , and horrid acting ) , but to no avail . I guess they just could n't afford any pesticide because the movie would be over too quickly . The title of the movie `` Phase IV '' is something of a mystery . This is not a spoiler , but `` Phase I '' start right after the opening credit whereas you do n't reach `` Phase IV '' until the end credit roll . Apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed Phases 1 - 3 throughout the movie a a kind of progress report : `` Hang in there buddy ! Only 1 more phase until final credit ! '' As a MST3K episode , this one wa n't very good for two reason : 1 ) This one is from the Season 0 on KTMA when they were first starting out so the riffing is not a good a in later season ; and 2 ) This movie is so bad not even J & TB can lighten it up . There are one or two Gamera reference a they had just finished riffing 5 Gamera movie . The movie doe have a trick/surprise ending , but I wa so glad to reach the end the effect wa lost on me .",0

"From director Barbet Schroder ( Reversal of Fortune ) , I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class , and I recognised the leading actress , so I tried it , despite the rating by the critic . Basically cool kid Richard Haywood ( Half Nelson 's Ryan Gosling ) and Justin Pendleton ( Bully 's Michael Pitt ) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them . Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie 'The Hyena ' Mayweather ( Sandra Bullock ) with new partner Sam Kennedy ( Ben Chaplin ) , who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene , e.g . non-relating hair . The plan doe n't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin a suspect , it is just a question of if they can sway them away . Also starring Agnes Bruckner a Lisa Mills , Chris Penn a Ray Feathers , R.D . Call a Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica a Asst . D.A . Al Swanson . I can see now the same concept a Sir Alfred Hitchcock 's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing , but this film doe it in a very silly way , and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable . Adequate !",0
"Things to Come is an early Sci-Fi film that show an imagined world , or `` Everytown '' through 100 year . You can break it up into about 4 different scene or part . The film span from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the `` Boss '' wanted to get the capability to fly in airplane again , after Everytown wa bombed and war broke out . This film only ha about 3 fault : it 's audio is muddy and video had some quirk , the character are n't deep at all , and the overall plot is n't altogether solid . The plot is lacking something that I ca n't put my finger on ... it just seems a little `` fluffy . '' But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H.G . Wells though might happened in the next hundred year , this is a must see . It 's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone wa fearing : a long , drawn-out war , because they were just about to go to war with Germany , and there wa a threat of biological weapon and everything . Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once .",1
"Weak , stale , tired , cliched ; want to be Basic Instinct , but miss opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspective , new insight . Insipid , trite , grotesque , and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity ; oh , wait ... it wa only 90 minute long ... it must have just * seemed * a lot longer ! I 'd rather clean bus station toilet with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again . I 'm expressing an opinion here : I guess this mean I did n't like it .",0
"One word can describe this movie and that is weird . I recorded this movie one day because it wa a Japanese animation and it wa old so I thought it would be interesting . Well it wa , the movie is about a young boy who travel the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge . On the way he meet very colorful character and must ultimately decide if he want the body or not . Very strange , if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out .",1
"While i wa the video store i wa browsing through the one dollar rental and came upon this little gem .

One of the girl is Alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle . Thrown together by fate , they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on . I just hate it when amazing movie fall through the crack . Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast ! My only complaint is that the DVD wa sorely lacking in special feature . Oh and some of the jump cut in the movie were kind of jarring . But all in all a excellent movie .",1
"this film is quite simply one of the worst film ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hack at work today . Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also feature a good cast of British actor , so what went wrong ? i do n't know and simply i do n't care enough to engage with the debate because the film wa so terrible it deserves no thought at all . be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish . but apparently i need to write ten line of text in this review so i might a well detail the plot . A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father 's company and thus lead to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accent and stupid , very stupid plot twists/devices . i should have asked for my money back but wa perhaps still in shock from the experience . if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspect or the godfather , what about lock , stock .... thats the peak of the contemporary British crime film .....",0
"I 'll not comment a lot , what 's to ? ? ? Stereotype character , absolute ignorance about Colombia 's reality , awful mise en scene , poor color choice , NOT funny ( it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it 's beside the nonsense scene ) , Very poor actor direction ( if you see somewhere those people , I mean the interpreter , you 'll know they are at least good , but seeing this so call film , it is impossible to guess it ) , you get tired of the music ... this `` comedy '' ha no rhythm , the only good rhythm in it , it 's the rap sing in the final credit .... pathetic , doe n't it ? etc ... etc ... It ha been a long time I have n't seen a movie so bad ! !",0
"This movie is a riot . I can not remember the last time I had such a great time at the movie . I 've seen a few good comedy in my time and usually they are pretty funny . But this one is wall to wall great line . I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in . The movie wa non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minute of sentimental plot clean up . Other than that it 's a constant barrage of one liner and goofy situation . I 'd like to see it again before it leaf the theater because this is like the Zucker movie where you do n't get all the joke the first time around . You have to see it two or three time to get it all in . As far a the actual film go , it could have used a better edit , it 's choppy at time but we have to be forgiving for that . All the character are great . It 's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he try to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke . I think I will remember all the main character for year to come because they are all so likable . No victim in this movie . Also , thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend . Catherine Keener play her and she is a sweetheart in this film . You just wish that woman like her really existed . She 's not a `` 10 '' like some of the other leading lady but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite . If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it . I assure you , the trailer doe not do it justice . They do not give away all the good joke . Just some of the mediocre one . Oh and one more thing . I hope critic put this on their top ten list . Many of them complain that comedy do n't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they do n't put it on their list . This mean you Ebert ! ! !",1
"A fey story of a Martian attempt to colonize Earth . ( Things must be pretty bad back on Mars . ) Two state trooper investigate the scene of a reported UFO crash . Whatever landed is buried under the ice at Tracy 's Pond but there are footstep in the snow leading to a nearby diner . The diner ha had no customer since eleven o'clock that morning . Now there are a handful of bus passenger sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge . The bus driver insists that six passenger were aboard the bus , although he did n't notice who they were . The problem is that there are now SEVEN people waiting for the journey to be resumed . One of them is an alien , but which one ? All of them are suspect . There 's the crazy old man ( Jack Elam ) , of course , who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit . There 's a blustering businessman who must get to Boston ( John Hoyt ) . A young couple on their honeymoon . ( Execrable performance by the husband , Ron Kipling . ) Except for the couple , nobody ha noticed anyone else . And even the couple are suspicious of each other . Bride to newly minted husband : `` I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin . '' The story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone ring for no reason , the light go on and off , the juke box turn itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously . It 's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle . There is no discernible `` depth '' to it . It 's not a moral message about pod people masquerading a normal citizen . It 's not a warning of any kind , just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses . I always enjoy it when it 's on . It 's especially interesting to see John Hoyt a the irritable and impatient businessman , knowing that in 1954 he wa the Roman Senator who masterminded the assassination of Julius Caesar in MGM 's version of Shakespeare 's play . And here he is -- with three arm . Oops .",1
"It 's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site , but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it wa created , and how bias it product wa . I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family a boorish and untrustworthy . We hear them discus the sadness that they feel from oppression , yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population . We see no evidence that parallel the position of the Palestinian teenager . We only hear from other Palestinians in prison . I understand restriction are in place , but the political nature of the restriction are designed to prevent peace . I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim wa selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence , so to speak . She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber 's parent , and her angry and closed-minded word caused the final meeting to spiral out of control . It is more realistic , in my mind , to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ; ignored plea for understanding and freedom , ignored request for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land . I have given this a two because of these selfish weakness of the mother , which normally would be admirable in a documentary , however in the light of the lack of impartiality , it all seems exploitative . Also for the poor edits , lack of background in the actual instance , and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side . Ultimately , it is a poor documentary and a poor film . I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation , but am obliged to note the flaw in direction regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter .",0
"Relentless like one of those loud action movie . The entire cast seems to be on speed . I did n't quite get the director 's intention if any . I wonder if she 's ever seen a Stanley Donen , Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical . Structure , please ! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba . The costume the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actor but loving towards the location ) The one thing that make the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself . No chemistry with her friend ( Christine Baranski and Julie Walters ) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you 'll understand what I wa hoping for . I wa embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth . The audience , however , seemed to enjoy it so it probably it 's just me .",0
"This movie doe a great job of explaining the problem that we faced and the fear that we had before we put man into space . As a history of space flight , it is still used today in classroom that can get one of the rare print of it . Disney ha shown it on `` Vault Disney '' and I wish they would do so again .",1
"In an alternate 1950s , where an outbreak of the undead ( caused by a mysterious 'space-dust ' ) ha been contained through the use of special electronic collar , a young loner , Timmy , find a friend in Fido ( Billy Connelly ) , his family 's recently acquired domesticated zombie . Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy , whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son ( or for his hot-to-trot wife , played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss ) having been psychologically scarred a a child ( when he wa forced to shoot his own father , who tried to eat him ! ) . Timmy run into a spot of bother , however , when his putrid pal 's collar go on the blink , and he attack and kill an elderly neighbour . With the authority on Fido 's trail , trouble brewing with a pair of local bully , and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help , will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend ? A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick , Fido is a thoroughly entertaining , deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour . Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius , and the result is simply one of the most original film to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead ' theme that I have seen . Connelly 's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame , along with Day Of The Dead 's Bub , and Return Of The Living Dead 's Tarman ; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse , but The Big Yin 's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pu ! The rest of the cast also give commendable performance , with young K'Sun Ray ( a Timmy ) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentionsRay , because , for one so young , he put in a particularly assured turn , and Moss because she is so bloody yummy ! This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week ( the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead ) , and , to my surprise , it is also the best . Director Andrew Currie ha given fan of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future . 8.5 out of 10 , rounded up to 9 for IMDb .",1
"An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up star needed here a all cast member were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60 's and 70 's West . But hat off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think wa his signature performance , especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life . His role went far beyond the mere clown role a he deeply dealt with all the `` ups and down '' of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surround such a life style . He and Mr. Coburn teamed up extremely well a partner , not only on the circuit itself , but also in the real world outside the corral . Also , check out Anne Archer a Coburn 's Native American love interest in the latter part of the movie . Must have been one of her first role . Not a flashy , perhaps , a `` Junior Bonner '' , but equally heart rendering and impacting in it portrayal . Thanks to the Encore Western Channel for showing this true grit of an under-rated movie from time to time .",1
"Despite some review being distinctly Luke-warm , I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critic have described the love story a 'Mills and Boon ' , so what ? It is good to see a warm , touching story of real love in these cynical time . Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eye . You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other , even though , for political reason , it wa an arranged marriage . I did feel though that Sir John Conroy , who wa desperate to control the young Queen , is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain . As it is rumoured that he wa in fact , the real father of Victoria ( a a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent ) it would have been interesting to explore this theory . Emily Blunt is totally convincing a the young Princess , trapped in the stifling palace with courtier and politician out to manipulate her . She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England , which prospered a never before , under her long reign . I believe word of mouth recommendation will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie .",1
"`` American Nightmare '' is officially tied , in my opinion , with `` It 's Pat ! '' for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME . Seven friend ( oddly resembling the K-Mart version of the cast of `` Friends '' ) gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare , a pirate radio show . It 's hosted by a guy with a beard . That 's the most exciting aspect of his show . Chandler , Monica , Joey , and ... oh wait , I mean , Wayne , Jessie , and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turn revealing their biggest fear to the bearded DJ . Unbeknownst to them , a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening ... Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait , sorry again ... by making their fear come to life . These fear include such stunner a `` voodoo '' and being gone down on by old lady with denture . No . Really . This movie wa , in a word , rotten . Crazy Nurse 's killing spree lack motivation , there 's nothing to make the viewer `` jump , '' the ending blow , and -- again -- voodoo ? If you have absolutely no regard for your loved one , rent `` American Nightmare '' with them . If you care for your loved one -- even a little bit -- go to your local Blockbuster , rent all of the copy of `` American Nightmare '' and hide them in your freezer .",0
"First off , I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm . I read it with my 9th grade class , and it wa great . We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial . The movie wa so disappointing to me . The movie cut out some character , and miss a lot of the main point of the book . It skip around a lot , and doe n't explain anything in detail . If someone wa watching this movie without having first read the book , they would be confused . The most disappointing thing in this movie to me , wa the ending . The ending in the book wa the most powerful , and in the movie , they changed it ! It wa supposed to be the pig and men in an alliance and sort of `` melting '' together , but instead , the movie made it seem like the animal were going to rebel against the pig . To sum up , I do n't think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book .",0
"This movie wa extremely boring . I only laughed a few time . I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner 's name on the cover . It 's all about this little kid who get picked on all the time by his classmate . When wandering the street looking for old lady to assist , he meet a prostitute . She take him to a club called the Playground , where he befriends several pimp . When mayor Tony Gold ( Shatner ) decides to take over the pimp business , Lil ' Pimp must lay down for his homies . The animation is n't very good in this . It look like it wa made with Macromedia , which I 'm sure it wa . It doe n't suck , it 's just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent year . The humor in this is not very good , I did n't think any of it wa funny .",0
"I wa disgusted by this movie . No it wa n't because of the graphic sex scene , it wa because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi . This movie doe not hold much truth about her and her art . It show one piece of art work that she did ( Judith Beheading Holofernese ) but show that being entered a testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial . I do n't know if you understood this from the movie , probably not , Tassi wa not a noble character . He RAPED Artemisia . It wa not love , it wa rape . He did not claim to accept false charge of rape to stop her from suffering while she wa tortured . According to the rape transcript he continued to claim that he never carnally knew Artemisia ( aka had sex with ) while she state over and over again `` It 's true '' . I encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real Artemisia and see what she is really about . Do n't base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie . I encourage you to do some research , Artemisia really doe have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work . Do n't see the movie , but find out the true story of Artemisia .",0
"Such a joyous world ha been created for u in Pixar 's A Bug 's Life ; we 're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film , but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation . For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it 's in the right hand that is  A Bug 's Life is a warm reminder . We walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling , and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film production . It is only Pixar 's second animated feature . The sub-group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three year prior in 1995 , with their landmark movie Toy Story . It wa a movie which defied convention , re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence . Now , they return with their sophomore effort which , to be honest , draw a creeping sense of cynicism in u all prior to seeing the film . After all , it 's a film about ant . Well , all walk of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug 's Life , but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film , a human are the focal point in drama , romance and so on . How can such an insignificant specie of animal such a an ant act a the protagonist of a movie , let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film ? Surely they jest . However , we forget that in Toy Story , a bunch of toy-box item were able to become the grandest , most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated hero and villain ever concocted . The guy at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat , and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bug into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you 'll probably ever encounter . Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there is n't an unpleasant character in sight ; even the villain are riveting character  but they 're colourful , they 're eclectic , and they 're idiosyncratic . And the array of character is also gargantuan for lack of a better term , only adding the rich layer of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug 's Life from the beginning . We shall start with our main character , and our hero . His name is Flik ( David Foley ) , and his character is rather generic to say the least . Out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant residing on the lush , beautiful Ant Island , he is the one considered the 'black sheep ' of the clan , a seen in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season 's harvest with his antic . The problem arises in the fact that the ant ' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshopper led by Hopper ( Kevin Spacey ) , who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant ; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone , they go insane , for lack of a better term . Hopper offer a proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack 's hand ; however , it 's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil . The cog and clockwork in Flik 's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame , and he offer to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony 's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshopper . If you think about it , A Bug 's Life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line 's of Akira Kurosawa 's classic Seven Samurai , or the American remake The Magnificent Seven , in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemy  one lone village-dweller go in search for help in the big city , find it and return to the colony to drive off evil . In A Bug 's Life , the help come in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik a warrior in a bar-room brawl . Much amusement come out of these scene , and much amusement come out of these circus troupe bug . Among them are an erudite stick insect ( David Hyde Pierce ) , a side-splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who 's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug ( Dennis Hopper ) . It 's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bug on-screen , a it is watching the bug and the insect interact on-screen , a is the entire movie collectively . As I 've said , much amusement and mirth come out of their character and joyous interaction with one another , which give way to a bevy of hilarious line , wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situation and overall a dazzling movie . What make A Bug 's Life even better is that the film is n't restricted simply to child a many may perceive it to be , although child would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid-friendly situation are a bit more abundant than we 'd like . However , it 's easy to ignore this fault , and it 's incredulously easy to enjoy this film . Although A Bug 's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standard set by it predecessor , this is still a superb movie , and the start of something promising here . Pixar have proved that they 're not just a one-hit wonder , but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artist in Hollywood . They raise the bar endlessly , and when someone always manages to top their standard , it 's only always by themselves . What more is there to say about A Bug 's Life other than : see it ; it 's not quite the best which we 've seen from the folk at Emeryville , California , but this beat out the lot of it year  and I 'll be damned if this is n't the best animated feature of 1998 . 8.5/10",1
What an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel . I do wish people would stop messing about with classic when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original . This version is no different . I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse though a the casting of Juliette brioche a Kathy ha got to be the worst casting decision EVER ... anyway back to this version . It aim to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style . It succeeds in both but high art it is nit . Throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe ... The direction wa average and the editing abysmal . Worse than the old Quincy . Deepak Verma doe a great turn a Hindley and is in fact one of Britains wasted talent . The part of Heath wa played with great charm and belief and I think that the casting is the strongest point of this project . Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facility he had . Its clear that he wa a director for hire and did n't instill the project with the passion that it deserved .,0
"My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I wa Younger . It 's about Andre , a divorced french man who want to take his beautiful daughter ( katharine heigl } on a vacation , hoping to get a little closer to her . But of course , Nicole is n't that easy to get along with , she just started puberty , i 'm guessing . She is angry and hurt that her father wa never there for her and decides to give him a hard time . One day at the beach , Nicole meet handsome Ben , and she make up a wild story about her and her dad . The whole island get involved and the movie turn into a hilarious wild entertaining movie . I would give My Father The Hero 8/10",1
"It is surprising that a production like this get made these day , especially for television . Considering the strong sexual theme and explicit lovemaking scene , not to mention lesbianism , this ha been given superb treatment and direction . The set and costume are flawless , the direction is stylish and the character are likeable . There is a fair amount of humor but it ha surprisingly dark interlude . The protagonist is really a tragic figure , but not devoid of happiness . Also , this production avoids the mistake most films/shows make when dealing with homosexuality/lesbianism . The character are very human . It seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gay and lesbian on TV and movie most show fill it full of cliche and make the character obsessed with being gay . Not so with this . In Tipping the Velvet , the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian mean ! The BBC have made some wonderful production in the past , and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all front .",1
"I just do n't get some of the big premise of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable , and that there 's anything so ugly it would make you insane . Someone here made the remark that maybe it 's the frequency of the light wave or something rather than it being ugliness . Miranda is just a jerk . The episode is slow , inconsistent and way too talky . I also do n't quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why doe n't the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be ? There 's one part I do like , when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience . Overall , I love TOS and even at it lamest , I 'll always tune in . This episode though - mmm , I would n't purchase it except for a used copy under $ 3 .",0
"This is one of my all time favorite movie and I would recommend it to anyone . On my list of favorite movie ( mental list , mind ) the only one on par with it are movie such a The Lord of the Rings series , Spirited Away and Fly Away Home . I can really relate to the main character Jess . At the start of the movie she 's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who ha a lot more friend who are boy than that are girl . She really suck you into her life . I also certainly ca n't fault any of the protagonist 's acting , or anyone else 's in the film . The soccer wa interesting to watch even for someone like me who ha no idea of the rule . The movie is never boring . The romance is really cute and did n't make me blush tooooo hard ! One thing that really made it though wa the Indian factor . Jess ' parent are Indian and there are many colourful Indian convention throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight a well a everything else . The Indian people are also hilarious ! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it . Feel good comedy are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film . They 're funny , they 're refreshing and they make you feel good ! ^_~",1
"I know that you 've already entered this in film festival ( or at least I think you have , I may just be making that up ) but I think this should get `` best animated short film '' in every one . Bravo . I ca n't wait for the full film . I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animation , but hear it now and accept it a the truth . Kudos , my friend . Okay , now I 'm just trying to get ten line of text ... Though I still mean it . And here come yet another -SHOE ! - and I can not stop here yet . This is extremely annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do . In fact , I 'll probably watch all of your movie in yet another spasmodic `` Jason Steele Marathon .

"This is probably the first entry in the `` Lance O'Leary/Nurse Keat '' detective series ; in subsequent O'Leary film , he wa played by much younger actor than Guy Kibbee . A group of relative ( all played by well-known character actor ) gather in an old house ( on a rainy nite , of course ! ) to speak to a wealthy relative , who go into a coma . While they wait for him to recover , all sort of mysterious goings-on happen , including a couple of murder . A creepy film ; worth seeing !",0
"This animation ha a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action . What set it apart from other animation is how well the human movement are animated . It wa really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around , her movement were done so well . Why do n't they use this rotoscopic technique more these day ? It 's quite effective . Fire and Ice , in it 's prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed woman , wa clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy way , her voluptuous body serving a pure eyecandy . Some may hate this and regard it a yet another moronic male sexual fantasy , others ( including plenty of woman ) will adore it 's esthetic quality . I for sure did not mind ! Bakshi just love animating lushious , voluptuous babe , a can also be seen in Cool World , and I do n't think he ha to apoligize since it 's pretty much animation for adult . But I had also enjoyed this animation a a child and I never forgot it . This one wa just special , so different from the standard Disney or Anime fare , and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it 's possibly Bakshi 's finest . For those who like animation with lushious woman : try Space Adventure Cobra a well . I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10 .",1
"My rating : Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 This show suck very much officially . For me , CSI Miami is the best , CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th . I do n't know , in the other CSIs you get into the episode you 're watching . But in this one , you just ca n't get into the episode , no matter how much you try , so in my opinion , this show is not worth watching . I know people have different opinion , and I respect that , but for me , this CSI ai n't good enough . So if you like suspense , real acting/performance , good plot , direction , character development/attachment and you an overall good show , I suggest you to watch CSI Miami .",0
"I am not a Faulkner fan ( which is considered sacrilegious , especially since I grew up near the author 's hometown ) ; however , I think this is an excellent movie . On par with the quality of the movie `` To Kill a Mocking Bird '' . If you have n't seen it , buy it anyway . It 's well worth having in your permanent collection . TCM recently played the movie a a part of the Race on Film series . I wish they 'd play it more often . Very moving . On a side note , the folk from Oxford , Mississippi , will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square a it wa back in the 1940 's . The Courthouse , City Hall , etc . : They 're all on screen . I never knew the movie wa filmed there until I noticed the familiarity of the building . When I saw the arch in the front of City Hall , I began to get suspicious . Look closely at the pennant on Chick 's wall : You 'll see two for Ole Miss !",1
"Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy film . The film delivers the spell-casting special effect that one can expect , but fails painfully on all other front . The actor all play extremely silly caricature . You have to be still in diaper to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny . The plot is predictable , and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow . Towards the end , the movie begin to resemble old Godzilla film , including shabby larger-than-life special effect and a ( well , yet another ) ghost with a Godzilla head . Maybe I would have grinned if I wa expecting camp . It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fan have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula . They wo n't be able to do it again : the cash cow is now dead a a dodo .",0
"I ca n't stand most reality show and this one is worst than the one with Paris Hilton , and sure it 's his company . But `` you 're fired '' or `` you 're hired '' , for how many season now ? After watching the show I would n't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry ha more entertainment valve . I 'd love to hear just one person get up and say `` Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo '' . I see he 's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE . I hope he get hurt so I do n't have to see his pathetic face anymore . It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an as of yourself trying to buy it . I 'd give this show a negative mark if I could but it get a 1 and it doe n't deserve that .",0
"If I had known this movie wa filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing Dogme 95 style , I would never have rented it . Nevertheless , I took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot . I lasted a very , very , very long forty minute before giving up . It 's just boring , pretentious twaddle . The last French movie I saw wa `` Romance '' and it too wa pretty dismal , but at least the camera wa steady and not breathing down the neck of the character all the time . I am baffled at the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas -- it 'll catch on in America about the same time a the next big outbreak of leprosy .

He really put on a top notch performance , and the girl who played his sister wa really awesome and gorgeous . Seriously , I thought she wa Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile . I ca n't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar . He 's one of my favorite actor . I love Anne Rice . I 'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles , but I 'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book . This is a little too '' real '' for me . I prefer Lestat and Louis 's witty little tiff to the struggle of slave . Eartha Kitt wa so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie wa ruined for me ; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show . ( sorry for the ambiguity , but I do n't want to give anything away ) Sorry , but it 's just not my type of show .",0
"First , let me just comment on what I liked about the movie . The special effect were fantastic , and very rarely did I feel like I wa watching a video game . There , that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film . In fact , I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I ca n't even put into word how hard it wa for me to write this review without swearing . I have innumerable complaint about the film , but four major complaint jump to mind . My first major complaint ha to do with the incredible cheesiness of the `` plot twist '' ( if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away ) where Lois 's 5 year-old son turn out to be the super-powered child of Superman . When the cry super-child throw a piano at Lex 's henchman to save his mother , I almost got up and left the theater . Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmick like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child . It 's been 5 day since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit . My next major complaint ha to do with the fact that Superman lift a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space . It doe n't take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what 's wrong with that . I do n't know how many comic book Brian Singer ha read , but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely ha the strength to stay on his foot . Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space ha no business being associated with any Superman-related project ever again . The concept is a ridiculous a making a Dracula movie where the title character ha a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun . Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite ? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it , and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajama . That 's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hit the ground . My third major complaint ha to do with the fact that Singer slap movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie . I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman a the only son of a God-like Jor-el sent to Earth to be a savior . Jor-el wa n't all-wise , he wa just a scientist . And he did n't send his son to earth to be a savior , he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet wa about to explode . I 'll buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven wa about to explode , and then radioactive piece of Heaven become Christ 's primary weakness . Furthermore , the `` crucifixion '' scene where Luthor stab Superman in the side with a kryptonite `` spear '' just make me want to slam my face into a brick until I 'm too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future . They might a well rename this movie `` Superman Returns : the Passion of the Christ . '' And speaking of Luthor , my last major complaint ha to do with Singer 's depiction of Lex Luthor . Lex Luthor is a shrewd , cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President ( which he doe in the comic ) than try to destroy the world . The man want money and power ; he want to be in charge , not wreck everything . Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns , a well a all the previous Superman movie , is a wacky theatrical dunce who come up with zany scheme to destroy the world . If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the character instead of the ( quite awful ) previous Superman movie , this film might not be such an unbearable travesty . Maybe Singer 's next project can be a Batman movie where he focus on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show . ZAM ! WHAP ! POW ! ! To summarize , I do n't know what I hate more , the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good review . Everyone is entitled to their opinion , but if you do n't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong . I sincerely encourage anyone who read this not to see this movie if you have n't already . Do n't see it , do n't buy it when it come out on DVD , do n't rent it ... basically do n't contribute any money towards it in any way . This movie doe not deserve to make any money . In fact , I think that for every person that see this movie , Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollar . If you 're a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie , just bend over and have someone kick you in the ball and you 'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hour of your time .",0
"This is one of the best TV production of a musical ever . I have heard the Merman cast album , the Angela Lansbury album , I have seen Tyne Daly live , and I 've seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless time . I think Bette is if not the best , then tied with the best . She capture not just the bravura , but also the pathos of Mama Rose . I wa never a Natalie Wood fan , so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb , in what is arguably her best role . Everything from the costume to the set to the supporting performance is wonderful . The three stripper , led by the always-dependable Christine Ebersole are hard to top . There wa supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few year back , with Cher , but I think Bette would be the best bet ( pun intended ) for Auntie Mame .",1
"I am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad . It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference : no porn . The story and dialogue need a complete overhaul . Maybe then the bad acting would not have been a noticeable . At the very least , the pacing should have been picked up . While I accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resource he had , he should have spent more time on the story or better yet , get someone else to write it . Many of the action scene were just pointless . It wa a complete waste of my time .",0
"Is it a perfect movie ? No . It is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it feature vampire from space , naked beauty and the British army efficiency . When I first saw this movie I wa rather young and all I can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and Mathilda May . Actually , if it were n't for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie , I probably would n't have rated it so high , but given her sheer magnificence , I am now actually considering voting it up ! Lucky for me I got reminded of the movie and watched it again now . Imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist special effect splattered unto a rather decent sci-fi story , but with completely over the top performance . I still enjoyed the movie tremendously ( a well a Mathilda May ) , but it wa a mixture of nostalgia , comparing with the crap movie they make today and actually wanting more when it ended . Bottom line : if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie . Oh , and did I mention Mathilda May is young , beautiful and naked ?",1
"Overall I wa rather impressed with the pilot . The initial first fifteen minute were worrying , a it did feel the creator were trying to create a science fiction version of The O.C but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show step into theme and situation that I very rarely see television tackle . BSG dealt with theme such a monotheism , existentialism , reality , death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext , there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose . Here on the other hand these subject are the focus of the show and I personally found myself evoking such work a Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix a reference point while watching and being surprised by how well the theme were being discussed . I think if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other films/television show , which deal with the subject I referenced , I think you will find at least something here . In term of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about I believe they handled it in a very interesting way , I especially liked how they explained where the Cylon 's belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to u a viewer . The only real weak point I noticed were the relationship between the Greystone parent and the actress who play 'Lacy Rand ' . While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually , together their scene seemed to lack chemistry , at this point it could simply be down to developing their character , but this is something I think need work . I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role . This again could be down to experience and time needed to develop , but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident . Based on the pilot I greatly look forward to seeing where 'Caprica ' go in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that BSG once did .",1
"I 'm the type of guy who love hood movie from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season , from the b grade to the Hollywood . but this movie wa something different . i am no hater and this movie wa kinda enjoyable . but some bit were just weird . well the acting wa n't to good , compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz ( quite good ) and Ice-T in new Jack and SVU ( great ) . the scene where Corrupt ( Ice-T ) kill the wan na be Jamaican dude he say something and light himself on fire burning both Ice-T and the other dude , this kill the Jamaican , however Ice-T is unharmed , very similar to Ice 's other movie Urban Menace ( which star both of these actor ) were Snoops character is supernatural , however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon . When MJ ( Silkk ) get stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fight normally and wa stabbed in the thigh-WITH OUT BLOOD . and when MJ confesses killing a cop co the cop wa beating up his friend Benny wa weird , Benny is n't introduced in this movie and the scene is n't in the film . it doe hold weight to the fact why Corrupt want to kill MJ but is still make u scratch your head . wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doe n't mention what happen 2 other main character MJ and Lisa . the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plague the life of Latinos and Blacks word wide-was a good part of the film , even though the clip of the project wa re-used thousand of time . and the scene where Miles kill the Latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed ( not wearing a helmet ) and running into my Latino brother car would of killed him . the movie wa similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actor were in both of these movie a well a the production team . it wa OK tho . but me being from poverty i love hood film , however if u do n't love em like i do Do n't WATCH IT . only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which wa made with 100 dollar , and my love of the genre .

"I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game , HUGE fan . It still hold a place in my top-10 game list of all time ! The story line wa new , fresh ... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on ... or so i thought ... Farcry the Movie is no le than another director attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise ( see Doom : The Movie , and many more ... ) . The Video Game begin a the player ( Jack Carver ) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier . Jack then find a communication device where ( Harlan Doyle ) guide him across island , shipwreck , jungle , installation and VOLCANOES , to find his ( lady friend ? ) ( Valerie Constantine ) , all the wile battling mutated super soldier , and genetically enhanced animal . The Movie play out very , very differently : 1 : There 's a needle 30 min ( 1/3 of the movie ) of `` backstory '' before we even get to the 'boat blowing up ' scene . 2 : Jack then walk onto the beach , kill some goon , then drive off ... Nothing like the game ... 3 : There is no communicator with Doyle on the other end ... 4 : The 'Modified Soldiers ' look like albino with singlet on ... And there wa no mutated 'monkey-like ' creature jumping out of the bush . A part of the Farcry game i enjoyed allot ... 5 : There is no sun filled beach scene , no aircraft carrier , no communication station on huge cliff , LITTLE reference to any in-game content ( characters/items/vehicles ) , in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all . 6 : The climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building . 7 : There 's an Ending scene ... where everyone ( except Krieger ) live happily ever after ... WHAT THE ! I recommend avoiding this movie at all cost ! If you are a Gamer , you will HATE this movie will all your soul . It is a movie clearly intended for male , so girl , stay away ... So if your a male , 12-29 year of age , have never played Farcry , and are not disgusted by director attempt at porting books/games to the cinema ... then this is for you ...",0
"one of the best ensemble acted film I 've ever seen . There is n't much to the plot , but the acting- incredible . You see the character change ever so subtly , undr the influence of the rented villa in Italy , and love . And happiness . The film cast a mesmerizing spell on you , much a the villa doe on all the woman . Truly `` enchanted '' .",1
"I have n't seen this movie in about 5 year , but it still haunt me . When asked about my favorite film , this is the one that I seem to always mention first . There are certain film ( work of art like this film , `` Dark City '' , and `` Breaking the Waves '' ) that seem to touch a place within you , a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive , that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer , not unlike a life-changing event , such a the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This film `` shook '' me when I first saw it . It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several day .",1
"Today , I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood . Hollywood ha produced movie based on one of the darkest day of our nation . 911 changed everything . It changed our perception of security . It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity . Most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world . However , I ca n't not stress how utterly repulsed , disillusioned , and angry I am at the careless , blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction . This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoer and critic alike ; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press . Hollywood ha sunk to a new low . Even lower than the low-down bastard who perpetrated the most barbaric act of savagery and unrelenting cruelty . Behind it all is Uwe Boll . I am very angry at this movie . How dare they disrespect the memory of family of those lost ? How dare they mock the life of the brave men and woman who risked their life to save those trapped in the doomed tower on that fateful day of infamy ? ! ? ! ? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world ? ! ? ! ? ! How ... dare ... they ? To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty , I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength : Remember . Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person . Think back to that day , ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the life lost on that day . Think back to that day of the outcry of family of loved one . Think back to that day of the life lost on those two plane . Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attack . Ask yourself if you have a soul . Think . Remember . Respect the memory of the life lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all .",0
"You can not deny that we have an affinity for speed . That 's why movie like Fast and the Furious , Dhoom , Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audience , especially local one . We live on a tiny island , and I can not fathom why , for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system , most of u want to get into debt by owning a set of wheel which come with 100 % tax when they reach our shore , and the myriad of tax and bill to pay when operating one . Not only that , the high end sport car were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear , lest they reach the sea . And these movie are relatively easy to make . Hot wheel and hot chick always go down well together in targeting the required demographic . For once , those plunging neckline exposing uncanny buxom and short skirt accentuating leg two meter long , ca n't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curve that exotic car posse in movie such a these . Of course there are amongst u ( ahem ) those that go for the sexist portrayal of woman a mere sexual object ( otherwise explain why motor show come with truckloads of model , and movie such a these can not do without a leggy model in a frame ) , however , they do n't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sigh whenever the four wheeler come on screen , even when they do exactly nothing and have their gear into Park . The guy sitting beside me , I swear he wet his pant every time his dream car ( s ) appear , and creamed his pant even more when he hears those growling engine moan . So there we have it , the fan boy who turned up in drove just to watch which of the latest cool car get featured in the movie . With the Fast and the Furious franchise , the Japanese model like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage , a doe the GT . Here , the Ford GT take on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification , that even I 'm impressed , alongside the latest model like the Ferrari Enzos , Porshe Carerra GTs , Koenigsegg CCXs , and every car out there that ha wing for door . But seriously , my heart go out to the car each time they 're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment . I mean , this are perfectly fine , high performance model that are at the apex of motoring , but yet because whoever financed the movie had million to blow , they do so because they can , There 's no story in Redline , just excuse to put together a movie full of beauty ( the car that is ) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible , and with the usual shot of pedal ( always the accelerator , mind you , tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy , and earn you no respect ) , steering wheel , gear shift ( always shifting up and not down ) , all these while having the actor make pretend that they 're the baddest ass with an engine , snarling and giving each other dirty look . Not a very tall order for an actor , and that 's why we get the most woeful performance ever , with line that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids . The heroine ( yes , it made a statement that girl can drive ) Natasha ( a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin ) is one of those million dollar find - a girl with model look who do n't mind getting down on four and immersed in oil , who ha racing pedigree within her , and performs with a rock band singing song with lyric that are just plain laughable ( every line had to do with car , and when singing about love , just had to string those innuendo like shifting gear shaft , lubricant and going for ride ) . Introduced against her wish to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous ( Eddie Griffin ) , she get drawn into family squabble involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran , and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle . Everything else , well like I said , just serf a an excuse for the movie to go from race to race . And it 's almost always the same , a there 's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race car , especially when you know the race is rigged ( for narrative reason ) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line . While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actor , and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker , Sun Kang , and of course , the star it created - Vin Diesel , Redline had none , just pretty face with lot of air unfortunately . It look like a TV movie in it treatment from the get go , with a very insipid opening sequence where it 's one man , one car , and a 105 minute race against time to get to Vegas . If not for the car , then this movie seriously is a piece of junk , with bad acting , bad line and bad action . Strictly for the car fan , or those who like their movie with countless of bevy beauty who pimp their body without any speaking line .",0
"Im the type of person who always go 2 to horror section when I 'm picking a film , so i picked five across the eye , i wa disgusted with this film and thought there wa no story line and no point that you could enjoy it , it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch film that just encourage violence for the hell of it it wa low budget and very rubbish ! i think i could of done better myself . i think that it wa the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actor were rubbish the camera wa awful the picture wa bad and the sound wa not up to scratch , i think it wa a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it ha not worked at all it wa foul .",0
"Seven Ups ha been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene , but doe not come anywhere near matching Bullitt . Bullitt ha a beginning that build build build . When McQueen leaf the seedy hotel , get into his Mustang , which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway ( now torn down ) and notice the Charger sitting nearbye , you know you are about to see something spectacular . From that moment on , when McQueen start that car , begin the best car chase sequence ever filmed . Adding to it is a terrific Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly sound track . This go on for a long time before you actually hear the first tire squealing . That shot of McQueen 's Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman 's rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact . Hickman 's look of surprise and double take really add to the effect . Then of course , San Francisco is unmatched for the setting of car racing up and down hill and around bend . Also , Bullitt being filmed in the 60 when car were still `` Hot '' ( Mustang GT and Dodge Charger ) made for a better set of wheel then two boring , smog device laden Pontiacs in the 1970s Seven Ups . Bill Hickman wa the driver of the bad guy car in both movie . I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I wa doing movie review for a paper . They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene . Seven ups had a few `` jump '' over little hill , ( Yawn ) but of course they were not San Francisco hill . The Seven Ups chase , where they are actually going fast , is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt . But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity . Strictly Hollywood , I would say , except that it wa filmed in New York .",1
"Have you ever heard the saying that people `` telegraph their intention ? '' Well in this movie , the character ' action do more than telegraph future plan -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head . This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better , or if the character were more charismatic or nuanced . Embeth Davidtz 's character is not mysterious , just wooden , and Kenneth Branagh doe n't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably wa written to have . The bottom line : obvious plot , one-note performance , unlikeable character , and grotesque `` Southern '' accent employed by British actor .",0
"`` Night of the Living Homeless '' wa a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11 . Obviously a parody of various zombie movie , most notably Dawn of the Dead , this episode parallel the homeless with the living dead , a creature who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brain . Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he , out of the goodness of his heart , give a $ 20 to a homeless man in front of his house . More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park , until the town is completely overrun with them . This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode , a he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adult who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center . But before Randy make it to the community center , he is accosted by hundred of homeless people while hilariously screaming `` I do n't have any change ! ! '' Unfortunately , the refugee end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless , when he try to escape by catching a bus out of town , and unwittingly toss away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people . Then he becomes one of them , asking everyone for change . The boy attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park , and find a man who is a director of homeless study . They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless , so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem . Unfortunately , homeless people break into the man 's house , and he attempt to take the easy way out by shooting himself . However , he fails several time , a he shoot himself in the jaw , in the eye , in the chest , in the neck , in the shoulder , screaming horribly until he finally dy . This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in `` Fantastic Easter Special '' two week ago . Meanwhile , a member of the refugee discovers that due to the homeless problem , the property value have nosedived , thus the bank ha foreclosed on his house , making him homeless . Randy immediately turn on him , holding the gun to the man 's head . When the man finally begs the others for a few buck to help him out , Randy pull the trigger . In Evergreen , the boy find out that the citizen of the town sent the homeless to South Park , and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country . The boy modify a bus that lead the homeless out of South Park and take them all the way to Santa Monica , California . The zombie movie parallel and the great Randy Marsh line make this one definitely re-watchable . 8/10",1

I gave this a 1 . There are so many plot twist that you can never be sure to root for . Total mayhem . Everyone get killed or nearly so . I am tired of cross hair and changing view .

Not an easy film to like at first with both the lead character quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is Paula Sage 's touching performance which drive the film into uncharted water and transcends the rather awkward storyline . This give the film a feeling of real truth and make you think you 've seen something special . ( 7/10 ),1
"I read the book before seeing the movie , and the film is one of the best adaptation out there . Very true and faithful to the book . Sean Penn and Sarandon are amazing . Robbins is a talented filmaker and I wish he would add more to his repetoire . He made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth . An especially brilliant bit of filmaking wa the reflection of the victim appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end .",1
"DOCTEUR PETIOT , starring Michel Serrault , is a brutal story about a brutal man . A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France , even if their ability to compensate is not there . Yet , he prey on the weakest amidst the populace . The imagery and cinematography are superb , and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story . He is the perfect psychopath . Seductive and altruistic , intelligent and caring , calculating and murderous . A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer . Kudos to Mr. Serrault , for his chilling portrayal .",1
"I just got this video used and I wa watching it last night . The acting started out extremely bad ( hey -- -- -- hey -- -- -- twister ) but got very good soon after ward . The tornado looked extremely fake , and many of the CGI effect were very dodgy , but the scene with the house cracking apart and the content inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done , and just about on par with movie like Twister . The scene of devastation were also extremely well done too . The story wa very well written , and it 's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old `` disaster formula '' movie of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 year . While this movie had a very weird mix of FX and acting quality , this merit an A in my book .",1
"This film is really vile . It play on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and put it into a school context . I 'm not saying that urban crime wa n't a problem for a lot of people or that school weren't/are n't problem area but this vile piece of exploitation take the biscuit . Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it 's not a case of social issue but a white , upper-middle class student us it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol . And of course he know how to play the system . Does that sound familiar . Yes . This turd is pure violent exploitation , a really nasty piece of work . It 's disturbing brutality dressed up a a social comment . This belongs in the same category a trash like Exterminator , Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on . The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox wa so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this .",0
"What a horrible , horrible film . The worst collection of cliche I have seen in a long time . Not that I saw much . I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minute in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerve . Meryl Streep wa awful a usual . How many hurt and tortured expression can 1 person have ? Aidan Quinn 's talent were - a so often - totally wasted . And who told Gloria Estefan she could act ? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotype . ( Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teach underprivilegded kid violin in poor neighbourhood school ) . The kid were n't even cute ! Just written in to suit the appalling script . Aaargh ! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once . real horror this one !",0
"Motocrossed wa fun , but it wa n't that great . I guess I just did n't understand a lot of the Motocross racing `` lingo '' ( and there wa A LOT of that in the film ) ! The plot wa n't what I expected from the Disney Channel preview , so that could account for some of my disappointment .",0
"Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he ha finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood ; now he want to broaden his horizon and ( * * SPOILER * * ) need a family member in order to do it . A failure a a horror movie because it simply ai n't scary at all . Works better a a dark , macabre black comedy , to tell you the truth . Freddy Krueger ha now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer . ( Too many wisecrack , that 's for sure . ) The actor are n't interesting ( save Robert Englund , a always , and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto ) and there are simply far too many visual effect . The finale is OK but doe n't provide a many spark a I think one might hope . In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer 's story , it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scene than ever before . There are cameo worth noting : a joint cameo by then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value , an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper , and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become . Film debut of Breckin Meyer , who play Spencer . One of the best thing about it is the replaying of key scene from earlier entry during the closing credit . 4/10",0
"OK , I 'm Italian but there are n't so many Italian film like this . I think that the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film but the final is too simple , too predictable .

The best thing on it is a great , great actor . You know , if your name were Al Pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance . But it 's only a great theater Italian actor called Toni Servillo . Yes , someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it 's too slow , it 's so boring , so many silence , but i think that this component it fantastic , it the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl , the grand-daughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani , Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni . One of my favorite Italian film .",1
"If you only see one Ernest movie in your life , make it this one ! This is by far the best in the series , with it nonstop laugh and clever humor that is suitable for all age . The other `` Ernest '' flick were good too , but most people tend to get tired of him quickly ( not ME , however. ) . In this movie , Ernest P. Whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case . The murderer , Nash , just happens to look EXACTLY like our bumbling hero Ernest . Mr. Nash find this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identity with him , and so we get to see how Ernest reacts in the slammer . A great flick ! If you have n't already seen it , watch it !",1
"An idiotic dentist find out that his wife ha been unfaithful . So , no new story line here . However , the author managed to create a stupid , disgusting film .

If not , move on to something else ( MY FAIR LADY , anyone ? )",0
"The first Cube movie wa an art movie . It set up a world in which all the major archetype of mankind were represented , and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they could n't understand . It wa , on the non-literal level , a `` man vs. cruel nature '' plot , where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end , triumphing to face a new , indefinable world beyond man 's petty squabble ; a world where there were no more struggle , but peace . I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 , and it 's a movie that wa never meant to have any sequel . The second movie , Hypercube wa a massive disappointment . Some of the idea were kind of cool , but in the context of the original movie , both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning . Still , for being fairly entertaining , I rated it a 5 out of 10 . The third movie , Cube Zero , while ignoring the second , play like a vastly inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first , sans the symbolism . There is no `` homage '' or `` tribute '' here ; there is only ripping off . The same kind of plot , with some element idiotically altered ( like having letter instead of prime number between the cube - an idea which show more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say ) . That we see something from `` behind the scene '' mean nothing , because the watcher are just part of the Big Bad Experiment , the architect of which we hear nothing of . And , in this movie , those who get through to the exit ( like Kazan did at the end of the first movie ) are just killed - where the * bleep * is the sense in that ? ! That 's just flippin ' stupid . I 'm glad I did n't pay to see this . The production value and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad , but the story and the idea are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10 .",0
"I have just watched this movie on DVD late this morning and wa so disappointed that even thought it wa a good joke for the audience . In other word - the creator planed to make comedy not drama . Howsoever , at the end I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio wa earnest about this movie . It 's a pity because : the dialogue is ridiculous , the acting is poor and lifeless , the story is a fishy tale ! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite of his effort his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance ! What to say for Jason Statham - lack of all kind of skill to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction ... For this reason I vote : 3/10",0
"I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully . Me think he ( the lady ) doth protest too much . The whole thing sounded to me a if the author wa trying to convince himself ! He site profane literature ( writing from the same time period but not connected with the bible ) a number of time however I can think of at least three reference off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to event contained in the bible . Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doe n't make it true . Customs change , word definition change over time ( look at English & German where it is very obviously a common root ) nothing stay the same , it 's always growing and changing . The bible ha many different translation but the King James version is the one I 've found to be the best when it come to any kind of research . In the King James version you will notice there are certain word written in italic . These word have been added by the translator and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse change . Writings from around the time of Christ were written without space , without punctuation , without paragraph & without numeric verse . These writing look like one long word & the translator added all of the above . For example how would you read this : GODISNOWHERE do you read it a God is nowhere or do you read it a God is now here ? Same string of letter two entirely different meaning . This is why many biblical researcher use a 'Lexicon ' to assist them in translation a it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic , Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture wa originally written . It 's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doe n't exist ! In the end I just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty . Talk about ego ! Putting soapbox away , God Bless Maegi",0

"This is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it , it ha lot 's of laugh , gun , action , crime , , good one liner , and a decent plot , with an over the top , Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role a an Assasain . Tia Carerra look a hot a she ever did and can act too , Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this a the lead character `` Max '' a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent , played by Carerra , and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV , play the bad guy , , `` Livingston '' . The plot center around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who get the money for the respective agency , throw into the mix the Assassain Sutherland , who pretty much ha all the good one liner , this is the perfect crime caper , there is the usual love story , , but played very differently than you would think by Carerra and Griffith . You also have the Russian mafia , Italian Mafia , and Chineese Mafia here thrown into the mix , , the film is shot in Boston , , where you have some great shot , and local , , great photography and music in this film , this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy , , it ha everything that one could ever want . Check out Sutherland 's toilet in a particular scene , , very unusual . this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me .",1
"If you like to see animal being skinned alive , their head smashed , dog throat being crushed my men stomping on them , then this one is for you ! But if you are somewhat normal , and do n't need to see real footage of animal cruelty , pas this one up . This movie try to shock the viewer , and it sure does.With the animal snuff at the beginning , and the killing of baby in the movie ( fake at least ) it wa enough to make myself turn it off.I 've seen movie like this before that show slaughterhouse footage ( BTK movie ) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.We watch gore and horror because we know it just make-up , and special effect , so we should n't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animal , it not what we rented the movie for.If anything , there should be a large warning label put on these type of garbage movie so people won ; t be surprised by it . As a very hardcore horror fan , this one turned my stomach . The entire movie cast and crew need their head checked .",0
"Another Spanish movie about the 1936 Civil War .

Imanol Uribe make his best film since `` Días Contados '' ( 1994 ) with such a sober pulse , a beautiful photography , and a nice script . He try not to take part in the conflict , he just show u some fact and let u decide ( ok , the fact are explicit enough to make u decide in which band are we in ) and he take a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple : Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta .

"A response to previous comment made by resident of the region where this motion picture wa lensed : One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhood . This is simply not true . Prior to the construction of Interstate 64 , which bypass the Ocean View area , the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View . Once the interstate wa completed , Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with business closing up and an increase in crime . This led to a huge reduction in revenue for the park , which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg . Meanwhile , in the past few year , the City of Norfolk ha done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area ha become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing . It ha also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster wa used in the film `` Rollercoaster '' . This is also untrue . Footage wa shot of two coaster car careening off the ride for that film , but the actual explosion and collapse are exclusive to `` Death of Ocean View Park '' . As to the film itself , the storyline of a `` supernatural '' force in the water adjacent to the park wa certainly silly , but somewhat typical for B-grade movie of the time . With the cast involved , there should be no surprise that the scenery wa gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actor . I do n't believe this film wa intended to be another `` Citizen Kane '' ; I believe Playboy wa experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this wa an area for the company to expand into ( apparently not ! ) . A strange force in the water causing strange event in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table , but proved unmanageable in execution . The roller coaster and the rest of the park wa destined for the wrecking ball anyway ; `` let 's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise ! '' . For the casual movie viewer , this would be a `` see once and forget about it '' film ( except for Diana Canova fan ) ; but for the thousand of people who live in the region and have fond memory of the park , this movie is like a `` walk down memory lane '' for footage of the park a well a old footage of downtown Norfolk , the first `` Harborfest '' , and Old Dominion University . Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome .",0
"I wa expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan 's role of SARKAR , but am disappointed . Being a Ram Gopal Verma 's direction i wa not ready for this kind of a movie . Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character , but the movie show that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his . There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan ha played the lead . The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hand of Kamala Hassan , not his son . Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing thing . The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father .",0
"A trio of buddy , sergeant all in the British Army , carouse & brawl their way across Imperial India . Intensely loyal to each other , they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & it demented , implacable guru . Now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment , the water carrier GUNGA DIN , to save score of the Queen 's soldier from certain massacre . Based more on The Three Musketeers than Kipling 's classic poem , this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in Hollywood 's Golden Year of 1939 . Filled with suspense & humor , while keeping the romantic interlude to the barest minimum , it grip the interest of the viewer and hold it right up to the ( sentimental ) conclusion . It is practically fruitless to discus the performance nuance of the three star , Cary Grant , Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , a they are really all third of a single organism - inseparable and , to all intent & purpose , indistinguishable . However , this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time . ( It 's interesting to note , parenthetically , that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished World War One military career ; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War Two - mostly in clandestine affair & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthood after the conflict ; while Grant reportedly worked undercover for British Intelligence , keeping an eye on Hollywood Nazi sympathizer . ) The real acting laurel here should go to Sam Jaffe , heartbreaking in the title role . He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage , making the last line of Kipling 's poem ring true . He is unforgettable . Montague Love is properly stalwart a the regimental major , whilst Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate a the Thuggee guru . The rest of the cast , Joan Fontaine , Robert Coote , Lumsden Hare , are effective but have little to do . Movie maven will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine 's father . The film pick it villain well . The demonic Thuggee cult , worshiper of the hideous , blood-soaked Kali , Hindu goddess of destruction , wa the bane of Indian life for 6 century , ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victim a year . In 1840 the British military , in cooperation with a number of princely state , succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion . Henceforth it would remain the stuff of novel & nightmare .",1
"This movie pretty much sucked . I 'm in the Army and the soldier depicted in this movie are horrible . If your in the Military and you see this movie you 'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted a a squad . It wa ridiculous . They acted like a bunch of normal people with Army uniform on not knowing what to do . It wa a pretty gory movie I 'd have to say the least . There wa a couple scene where they try to make you jump . I 'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent , gory movie . It will be a better movie also if your not in the Military . I also would have to say I liked the first one better than this one .",0
If you watched Pulp Fiction do n't see this movie . This movie is NOT funny . This is the worst parody movie ever . This is a poor attempt of parody film . The cast is bad . The film is bad .

"I went to see `` Passion of Mind '' because I usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romance , i.e . `` Sliding Doors , '' `` Me , Myself , I , '' etc . But this wa the worst one I 've ever seen ! I had to force myself to sit through it . I did n't even stay through the credit which is unheard of for me . The magical realism wa completely missing because Demi Moore wa grim and the lover she wa two-timing were guy who usually play villain , though each wa kind of sexy and appealing . There wa actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual life , with a distasteful frisson of The Elektra Complex ; maybe the magic should n't be explained for this genre to work .

"I thought that ROTJ wa clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movie . I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted . To me it seemed like ROTJ wa the best because it had the most profound plot , the most suspense , surprise , most emotional , ( especially the ending ) and definitely the most episodic movie . I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly le good than than ROTJ since it wa slower-moving , wa not a episodic , and I just did not feel a much suspense or emotion a I did with the third movie . It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising review that the reason people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reason compared to the sheer excellence of the film a a whole . I have heard many strange reason such a : a ) Because Yoda died b ) Because Bobba Fett died c ) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d ) Because Darth Vader wa revealed I would like to debunk each of these reason because I believe that they miss the point completely . First off , WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died ? ? ? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die . Do n't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearance and it wa not Lucas ' intention to make him a central character in the film that Star Wars fan made him out to be . His name wa not even mentioned anywhere in the movie ... You had to go to the credit to find out Bobba Fett 's name ! ! ! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think ... Secondly , many fan did not like Yoda dying . Sure , it wa a momentous period in the movie . I wa not happy to see him die either but it make the movie more realistic . All the good guy ca n't stay alive in a realistic movie , you know . Otherwise if ALL the good guy lived and ALL the bad guy died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon . Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda 's death .. Well , nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope . ( Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy ) Why wa Obi Wan 's death okay but Yoda 's not ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm .... Another reason I just can not believe wa even stated wa because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible . That is utterly ridiculous ! ! I can not believe this one ! ! First off , the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there . If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactic the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers wa through excellent use of their home field advantage . ( Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage ) They had swinging vine , rope , log set up to trip those walker , and other trap . The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantage of the forest . The only thing they had wa their blaster . To add , it wa not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves , they were heavily assisted by the band of rebel in that conquest . I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars hero , the band of rebel , a well a the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain , that would have been a great upset . Lastly , if this scene wa still unbelievable to you .. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scene of a group consisting of just Han Solo , Chewbacca , and the Princess , being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blaster missed while the hero were in full view ! ! And not only that , the hero , of course , always hit the Stormtroopers with their blaster . The trooper must have VERY , VERY bad aim then ! At least in Empire Strikes Back , the Battle of Endor wa much more believable since you had two army pitted each other not 3 hero against a legion of stormtroopers . Do n't believe me ? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our hero were escaping Lando 's base . Or when our hero were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at ( somehow they missed ) a Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star . The last reason that I care to discus ( others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here . ) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed ! Well , in many way that wa a major part of the plot in the movie . Luke wa trying to find whether or not Darth Vader wa his father , Annakin Skywalker . It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father 's face because it made it complete . By Annakin 's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side ( in his helmet ) and to the good person he wa Annakin Skywalker ( by removing the helmet ) . The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene wa about . In fact , that 's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke 's father ... Is n't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eye before you died and not in a mechanized helmet ? On another note , I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse ( even if it is better ) that preceding movie is another reason that ROTJ doe not get a many accolade a it deserves . I never go into a film with that deception in mind , I always try to go into a film with the attitude that `` Well , it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure .. Let 's see . '' That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not a good a it really wa . I am not sure who criticizes these movie but , I have asked many college student and adult about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me ( except for one person that said that A New Hope wa their favorite ) that it is ROTJ . I believe that the result on these poll are appalling and quite misleading . Bottom line , the Return of the Jedi wa the best of the Trilogy . This movie wa the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout it 135 minute . There wa not a moment of boredom because each scene wa either suspenseful , exciting , surprising , or all of the above . For example , the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ wa better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day ! ! ! Finally , I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fan start looking for nitpicky , insignificant detail ( or see it a `` just another sequel '' ) to trash the movie such a `` This movie stink because Luke is not in it ! '' then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately .",1
"Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movie because , unlike the admirably intentioned Gentleman 's Agreement , which it beat to theatre by a few month , it chooses to send it message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying `` It 's because I 'm Jewish , is n't it ? '' It 's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead body are actual rather than metaphorical . Somewhat shamefully , the brief featurette on the Warners ' DVD doe n't mention that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic one , but it 's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish , there 's little doubt in Sam Levene 's performance that the character is in fact also gay  not a mincing caricature , but there 's definitely a two lost soul aspect to his scene with George Cooper 's confused soldier . There 's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is : even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadow , the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable , but then the film ha it character drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point : the tension come from proving it and saving the fall guy . There 's an element of Ealing Films to the gang of soldier teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix ( you could almost see that aspect a a blueprint for Hue and Cry ) , but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir . Set over one long sweltering night , the film ha a great look filled with deep dark black and shadow born a much out of economy a style ( it cut back on lighting time and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actor ) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script : a laid-back but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum , Robert Young 's Maigret-like detective , Gloria Grahame 's tramp and the perpetually creepy Paul Kelly a her compulsive liar admirer , a guy who try on story the way other people try on tie . But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan 's excellent performance a a guy who could do with a good leaving alone a he doe his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row . A big surprise hit in 1946 , a a reward , Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the HUAC , which itself had a notable tendency to target Jews . So much for crusading",1
"This movie basically is a very well made production and give a good impression of a war situation and it effect on those involved . It 's always interesting to see the story from the 'other ' side for a change . This movie concentrate on a group of German soldier who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad , Russia , where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battle of WW II is being fought . It 's interesting to see the other side of this battle , since we mainly just always see the Germans simply a the 'villains ' . In this movie those 'villains ' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of make you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you 're fighting against . At first it 's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the German 's are the evil villain . But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans a the main character of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them . The way this story is told is n't however the best . It 's hard to keep track of the story at time , a it jump from the one sequence and location to the other . The movie is n't always logic in it storytelling and feature a bit too many sequence that remain too vague . It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the character apart and see who is who . It doe n't always make this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand , there are plenty enough sequence and moment present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one , just not the most coherent one around . In that regard Hollywood movie are always better than European movie . The production value are high and feature some good looking set and location , though the movie wa n't even shot in Russia itself . It help to create a good war time situation atmosphere . The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic . But I do n't know , for some reason formulaic character always work out fine in war movie and strenghtens the drama and realism . It also help that they 're being played by well cast actor . All of the actor are n't the best known actor around ( Thomas Kretschmann wa also at the time still a fairly unknown actor ) but each of them fit their role well and give it character an unique face and personality . All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look , due to it original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and it good production value . 7/10",1
"So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert 's book `` I hated , hated , hated this movie '' and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review `` Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele pick for the poor '' . So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it wa really a bad a he said it wa . I know most society say not to listen to critic and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert 's review of Rob Reiner 's `` North '' where he said he hated that movie ten time had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review . Here we have Richard Dreyfuss a a gangster which I do n't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss a a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well . But above all the other thing that were awful about this `` movie '' I can certainly tell you the script wa not written well at all . While the movie start off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss 's girlfriend while Dreyfuss wa at a criminal hospital the movie start off with some decent dialog after the opening credit . But after that first 4 or 5 minute the other 85 minute just consists of dumb character talking pointless garbage for 30 second then someone get shot . Then there are a whole bunch of joke about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha . Not funny . Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra 's `` My Way '' sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss . Of course because the screenplay wa written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoot Byrne over five time and Byrne just will not die . Are we a the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny ? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny . Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss ( who I admire much a an actor ) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this wa released the same year that `` Independence Day '' wa the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful film in history . Did Goldblum feel that `` Independence Day '' would be a flop and then just take the next role that wa offered to him to make some money if `` Independence Day '' were a bomb ? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making film in history find remotely enjoyable about this ? The opening sequence of `` Mad Dog Time '' say that the movie is set on another planet . I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minute watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theater on the planet where it supposedly take place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minute out of my life that I will never get back . Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid . Every copy of `` Mad Dog Time '' should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire . I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one ha won it 's honor a the worst movie ever .",0
"What a boring film ! To sum it all up , it wa basically just Nana Patekar beating up his daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor , while she tried to flee from the village , with her son . Can someone say BORING ? ? ? The concept wa n't too bad , but it wa poorly executed . The Canadian locale , and some of the village scene were nicely shot . However , overall the cinematography came up short . The story could have been great , but the movie just seemed to drag on . There is only so much stupidity a person can take , let alone three bloody hour of it . The best part of the whole movie wa the song `` Ishq Kamina '' , and that wa only five minute long . Other than that , this movie wa a piece of crap .",0
"{ rant start } I did n't want to believe them at first , but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema ha peaked and may even be going downhill . After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie `` Gwoemul '' ( aka `` The Host '' ) of 2006 -- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre -- successive Korean blockbuster have become more and more generic , even though their budget ( mainly spent on special effect ) have become more and more fantastic . Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill , which their industry ha built up since the 1999 break-out film `` Shiri/Swiri '' , by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movie like mainland China did ? { rant end } The only `` reason '' I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investor into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date , for the final scene . Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 `` Dragonheart '' , the movie might have had a few more redeeming quality other than having lot of digitally animated dragon . Remember `` Dungeons & Dragons '' in 2000 ? Has n't anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effect you use , but how WELL you use it ? I hope there are more ( and better ) Korean legend they can use , because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legend with the way they filmed this one . In short , I agree with all the negative review gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem `` Arirang '' being played at the very end . As a creature feature , I would have given it at least 5 star out of 10 if the special effect or action sequence had been worth it , but I 've seen many video game with better camera work and scripting ( just le dragon ) .",0
"As a native Chinese , I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world ' . I said 'better world ' because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand year ! I guess most western audience may do n't know Qin Shihuang ( mean the first emperor ) , the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China . The Tianxia ( Chinese word wa spoken by the king , mean 'the land and the people ' ) spoken from his mouth is totally lie . From then on , one after another , all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did a what they said . Another fact is , Qin Shihuang 's empire only lasted about twenty year before it wa destroyed by people . Well , I do like the beautiful scene of this movie , but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant .",0
"This had a great cast with big-name star like Tyrone Power , Henry Fonda , Randolph Scott , Nancy Kelly , Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known name with shorter role . It also had Technicolor , one of the few movie made with it in 1939 . Now the bad news ....... regrettably , I ca n't say much positive for the story . It portrayed the James boy in a totally positive light .... and Hollywood ha done that ever since . Why these criminal are always shown to be the `` good guy '' is beyond me . This film glamorizes them and made their enemy - the railroad people - into vicious human being . The latter wa exaggerated so much it wa preposterous . Well , that 's the film world for you : evil is good ; good is bad . Hey Hollywood : here 's a news flash - The James boy were criminal ! Really - look it up !",0
"I remember watching this series avidly , every Saturday evening . It wa the highlight of the week . I loved everything about it , the location , the costume , the actor and the wonderful music by Clannad ( I still have their Legend album ) . I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin , this time the Earl of Huntingdon . I believe there were legend of several Robins in medieval time . Another thing I loved wa the fact that it wa filled with young actor , I 'm sure Robin and his men would have young , after all people did n't live that long in those day . Other Robins always look too old ( Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin 's granddad ) . The only sad thing wa the ending , it 's a shame they could n't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose end and give it a happier ending .",1
"I do n't normally write review , but this `` film '' wa special . I could n't turn it off . I do n't believe I 've ever seen a worse movie , but there I sat , watching . It wa like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway . It wa disgusting , but I could n't turn away . Where do I start ? The movie seems to think it 's a sport thriller , but it 's so utterly ridiculous , it can only be a comedy , but it 's not funny , not even in a dumb/silly way . It 's like watching your cousin try to act out a skit on family get-togethers . It 's painful to watch , but at least it 's only for a minute or two . Second String went on for over an hour . Whoever wa involved with making this movie should not work again . The writing , directing , acting , and everything wa just terrible . The problem is I ca n't describe how bad it wa ; you just had to see it . And I 'm sure this will NEVER be shown again , so unless you saw it , you 're out of luck . I mean it wa almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other `` bad '' film I 've seen over my lifetime . And for every film I see in the future that I ca n't stand , I will think to myself , well , at least it wa n't bad a the Second String .",0
"Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability . ( No . Too many are focused on John Lassiter 's `` amazing '' ability to steal other movie plot , turn them into pretty puppet show and then be lauded a a genius . . . but i digress . ) Miyazaki ha given u film after film that deal with important mature issue ( usually ecologically themed ) , and ha an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that wa animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance . Still , Miyazaki ( almost ) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- child . That said , I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability . Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old ( my nephew Link ) will sit still throughout the move , enthralled , a 7 year old ( my niece Amber ) loving it all her own ( and able to appreciate the `` star power '' of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus , a 12 year old ( my nephew Aaron ) who 's review wa `` of course it wa good ! Everything Miyazaki-san doe is good ! , '' a 32 year old animation fan brought to tear by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation ( er , that would be me ) , and a 58 year old woman ( my mother ) able to connect with the mother character ( and I 'm betting the older chara too ) and loving the `` cuteness '' of the child character . And that is what I respect most about Miyazaki-san . He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker . On the surface , `` Ponyo '' could be seen a a simple story about a little fish-girl who get a taste of the human world and want to join it and the friend she make there , a little boy name Soske ( somewhat like `` The Little Mermaid '' ) , but there is an entire different level at play here . True to form , Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female character Ponyo 's Mother , Soske 's mother , the older lady in a nursing home are all genuine character with mind of their own and extremely strong willed . But the girl who take the cake is Ponyo herself . Once she decides that she like the human world , she simply us her own will to achieve her dream . Her father is trying to keep her innocent , and keep her a magical fish , but young Ponyo know what she want and becomes human out of simply her own determination . Once human , she team up with her friend , Soske , whom she love very much ( although maybe not a much a ham ) . Soske is asked to be the man of the house ( at age five ) when his mother Lisa decides she ha to help the people at the rest home where she work during a typhoon that ha been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human . Frankie Jonas ( yes . He 's related to the Jonas brother . Can we just get past that please ? ) give , perhaps , the best performance in the film a young Soske ( which is good since he ha the most line ) . His character is also strong willed , but also very respectful and friendly- characteristic you 're not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific . In the end , Ponyo 's father , Fujimoto must cope with his daughter 's decision and his estranges wife 's wish to allow her to be human . He hope that Ponyo and Soske will `` remember him fondly . '' And once again , Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical `` bad guy . '' Although Miyazaki ha ( for some reason ) received some criticism for this , it is , honestly , what make his movie magical and yet relatable . No one in real life is completely a `` bad person . '' All human are various shade of gray . And that is exactly what Miyazaki doe with his character . And then there 's the animation itself . In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amount of effect shot in this film , especially the water , Miyazaki ha chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever . Certainly the hand drawn animation wa colored by digital mean , but every film in this wa hand-drawn and I , for one , wa extremely grateful for that . The character animation wa extremely fluid , and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on ( quite unusual for an anime film ) . The background seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all it own on the audience . This is what animation used to look like- and what it SHOULD look like . In the end , I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable . Certainly not Miyazaki 's best ( in my opinion , that honor is still held by Kiki 's Delivery Service ) , but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family .",1

"I find it sad that just because Edward Norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it , people automatically think the movie suck without even watching it or giving it a chance . I really hope Norton did not do this . He is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie . I found it entertaining . It wa n't mind blowing or anything with crazy special effect , but it wa not a bad . It wa fun to watch . But yea , definitely not a bad/horrible movie . 7/10",1
"I watched this movie on TV last night , hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease . I wa disappointed , and I think the movie wa garbage . It did not seem real to me . Some of the acting wa awful , in particular that of the doctor . She wa about the worst I 've seen . The whole thing played like a CNN 'worst case scenario ' . Even the obligatory disaster movie human relation bit did n't seem sincere . I have seen some disaster movie , in particular those weather one , which are actually so bad they are amusing . This one is almost a bad , but it is not even amusing , it is tedious and boring.Do n't bother with this one .",0
"For those out there that like to think of themselves a reasonably intelligent human being , who love film , have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movie with funny , smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you . For those with a poor attention span , high expectation and no brain .. well .. um .. you may get bored and find thing dragging at time . This is a charming , modest and well paced movie with the actor bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their role . I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through .. This film is a little gem .",1
"THE GREAT CARUSO wa the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office record at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most `` movergoers '' were stay-at-home watching their new 7 '' Motorola television . Almost all recent box office figure are false -- - because they fail to adjust inflation . Obviously today 's $ 10 movie will dominate . In 1951 it cost 90c to $ 1.60 at Radio City ; 44c to 75c first run at Loew 's Palace in Washington DC , or 35c to 50c in neighborhood run . What count is the number of people responding to the picture , not unadjusted box office `` medium spin . '' The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO wa that the filmmaker took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso ( really not a great story anyway ) and threw it in the trash . Instead , 90 % of the movie 's focus wa on the music . Thus MGM gave u the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO . The result wa a wonderful movie . Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating . Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE , Edmund Purdom took his place -- - with Lanza 's voice dubbed in , and with the formerly handsome and not-fat Lanza pictured in the advertising . If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO , it 's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or le . Do n't be put off by the low price , a it reflects only the easy availability of copy , not the quality of the movie .",1
"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher ; both have delivered le than memorable performance & film . While the underlying `` general '' storyline is somewhat familiar , this film wa excellent . Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performance playing extremely well off each other . The human frailty and strength of their respective character were incredibly played by both ; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reason why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite wa the film 's most unforgettable emotional moment . The `` specific '' storyline wa an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuer must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility ... to save life at sea . The special effect of the rescue scene were extremely realistic and `` wowing '' ... I have n't seen such angry sea since `` The Perfect Storm '' . Co-star Clancy Brown ( HBO 's `` Carnivale '' - great to see him again ) played the captain of the Coast Guard 's Kodiak , Alaska base in a strong , convincing role a a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his vein . The film wonderfully , and finally , give long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard ; it had the audience applauding at the end .",1
"1 ) I am not weapon expert , but even i can see difference between U.S. army riffle in WWI and WWII . In movie we can see private , armed with `` M1 Garand '' ( invented in year 1932 ! ) , not authentic `` 1903 Springfield '' ( aka `` Silent Death '' ) , who private use until WWII . Difference - M1 can load 1,5 time more ammunition and 3 time more fire rate ! M1 wa semi - automatic , Springfield requires reloading after every shot . Little difference ? ! 2 ) German army uniform ha borrowed from 1940 Year too . Especially - helmet . German helmet until end of WWI have significant pike on top , we can not see even one in movie . And if we make little additional search in archive - how much truthful is this `` True Story '' ? I am surprised , how much `` truthful '' can be film director in a pursuit of cheap propagation .",0

"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend . Her aunt ( Edna May Oliver -- a person too talented for this film ) did n't like Wheeler -- a sentiment I can easily relate to . The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler . They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king . At about the same time , Woolsey wa in the same small mythical kingdom and he wa made king . So when Wheeler arrived , it wa up to the boy to fight it out , but they refused because they are already friend -- which greatly disappointed the people , a killing and replacing king is a national pastime . I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood -- the silent era through the 1940s . I have seen and reviewed hundred , if not thousand of these film and yet despite my love and appreciation for these film I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey -- the only comedy team that might be a bad a the Ritz Brothers ! Despite being very successful in their short career in Hollywood ( cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey ) , I ca n't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic idea but much better . For example , there were many element of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother 's film , DUCK SOUP , yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP wa a silly and highly enjoyable romp . At time , Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho , but his joke never have punchlines that even remotely are funny ! In fact , he just seemed to prattle pointlessly . His only funny quality wa that he looked goofy -- surely not enough reason to put him on film . Additionally , Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese -- a piece of cheese that sang very poorly ! A missed opportunity wa the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello a `` who 's on first '' which wa done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing . In fact , soon after they started their spiel , they just ended the routine -- so prematurely that you are left frustrated . I knew that `` who 's on first '' had been around for many year and used by many team , but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist . Once again , I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo . While I must admit that I liked a few of their film mildly ( such a SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS -- which I actually gave 6 's to on IMDb ) , this one wa a major endurance test to complete -- something that I find happens all too often when I view the film of Wheeler and Woolsey . Where wa all the humor ? !",0
"I wa really hoping that this would be a funny show , given all the hype and the clever preview clip . And talk about hype , I even heard an interview with the show 's creator on the BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world . Unfortunately , this show doe n't even come close to delivering . All of the joke are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist . All of the character are one-dimensional . The acting is - well - mediocre ( I 'm being nice ) . It 's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails . If you 're Muslim I think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white character , and if you 're white you 'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white character are portrayed a either bigoted , ignorant , or both . Not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedy are rooted in that . It 's only a problem when it is n't funny - a in this show . Canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis . So how come the producer of this show could n't find any ?",0
"First of all `` Mexican werewolf in Texas '' is not a werewolf movie . This title is bullcrap . The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kill all the local villager in the little town of Furlough in Texas . I suppose the distributor renamed the original title so that it would make some extra buck or something . And I guess it actually work because that 's the reason why I bought this piece of crap , it sounded so stupid . Anyway the movie is n't any good . Actually it 's bloody awful . But I did n't expect anything else when I bought it . It 's a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster . If you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog , actor and some gore then you should check into this movie . But I must warn you , this movie is really baaaaaaad . This movie ha some of the worst acting I have ever seen . The actor try to hard and t it get completely ridiculous . They almost never say a line in a normal way . They always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say . It 's so stupid it almost look like a freakin parody . It 's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it . The worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo . She 's the worst of them all . I have never seen an actor a bad a her ( And I 've seen Pteradactyl ) . Even when her boyfriend dy she ca n't stop being a bimbo about it . I hate her . Some of the shot in this movie were actually quite good . The one that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project . But most of the movie is shot in the night when the Chupacabra strike and the lighting is way too dark . The gore scene are few and short , but really grizzly and violent . The effect are pretty hilarious really , but that 's the way I like it . The Chupacabra look pretty messed up , and it 's easy to see that it 's a guy in suit . Overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fan of low budget flick and it 's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death . I recommend watching this flick with your friend and some beer .",0
"This movie is so God-awful that it wa literally a chore to watch . I wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room , but kept thinking ( foolishly ) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right . `` You lose , we win , yay ! '' This movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that Jackie Mason wa funny . After that , beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape crack . And if you 're even considering renting this turd ( or worse yet , have ! ) I have one thing to ask of you : did n't you even look at the cover ? I mean , with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is ! `` Oy vey ! '' This movie sucked .",0
"The symbolic use of object , form editing , the position of character in the scene ... these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had . The way the wife move from one corner of the ring to the other a the fight progress , the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a bit obvious by today standard , in the silent era they spoke volume about the story without a word being spoken . Even the title ha a least four meaning that I can see ; the boxing ring , the wedding ring , the bracelet the lover buy , and the love triangle at the heart of the story .",1
"I found this movie to be very good in all area . The acting wa brilliant from all character , especially Ms.Stone and Morissey . Tramell 's Character just get smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute . The plot is interesting even though , this movie is more for the mind playing between the main character and how Catherine continues her writing with new way and twist for her novel . The setting wa also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie wa that mysterious , thriller like masterpiece . Go see this film now , it deserves better than what it got from the audience , which wa misled by some faulty terrible review about the movie ( Before it even started ) ..... You wo n't regret it , if you go see it ...",1
"Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movie this ha all the appearance of a `` jolly '' project for Robert Redford , a he get to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine . The story is a light a powdered snow with Redford 's small-town boy David Chappellet ( what kind of lead name is that ? ) who with his eye on the prize of Olympic glory , get up the nose of , in no particular order , his coach , father and team-mates . Women are a mere side-show in his insular world a evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of , heaven above , a free-thinking , independent woman , played by Camilla Sparv . The ski-ing sequence are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bump and scrape on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing event down to the present day . Plus I 'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics ha the same mass identification with the general public a the summer game so that when Redford eventually win his gold medal in the final reel , I could n't really be that excited for him one way or another . Of the actor , Redford , best profile forward , doe n't need to do much and indeed doe n't , while Gene Hackman doe better with equally meagre material . Ms Sparv doe well a the chief female interest well who treat Redford the way he 's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way . In truth though , there 's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequence do n't fully compensate and you do n't care a fig for any of the leading character . One of those film where the actor probably enjoyed making it more than the viewer did watching it .",0
"I would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing , fun-filled , thought-provoking movie . The absence of sex , vulgarity and violence made for a most pleasant evening . I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene , but that 's probably because I live a short distance from there . Even so , this film could have been produced in any city ; it 's the theme that 's so important here . I 'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven dropped down on u . Try it ... you 'll like it !",1
"This is an art film that wa either made in 1969 or 1972 ( the National Film Preservation Foundation say 1969 and IMDb say 1972 ) . Regardless of the exact date , the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period -- with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70 . The film consists of three simple image that are distorted using different weird camera trick . These distorted image are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort . This wa obviously intended a almost like a form of performance art , and like most performance art , it 's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome . The film , to put it even more bluntly , is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film , their family and friend and perhaps a few people just too hip and `` with it '' to be understood by u mortal .",0
"I read the book and saw the movie . Both excellent . The movie is diamond among coal during this era . Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their character without flaw . This film should have made them star . Shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film . It could have easily been a franchise . Release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film . Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed , no matter how late , watch it . You wo n't be disappointed . Do yourself another favor - read the book ( same title ) . It 'll blow you away . Times have changed dramatically since those day , or at least we like to think they have .",1

"Although promoted a one of the most sincere Turkish film with an amateur cast , Ice-cream , I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity . The plot open with the dream of Ali , a traveling ice-cream salesman in a Western Anatolia town , in which he see himself becoming successful using the same marketing method of big ice-cream company . He dream of playing in his product 's TV commercial with beautiful model in bikini , dancing around him . As his dream turn into a nightmare , he wake up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife , who reject to make sex with him for 6 year with no apparent reason . Is it because he is not successful in his job ? Apparently , because he say he wa selling better in the old day when there wa no pressure from global ice-cream company . But this is what he say ; we actually do n't see him suffer that much : he still sell good , traveling the neighboring village while his apprentice stay at the shop , selling ice-cream to the people in the town . Ali blame big company for using sweetening and coloring agent while he is using real `` sahlep '' ( powdered root of mountain orchid ) . Ali buy a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor , and give ad to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect . His wife is not fond of his way of doing business , they always quarrel , and Ali threatens her that he may do very bad thing in a moment of frenzy . In a very successful day , his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boy of the town . In search of his stolen bike , Ali go to the police , blame the big company for the theft , but , of course , nobody take him seriously . Annoyed by the nagging of his wife , Ali go to a tavern and becomes drunk . One of his friend at his table , a wannabe socialist of the town , give a didactic speech and criticizes globalism , and with no real connection , jump to the subject of global freezing . Ali return home and decides to kill himself with poison . His wife wake up and prevents him . An old neighbor take him to a night walk and advises him about life . According to him , Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world face with global freezing . When he return home , suddenly we see that his wife understood his value , treating him like a hero and praising his manhood . Meanwhile , the thief boy got sick eating too much ice-cream . They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali 's bike . Ali forgives them and there come the happy end . Although the plot may look promising in a way , it 's the story-telling which make this film insincere and cheesy . First , the director doe n't show much of an effort to tell the story visually ; everything is based on dialog . And the dialog never stop to show u that cinema is actually a visual art . Even Ali 's trouble are not convincing because we do n't see it , we just understand it from his word . The director market his film a a righteous fight of Ali against big ice-cream company , but there is nothing in the film about big company . We do n't see their pressure enough . The film actually ridicule Ali for believing that big company are behind the theft . And when his motorbike is found , it solves every problem : Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband . Not a real criticism of globalism . Second , the film is cheesy because of the crude humor . Maybe the people of that part of Turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar joke in their daily life , but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny . I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and `` clever '' but they are not clever joke at all , they are just cheesy . Maybe I 'm wrong , maybe American people may like oriental version of American Pie style humor . But American Pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the Oscars , or to have a political message ! If you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man 's big erection in his short ( and we had to endure this joke twice ! ) or an old villager woman saying `` f * * k you , '' then you may find this film funny .",0
"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their film . Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital , and with nothing else to do , Stan decides to visit him , and take him some boiled egg and nut , instead of candy . Chaos begin with Stan curiously pulling Ollie 's leg cast string , and manages to push The Doctor ( Billy Gilbert ) out the window , clinging on to it , getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling . When the situation calm down , Stan get Ollie 's clothes , a the Doctor want them both to leave , and he also manages to sit on a syringe , accidentally left by the nurse , filled with a sleeping drug , which come into effect while he is driving ( which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen . Filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad ( although repetitive and a little predictable ) classic comedy , it is n't great , but it 's a black and white film worth looking at . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Okay !",0
"OK I have to admit that I quite enjoyed House of the Dead despite it well documented failing . This however wa the worst film I have seen since Demons at the Door . Compared to DATD the effect are vastly superior . However the plot is weak , the acting reminiscent of everyone 's favourite , the porn film , and the decision and action of the `` character '' consistently verge on the moronic . I feel like trying out Uwe Boll 's latest cinematic outing just to get some sense of perspective over HOTD2 . I am not suggesting that he is really the cure , more a case of a different disease , but when your sens have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up . OK there it is . I have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is House of the dead 2 .",0
"I wa -Unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80 's . I wa born on may 14th 1994 . Despite this , my life wa very much in the style of the 80 's . When other kid had playstations , I wa playing Zelda on my NES etc . Now , this movie hold a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 year old at the time of writing this review . I , because of my 80 's style early Childhood , watched many TV show and saw Many movie that other kid did n't see , and this movie wa one of those , and one of the greatest too . It start off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville , Simon Seville , Theodore Seville and David Seville . David , the Chipmunk 's adoptive father , is in a rush to get to the airport a he is going on a business trip around Europe . His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack . While they are talking , Alvin express his will to come with Dave and to see the world ( Even though , technically Dave is only going to Europe , so to Alvin , apparently only America and Europe qualify a `` The World '' ) . David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller , much to the displeasure of the boy . Soon Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller . Later , at a local Café the Chipmunks are playing a game of `` Around the World in 30 day '' against the Chipettes ( Brittany , Jeanette and Eleanore ) . After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile , Alvin get 's in an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world . Two diamond smuggler sitting at a nearby table , Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and , needing a safe way of transporting their diamond over the world , decide to fool the child into delivering them for them . They set up a race around the world , where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness ( Secretely filled with diamond ) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team 's likeness ( secretely filled with the payment for the diamond ) to `` varify that they were there '' . The winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward . They do this because they believe that Jamal ( An Interpol agent who ha been hot on their heel for some time now ) would never suspect them because they are just kid ( However , this seems to be redundant , because on their travel , the kid do not have to go through any security check and are never even questioned about the doll , I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamond there personally . ) And so begin a great adventure . This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it . It feature great animation and top-notch voice acting , not to mention the Kick-ass music ( Pardon my french : P ) . My favorite song is without a shred of doubt `` The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll '' An amazing rock song that can not be topped . It 's also my favorite moment in the film . Other notable song include `` Getting Lucky '' ( Kind of Suggestive for a kid 's film eh ? ) and `` My Mother '' a well a `` Wooly Bully '' and `` Off to see the world '' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credit performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra . The scene with `` My mother '' still brings a tear to my eye . In relation to the song `` Getting Lucky '' I first did n't think anything of it , but when I grew older and learned about life , it became clear that that song wa a little bit suggestive . That song , along with the fact that the animator insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panty . This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince 's men , when Eleanor lean over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely . While this doe nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film , it 's one of those unexplained thing like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voice and treat them just like they would any human child . Anyway , A bit after that scene , the Chipettes discover the diamond in the doll and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home . The Direction of Janice Karman perfect this movie a she and her husband , Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the character better than anyone . They even do the voice of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes . Ross doing the voice for Alvin and Simon ( a well a Dave ) and Janice doing the voice for All the Chipettes and Theodore . Speaking of male character that are voiced by female voice actress , Nancy Cartwright ( The voice of Bart Simpson ) make an appearance in this movie . She play the part of the Arabian Prince , a very small , but important role . The ending is of course , a happy one . The Crooks have been caught , the loose end tied and The film end when the Children , Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset , Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race , which annoys Dave until he finally yell `` ALVIN ! '' and the screen fade to black Classic ending , by the way . I hope you found my review of this movie useful , and if you have n't seen this flick , give it a watch , It 's worth the money . This Nostalgic classic from the 80 's get a solid 10 out of 10 . ''Headin ' for the top , Do n't you know ! we never stop believing now ''",1
"Just when I thought I would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a `` Bomb '' rating , a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night . I feared the worst knowing it reputation , and it wa a God-awful a I 'd anticipated . This is a Mexican-made mess , dubbed into English , and produced by K. Gordon Murray . It 's got terrible set and effect , and feature a rather frightening Santa who doe n't operate at the North Pole , but instead from a cloud in outer space , and who doe n't have little elf helping him make his toy but rather all different group of child from practically every country there is . The opening sequence , where St. Nick chuckle heartily a he observes monitor showing all these kiddy working hard while singing terrible holiday song in a variety of language , seems to go on forever , and with no story . Obviously , THIS Santa Claus doe n't observe the child labor law ! Eventually we get some nasty and slinky red-suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth , just to make little kid naughty and turn Santa 's Christmas Eve round into a nightmare . Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience , and it 's bound to frighten little child and turn them off Santa Claus and the holiday forever . Oddly , the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned often in this Christmas film , which somehow make it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre thing that are going on . This easily make my personal list of the `` Worst Movie I 've Ever Seen '' , but I 'm sure that 's nothing unique .",0
"As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film , a lot is lost . Here director John Madden ( Shakespeare in Love ) take on an extremely ambitious project and almost pull it off . What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete . There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic . The cinematography by John Toll ( Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall , winning Oscars for both ) is splendid . Working with Madden , the choice for location on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual image that come from photographing these majestic location in varying light are lush and beautiful . Madden also us numerous Greek actor a the townspeople , giving the town an authentic feel . The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passage and vocal by the Italian soldier are marvelous . Madden doe an excellent job of bringing u the Italian occupation and the romance , which take up the greater part of the film . There are numerous sweet and funny moment throughout this segment . However , by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold , there is n't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated . While the battle scene are well done , subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromise are being made to keep the film from running too long . By the time we reach the post war scene , the treatment is merely skeletal . Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on feature . Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead a the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight . When fight he must , Cage switch gear seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both persona . Penelope Cruz , whom the camera love , give an uninspired performance a Pelagia . In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen , but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic . She allows the character to be objectified a Corelli 's love interest rather than establishing her a a powerful character in her own right . John Hurt give a fantastic performance a the wise old doctor , who know a much about human nature a medicine . However , Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff a Pelagia 's fiancé . I rated this film an 8/10 . Despite some drawback , this is a touching film that is well worth seeing . The photography alone is worth the price of admission .",1
"My father grew grew up watching George Reeves a Superman and when I wa a little kid he had episode on VHS and let me view them including this movie ( passing them down in the family if you will ) , and I loved it . Clark Kent and Lois Lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it 's up to Superman to stop this mayhem . It 's just so wonderful and fun to view . The old style special effect and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology . George Reeves wa my hero when I wa a little kid , and I 'm 16 now , it just go to show how timeless and classic these adventure are .",1
This unpretentious Horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic . Much much better than 90 % of the Scream rip-off out there ! I even hope they come up with a sequel !,1
"I read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but I felt that it truly transported me to Afghanistan , a culture I know very little about . I had great hope for this movie and it did not disappoint . I watched this with someone who did n't read the book and he also enjoyed it . They had to shorten some thing in the movie but it wa a well acted and well shot film . It leaf you thinking about the movie long after it is over . You feel for the character and their plight . I highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience Afghani culture . There are some disturbing scene not suitable for child to watch . It is a heavy drama depicting the horror of life under a restrictive regime .",1
"Years ago , Sara , a young girl witnessed her parent being murdered , now a an adult she suffers from various mental ailment ( did I mention she ha an imaginary friend ? ) This film lull the viewer , not into a sense of tension , mind you , but rather a sense of sleepiness . Deathly boring , I found it hard to sit through a I could feel my eyelid growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed 'mystery ' . Is Sara going crazy ? or is it the paranormal ? A better question would be , Who care ? And the answer to that , no one . No one at all . Skip this film , save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile task . My Grade : D-",0
"In short if you want to watch Burt Reynolds best film than this one must be included . If you do n't like Burt you may still like this . If you love Burt this may become one of your favorite movie of all time ! Being from Atlanta it doe hit home but it 's also nice to see a cop/action/drama that take place somewhere other than NY City , Chicago , Miami , or LA . The film is funny at point with & good plot & good performance from a great supporting cast ( every character is real & the bad guy are not so one sided they are really well thought out ) A nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half & it ha some good old fashion shootout & fistfight ( no CGI thank God REAL ACTION ! ) If Clint Eastwood did his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with `` Every Which Way But Loose '' & `` Any Which Way You Can '' then Burt responded with his best Clint type flick with this , & it come off great !",1
"I have watched Love Jones over thirty time . It is one of the rare film that depict a love story about people who happen to be African-Americans . The dialogue wa realistically written , and delivered with honesty . It wa so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional African-Americans . This is virtually an untapped market . Love Jones wa visually captivating a well . The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memory of past and present love . The feeling of the film is jazz and blue , and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of Kahlua and Butterscotch . If you had n't guessed , I loved it !",1
"The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois . Fellowes ha tried to make a lot more out of this , using the lie of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twist , invariably designed to surprise the character more than the audience . It 's really rather messy though . Fellowes doe n't seem interested presenting the thriller element in a fashion that will keep u seat-edged . Rather his focus is on the moral predicament themselves . The dialogue is inconsistent , stagey here , vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine . Though there is no fussing over the location so that the actor can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score ca n't create a further dimension and often work against the emotional momentum of given set piece . There 's also a very prosaic , dare I say it British feel to the filming . I did n't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation , I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story . Finally it is , in fact , the story which let the rest down . Just a the element of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shape and size , woven a a vehicle for character examination . Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performance and John Warnaby 's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing . I 'm disappointed ; not that it 's bad , but that it could have been much better . 3/10",0
"This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched . At the age of 12 I wa up late and ran across the movie . It wa on the USA channel , Gilbert Godfrey 's Up All Night . I will never forget . At the time my friend and I were really struggling with different issue , some sexual . You know 12 is a very rough and weird age . It seems you are stuck in between being a little girl , and being a young lady . This movie really helped to answer a lot of question for me . I now have a daughter that is 12 . Have been searching for a couple year for this movie . If it ever doe come out on DVD I would be the first to buy . Would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age .",1
"Holes is an awesome movie . I love it a lot and it 's one of my favorite film . It 's one of the few flick produced by Disney that is n't cheesy . Holes is generally a very cool motion picture . I wish Disney would make more picture like it . Holes is indeed a rare breed of Disney flicker show that is cool . Do n't get the wrong idea , I do n't mean to bad mouth Disney but most of it 's stuff is aimed towards kid and THAT 'S OKAY . Children deserve to have their entertainment too . But Disney ha been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail . But not with Holes . It 's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it 's corny . Really , it 's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hood might enjoy since there are character in it that they can relate to . Holes doe a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge . I hope Disney take more risk and make more edgy flick like this .",1
"I can not hate on the show . When the old ( and better ) tech TV had to hit the brick , the channel wa reformatted and new show stepped in . `` Attack of the Show '' is the replacement for the Screen Savers , with 3 co-hosts in the beginning . They were Kevin Rose , Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane . Brendan Moran came to be something of a co-host a well , but he mostly did prerecorded piece for the show . Kevin Rose decided to leave the show , and eventually there wa a contest to see who would be the third host , but that did n't pan out for some reason . Eventually ( I just learned this from this very IMDb messageboard ) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because ( hey , this is what I read ) the two got married . That wa a big secret to me ! Now there is a new female co-host , the not-as-hot ( my opinion ) Olivia Munn . She 's hiding something in those top she wear , while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wa n't afraid to show it . AHEM ! Sorry . `` Attack of the Show '' deal with everything young people want to know about . It 's music , movie , comic book , the internet and television . This is what 's great about the show . If you do n't want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching MTV , you can get all you want on AOTS . Some segment and bit they do are funny . They have regular guest and contributor who are in the industry , a well a guest who range from insignificant internet star to actual big name . Even though the host are n't a geek a I 'd like them to be , I still have found `` Attack of the Show '' to be entertaining , even with it latest lineup .",1
"Worst DCOM I have seen . Ever . Well , maybe not a bad a Smart House . This wa just bad . The acting and story wa fine , but the effect SUCKED ! They were so fake ! The only good fight scene wa between the brother and Shen . That wa probably the only scene in which I wa excited . Overall , I found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly . I will give it a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene . 4/10",0

"Some people may call `` Cooley High '' the same sort of thing a `` American Graffiti '' , but I would n't . For starter , in `` AG '' , everyone wa white , whereas in `` CH '' they 're all black . Moreover , this one ha a Motown soundtrack . Specifically , the movie focus on several working-class African-American student in 1964 Chicago and their antic . The movie deal mainly with home life and relationship . In their apartment , we see that there 's never any dad around . But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest . One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayal of black people is that the teenager in this movie are portrayed a very responsible , worrying about missing school . Two really funny scene are the gorilla scene , and the one white guy in the movie . But overall , the main star is the soundtrack . It is truly one of the best soundtrack in movie history ( we even have it on vinyl here at home ) . A classic in the real sense of the word .",1
"So wonderful , so quirky , so romantic , so Italian . The film is so feather -light you float off into it refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again . A kitchen sink world of bakery , and hairdresser , and plumbing , but one that shimmer with a soft luminescence . Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction ? Take your pick -- they 're both faultless . Let me get back to that New York City that lie just beyond the looking glass .",1
"This film is , quite simply , brilliant . The cinematography is good , the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking . This is the story of Donald Woods , a white South African who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid . Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV some year later , I recognised him from Kline 's portrayal . Denzel Washington also turn in a masterful performance , a ever . I urge you to watch this . It is long , but it is worth your patience because it tell such an incredible story . Remember , folk , this really happened .",1
"I have recently seen this production on DVD . It is the first time I have seen it since it wa originally broadcast in 1983 and it wa just a good a I remembered . At first a wa worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy a the BBC serial were back then . ( I miss those wonderful costume drama that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoon back then ) But that aside it is a near perfect a it could have been . I am a bit of a `` Jane Eyre '' purist a it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book a this one . I have recently re-read the book a well and some of the dialogue is just spot on . Reading the scene near the end where Rochester question Jane about what St John wa like I noticed their word were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly . All the other production that have been done all seem lacking in some way , some even leave out the `` Rivers '' family and their connection to Jane altogether . I also think this is the only production to include the `` Gypsy '' scene done correctly . The casting is perfect , Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book `` small plain and dark '' and I disagree that she looked too old . Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect a Rochester , portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his sock off ! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time , like in the scene when he turn around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted , his expression is fantastically frightening . But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane run down the stair and into his arm the morning after they declare their love for one another . A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable . Oh to be loved by a man like that ! There were a couple of scene that were strangely missing however , like when Jane climb in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester take Jane shopping for her wedding thing ( I thought that one wa in it but maybe my memory is playing trick ) . Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection !",1
"In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedy , King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air , it 's a complete oxygen tank ! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy show of all time . Nothing ha been this good since Married with Children . Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic genius ! And believe me , it take a lot to make me label someone a comic genius . These guy truly understand what is funny . I could watch ten episode of Seinfeld and would n't get half the laugh from seeing KOQ just once . Other funny people in this show are Carrie , Janet Heffernan , Spence and Doug Pruzan ( Carrie 's bos ) . I 'm so happy they managed to get so many season from this gem . The show ha been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic loser . Check it out if you have n't ! !",1
"PREY Aspect ratio : 1.37:1 Sound format : Mono A lesbian couple ( Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan ) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man ( Barry Stokes ) who turn out to be a flesh-eating alien , the vanguard of a massive invasion ... Despite it shoestring budget and leaden pacing , Norman J. Warren 's follow-up to SATAN 'S SLAVE ( 1976 ) amount to a great deal more than the sum of it meager part , thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff ( apparently , his only writing credit ) : Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the English countryside ( rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek V. Browne 's eye-catching cinematography ) , though Annan 's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room mark one ( or both ) of these doe-eyed lovely a psychologically disturbed , which may explain the absence of their respective family , some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and 'left ' under mysterious circumstance . Stokes ' unexpected arrival throw the relationship into disarray , partly because Faulkner ha a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him , creating tension which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence . There 's an extraordinary , multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner attempt to 'emasculate ' their clueless visitor by dressing him in woman 's clothing , though Stokes ' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery . In the early scene , at least , the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity , but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episode of sex and pulchritude , culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan allows herself to be ravished by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner . The closing sequence are ( quite literally ) gut-wrenching , especially Annan 's final scene , which appears to have been clipped for censorship reason in 1977 and never fully restored ( what remains is still pretty vivid , so brace yourselves ! ) . Excellent performance by the three lead , bolstered by Warren 's unobtrusive direction , which take full advantage of the stunning woodland location , thereby compensating for the film 's budgetary shortcoming . Originally released in the US a ALIEN PREY .",0
"The tourist season ha just ended on a remote island off the coast of Scotland , winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitant , both human and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter time ahead . Michael Gaffikin ( James Warwick ) a former paratrooper in the British Army , is the local dentist , he 's not an islander by birth and a such his relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson ( Celia Imrie ) is always being viewed with a little suspicion , not maliciously , but just out of the protective instinct the tight knit community have for their kin . The island serenity is broken when Gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf find the headless remains of a brutally slain woman . He immediately report his gruesome find to Insp Inskip ( Maurice Roëves ) at the island police station , Inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local GP , Dr Goudry , for closer inspection . A quick search for the killer prof fruitless , a doe a search for a missing local woman . Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin , Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson , a woman from the mainland , who life on the island through the winter month . A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body , her home proving to be the murder scene , but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the wood ? Suspicion immediately fall on the one stranger left on the island , one Colonel Howard ( Jonathan Newth ) who also happened be the last person to see her alive a they came across on the last ferry together . Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victim body , it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength , one set of teeth mark on the body seem to point at a human killer , another point to that of an unknown animal of some kind . A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain . With a heavy fog rolling in , the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help , the radio also doe n't work , seemingly being blocked and the phone line have been cut . Reports of UFO 's and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rock on the beach . Inskip is confused and refuse to listen to anything but the fact and laugh off Gaffikin 's idea that alien might be involved , but a rise in radioactive level on the island , ha him doubting himself . The Nightmare Man is based on the novel , Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire , it is here adapted by Dr Who and Blake 's 7 scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience on both Sci/Fi classic and the film benefit from having such experienced genre expert on board . The Nightmare Man though is on the whole , a succinctly better crafted piece , that build it plot alongside solid character development , even down to the minor character , time is given to giving them all a firm background . The island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that ha been used over and over , but it one that I enjoy very much , the remoteness , the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all effort . In many genre effort of this kind it is very easy for proceeding to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama , but credit to Camfield , he hold it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all time . There is an authenticity about proceeding , the character even speaking Gaelic at time to further this point . If there is one negative about the killer it that , we are given his/her/its POV for the killing , an acceptable cliché on it own , but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens , it just scream of overkill and date the film just a little . Still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the specie of the killer , given the clue presented , but it 's a fun and very well acted piece . The local Scottish cast are exceptional , the local bobby Roeves and Cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold . Imrie , never one i 've taken to in other work , is also pretty good and display hew womanly physique a if she were in a Hammer production . The outlandish , maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewer , it disappointed me in some way , but taking into account when it wa made , it an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it , is even more terrifying .",1
"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you have n't seen either movie and want to but do n't want the spoiler , please do n't read this review ! While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time , the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions . The actor that they had portray Ryan Phillippe 's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar 's Kathryn are very poor substitute indeed . Neither can pull off the smarmy , snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actor did . It 's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog wa verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn , but if you listen closely enough you 'll recognize it . There are also inconsistency in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn , then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie ? He supposedly wa supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie ( with Reese Witherspoon 's character ) . Also , the tie-in with the photography/ '' You could be a model '' comment at the end wa totally lame and did n't add anything at all . Overall , this movie wa a waste of time .

"This movie is ridiculous . It 's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible . The whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it 's a comedy . Truly is bad cinematography . You really have to sit there and watch it to realize there 's a few joke here and there going on but either way they 're all inside joke amongst themselves . This is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad . It really is a very pointless movie.Their expression reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turn out that way anyway . Unless you want to be bored out of your as , I suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie .",0
"In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne ha condensed event , eliminated a number of character , and generally implied rather than shown Dorian 's essential wickedness . If you want a more explicit rendering , see the 1945 film . Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame , but were certainly vastly different men and writer . This story really treat of a theme similar to Stevenson 's `` Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde '' , but note that Wilde chose to treat his story a fantasy , whereas RLS took the scientific route . Both the protagonist are men in whom good war with evil , with evil winning in the end . The actor in this BBC movie , take a different route , too , from those in the 1945 film . John Gielgud say all the same caustic and cynical quip a George Sanders , in his role really projecting Wilde himself , but with a subtle difference . You 'll suspect that Sanders really believed what he wa saying , but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely belief . Peter Firth , too , show the two side of his character in restrained fashion , but then we do n't get to see a many of his escapade a Hurd Hatfield had a chance to display . It 's a very good production , with the dramatisation reflecting the essential of the novel , if not all of it ramification .",1
"It start out like a very serious social commentary which quickly make one think of other Clark movie like Kids , Bully , etc . But then just a quickly , it unravels into a direction-less mess . Who is the main character ? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film ? Is this a skate documentary with moment of dialog inserted ? I have no clue . I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd wa going to end . I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came . I cut a good 20 minute out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scene . Yes , it illustrates the changing landscape between the have 's have not 's . I got it way back in the beginning . Kids and Bully wa done in such a way that I actually felt like I wa observing the reality of that group of friend . Wassup felt very staged , poorly constructed and ever worse acting . Teenage Caveman , which Larry did n't write but did direct , wa terrible . But at least it felt like it wa suppose to be a terrible movie that did n't take itself seriously . Wassup Rockers wa just plain bad .",0
"This is my first Deepa Mehta film . I saw the film on TV in it Hindi version with it `` Sita '' character presented a Nita . I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita . Yet what I loved about the film wa it screenplay by Ms Mehta , not her direction . The character , big and small , were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end -- somewhat like the end of Mazursky 's `` An Unmarried Woman . '' They are brave woman surrounded by cardboard men . And one cardboard man ( Ashok ) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him -- -carrying his invalid mother Biji . He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion . Ms Mehta seems to fumble a a director ( however , compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant ) a she can not use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of India . She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter ( not her father ! ) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon day with both her parent in a mustard field . Compare her to Mrinal Sen , Adoor Gopalakrishnan , Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giant -- given her competent Canadian production team and financial resource ! Mehta 's film of two bisexual lady in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some , but merely capture the atrophy of middle-class home that doe not seem to aspire for something better than it immediate survival in a limited social space . Kannada , Malayalam , and Bengali film have touched parallel theme in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers . Ms Das , Ms Azmi , Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding . Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performance under good director ( Mrinal Sen 's `` Khandar '' , Gautam Ghose 's `` Paar '' , Benegal 's `` Ankur '' ) a brilliance notably absent in this film . Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability . All in all , the film 's strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in term of international cinema . I am sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talent in her future screenplay .",1
"All the way though i wa thinking to myself `` Oh god why ! '' At the very beginning i thought `` Right it might be average , '' but the acting and plot on most part wa atrocious . Every part in it wa so predictable , even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring , it wa a half decent movie , but this just seemed to take all the good thing about the first and made them terrible . Some bit made everyone in the audience wet themselves , Eg . The part were Geller fall off the building had me in stitch . My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i wa kept commenting on what wa bound to happen next , and more time than le i wa right . Why doe going into the house make her come after you , it doe n't make sense . It wa a poor excuse for a lot of killing , and no really depth wa seen at all . You can see everything coming , which just left you feeling that there wa no point in watching . Oh shes behind her ... did n't see that one coming * yawn * . Surely these people must have thought to ... oh i do n't know , carry a knife round or at least try and fight back , instead of being eaten but someone hair ? At best during the movie i wa very mildly scared ( and i mean mildly ) , i wa just cry out for the credit , a they rolled i exhaled a short `` Oh thank god . '' If you have n't already , do n't waste your ' time and money on this ; pointless , plot le , sorry excuse for a sequel !",0
"At 2:37 , a high school student commits suicide . Not shown who ha taken their life or reason known , time skip back to the start of the day . From here we follow six separate student ; Marcus , Melody , Luke , Steven , Sarah and Sean . Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemma , all reaching boiling point , hitting to an end for one . After losing a friend to suicide , and surviving his own suicide attempt , writer/director Murali K. Thalluri ha created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide . Suicide ha been a topic that ha been kept in the shadow , 2:37 is Thalluri 's attempt to bring it to light . If you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who ha , 2:37 becomes all the harder to view . With heavy and hard subject matter , Thalluri also tackle everyday teenage life crisis 's . Sex , pregnancy , sexual identity , bullying , friendship , Thalluri manages and show them in an extremely realistic manner . The factor on Thalluri 's talent is his subtlety . He respect his subject and the problem that everyone will have suffered through at sometime . It verge near documentary at time , it ha such a painful realism ; the interview with each character spliced through the film only heightens this . 2:37 ha a distinctive similarity to Gus Van Sants film Elephant . While the core of each film is different , both tackle teen life . Like Sant , Thalluri utilizes long tracking shot , with time skipping back and forth , to show each character interaction from different perspective . A defining point to Elephant wa it ethereal ambiance . With spare conversation , little development of character , and the long tracking shot , Sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread . While there resides this dread in 2:37 , the emotional connection to the character reach a higher level Sant could n't reach . As time go by , each character fragility creep out , dragging you along their emotional roller-coaster . The real hit in this film come with the inevitable suicide , foretold at the very beginning . The hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have a an audience watching someone life end in a gruesome fashion . Though many film that have shown suicide , gloss over the act or romanticizes the act . Thalluri show the pain and agony involved with this act and that it not the best solution . With unknown in the lead and their first major role ; Teresa Palmereach , Frank Sweet , Joel Mackenzie , Marni Spillane , Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show immense talent and promising acting career . Compelling and revetting , 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film .",1
"The quote above just about say it all for `` Slipstream '' . I should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour , but decided I ought to be fair and give it a chance . I wo n't watch it again , so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd line in the movie , I 'm sure it will set a record . Some otherwise fine and talented actor got mixed up with this clunker ; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry . Paxton 's character ha hijacked Hamill 's prisoner , an android taking his name from the poet Byron ( Bob Peck ) . Tasker ( Hamill ) shoot Owens ( Paxton ) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion Belitski ( Kitty Aldridge ) can keep tab on the pair . The real question though is why did n't he just fire the device at Byron thereby cutting out the middleman . If you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense , then I suppose you 'll find something of interest here . But you ca n't convince me that the film make sense on any level . Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make way for high society snobbery , but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when Paxton 's character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickey all over his torso . If anyone think there 's some hidden meaning here , you 're really stretching . Patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming `` The End '' to come into view , ala , even that wa denied . If beauty is in the eye of the beholder , then so is understanding ; this movie had neither . Yet there wa a single redeeming feature a the closing credit began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloon . Apparently the film wa keeping them afloat .",0
"Director Edward Sedgwick , an old hand at visual comedy , successfully lead this Hal Roach road show which tender a fast-moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting , employing a large number of Roach 's reliable performer . Although the film wa originally plotted a a vehicle for Patsy Kelly , sunny Jack Haley star a Joe Jenkins , a young Kansan who sell his auto repair business and journey to Hollywood , where he attempt to wangle a screen role for the girl he love , star-struck Cecilia ( Rosina Lawrence ) . Sedgwick , who prefers using the entire M-G-M studio a his set , doe so here a Cecilia , always ready for an audition , is treated by a would-be paramour , cinema star Rinaldo Lopez ( Mischa Auer ) , to behind-the-scenes action of , naturally , a musical comedy , featuring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti . Laurel and Hardy provide several enjoyable interlude , including their well-known skit involving a tiny harmonica , and we watch fine turn by such a Joyce Compton , Russell Hicks and Walter Long . On balance , one must hand the bay to Mischa Auer , who clearly steal the picture a an emotional movie star , a role which he largely creates , and to the director for his clever closing homage to Busby Berkeley 's filmic spectacle .",1
"The joke are obvious , the gag are corny , and the character are walking characatures - but I could n't stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie . No matter how many time I see it , I still get a kick out of this one , and I recommend it highly for all lover of mindless entertainment . It contains many quotable moment , and some of the best sight-gags I 've seen to this day . If you 've had a bad week and you need a chuckle , rent this one on your way home Friday night to give your weekend a good start .",1
"These slasher pic are past their sell by date , but this one is good fun . The valentine card themselves are witty , and well thought out . The film ha one Peach of a line ... `` He 's no Angel .... '' when he in fact IS Angel ! ! ! Watching Buffy rerun will never be the same ! The cast is a sizzling display of young talent , but the story doe not give them enough real depth . Denise Richards on the DVD extra seemed to think the girl on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their character . Sorry but NO ! The direction is very good , managing to show very little actual gore , and relying on your imagination implied threat . Much can be said also for the similar manner in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes ... : - ( Essentially , the main directorial plus , lie within the `` borrowing '' of various other idea from previous slasher flick . Psycho 's shower scene is tributed , along with Halloween 's `` masking '' . Murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one a far a I know ! ! ! Light viewing , not very scary but a few good jump moment . If it wa a choice between The Hole and this though , choose The Hole . Slasher movie have had their day , and this is just another slasher . A very good slasher , but nothing groundbreaking ! ! !",1
"The only reason I gave this episode of `` Masters of Horror '' a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actor are good , and it wa n't shot on VHS . The story , the dialog , and the plot are ridiculous . Talking / Driving zombie who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war ! Give me a break ! What next , zombie who come back to go skydiving ? Maybe zombie who come back to host QVC show ? I never supported the Iraq war , but I do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and woman of our armed force ; and `` Homecoming '' wa disrespectful in that it mock the TRUE horror of war . With zombie being mass produced in today 's market ... this is the SPAM of zombie-related entertainment . How `` Homecoming '' made it onto `` Masters of Horror '' is beyond me .",0
"Like most , I thought 'another crocodile movie ' . So far we 've had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 month , what can they do that 's new ? Where both those film were about action and violence , this one 's about fear and tension . The performance are n't Oscar-worthy when there 's nothing going on , but in time of distress or terror , these people suffer so much it 's like torture . There are hole in the plot and maybe crocs do n't really behave like this a others have pointed out , but the fear is so effective it 's a stretch to say you 'll enjoy this movie . It 'll leave you feeling a uncomfortable a The Passion of the Christ .",1
"There are a couple of prior comment here which opine about this flick 's abundance of clichés throughout -- and I agree completely , both with regard to the character AND the dialog . I 'd read about Elizabeth Berkly 's awful performance in the equally-awful `` Showgirls , '' which I 've never seen - and her performance here , while not awful , is barely up to the standard of Lifetime 's worse fare . There wa not a hint of depth to her character , but then there probably should n't have been . If so , it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance , since there wa n't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character , performer , or portrayal . The principal 's handling of Liz 's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall wa laughable . Her husband 's initial reaction and advice were likewise ( Forrest Gump , attacking Jenny 's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic , intelligent action , and , hell , he wa mentally-challenged ) . The smarmy , unctuous lawyer ( excuse the redundancy ) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance : he wa both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time , no mean feat . Her attorney wa more of an insensitive nerd , also not unknown in the profession . Finally ( and frankly , I rather enjoyed this part ) , the police were such a collection of insensitive oaf , that you 'd rather depend upon Barney Fife , without Andy , to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community . I know that most real-like cop fall a bit short of the sharpness , intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most character on the `` Law and Order '' series ' , and the like -- but dolt of this level seem to be a staple on `` Lifetime . '' Finally , I found a kind of `` story within a story '' fascination with Josh 's concoction of his being the `` victim '' of his teacher . This scripted performance within the story wa even worse than his overall performance in the main story . This wa something of an achievement , like going from `` F '' to `` F-minus . '' This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minute , following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authority , with husband involved . But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following , and left an hour 's blank film in the camera . But the writer ( s ) here , proved with their ending , they could do even worse . When the situation wa finally `` resolved '' and `` righted , '' this wa accomplished in all of about 45 second , with no indication of what measure might have been forthcoming in any `` real world '' context for the perpetrator and his parent , or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption . This one 's a 2 * presentation ; the second `` * '' because it doe have some mild `` fascination . ''",0
"If you have n't seen this yet , you really should , on DVD . I ca n't believe how much I enjoyed it ! It is amazingly realistic and believable . True , much of it is speculated , and I would have liked to have known more about what wa speculative and what were proven fact ( there are n't many of them ) , but it handle everything quite well with a `` Cruel Mother Nature '' theme . It will remind you of the nature program that you 've seen on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel , only the animal here are Dinosaurs . They act natural ; they eat , kill , mate , play , and fight for survival . You will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others . For the most part , the effect are excellent . At time they will look a little too much like CGI 's , but then you will see them in a different angle that make them look more realistic . In some case , you will actually be convinced that you 've seen a dinosaur . My favorite were the Coelophysis , the raptor , the diplodocus , the iguanadons , the allosaurus and the arctic biped . I wa most disappointed with the T-Rex , however , which looked a little too computer generated at time . In any case , you should definitely see this production . It is educational , well made , and very entertaining . For what it is , it an A !",1
"Why is it that Canada can turn out decent to good movie in every genre , other then action ? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it wa like a train wreck . I just could not change the channel , it 's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower . Its pretty telling that the cast IMDb `` credit '' with this monstrosity apparently never worked again . Bad acting , bad writing , bad narration , bad music , bad hair , bad cinematography . It just go on and on . The movie really ha nothing to recommend it . If you 're looking for bad action film to enjoy by laughing out , there are a tonne of other film that wo n't require you to scorch out your retina afterwards . I hope this film did n't get money from the government for financing , otherwise I 'm never paying tax again .",0
"Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai , India . Sadhu Agashe is a hard working , hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who make a name for himself by killing dangerous criminal in staged police encounter rather than locking them up in prison . His loyal officer obey him without question but a rift form when one of his officer , Imtiaz , becomes frustrated by Sadhu 's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kill and status . A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case . Further change come in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu 's tactic and everyone get caught up in internal politics . I wa surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India . The camera work is excellent , the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds . The acting , pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood , sweat and tear from a close up and personal view and that the event are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director , Shimit Amin , ha taken liberty with factual account . Nevertheless , Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film-making .",1
"Let 's keep it simple : My two kid were glued to this movie . It ha it flaw from an adult perspective , but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it . And the Pepsi girl wa excellent ! And Kimberly Williams wa pretty gosh-darned hot , although she 's not in the film very much , so do n't get too excited there . Not that 's it 's really a bad thing , but it is the kind of movie you watch just once . Do n't buy the DVD . Enjoy ! Did I mention Kimberly Williams ? ( That wa for the dad . )",1

Soon they 're captured by the native and in order to gain freedom they must kill the `` reptile god . '' THE CG suck ; it reminds me of the CG of early console video game . The encounter were lame . The only positive thing I have to say about this wa the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit . Otherwise it 's just a middling effort .",0

My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see . I have watched this movie so many time , that I can almost recite the line a the character are saying them .

Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see in this day and age ... and that is Black people loving each other , looking out for each other , respecting each other , caring about each other , and doing all we can to help each other .

"Saturday June 3 , 6:30pm The Neptune Monday June 5 , 4:30pm The Neptune Few celebration of ethnic and cultural identity succeed a mightily a Carlos Saura 's brilliant interpretation of Isaac Albeniz ' masterpiece Iberia Suite . At the approach of it centennial , Saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing art community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland . The twelve `` impression '' of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings , allowing the power of each performance to explode before Saura 's camera . Creative use of large flat and mirror , moved throughout the set , combined with screen , shadow , fire , rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effect to the varied selection of song , dance and instrumental performance . Photographs of Albeniz reappear throughout the program , connecting the passion of the music to it great creator . Saura encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancer in traditional costume to child joyously dancing with their instructor .",1
"As most people I am tired of the by the number clichéd movie that Hollywood make . There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood . Companies only want to spend money on remake are sequel that have an audience built in . This movie is a welcome change . It could be classified a romantic comedy for it 's genre but do n't let that turn you off this movie . This is a very original movie which is not like most thing Hollywood produce . If you are reading this , you already know the basic plot so I will not bother going over that . The only movie that come to mind to compare this to are `` Interstate 60 '' and `` Art of Travel '' which are little known gem that take a different path than most of the Hollywood garbage . This is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same . Dean",1
"Many of the review and comment I have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by Clara Bow . Although the story-line wa rather typical of Clara 's later silents , I still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun . Clara play a happy-go-lucky Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she love ... never mind that this man is married ! Clara 's lack of modesty wa shocking in the day , but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie . Though definitely not a brilliant story-line ( quite typical , actually ) , this movie is a nice showcase of Clara 's ability to make the audience laugh .",1
"As the number of Video Nasties I 've yet to see dwindles , this little pile of garbage popped up on my `` to rent '' list when I saw it wa available . The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiot . Some other goof get hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use a a bargaining chip , though if he return with the girl and all the money , he get a significant cut . He 's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and , wow , that pilot is one of the worst actor EVER ! Granted , they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood . After stealing away into the jungle , we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the wood like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour . Now , this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever , ping-pong ball for eye and that 's pretty much it . His growl and groan are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack , and I found myself muting much of those scene . Oh , did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity ? This is probably the main reason this film wa banned , though there is one specific scene , about one second long , where the god attack a girl and pull her gut out , but it 's not a redeeming factor for gore fan . Also , Jess Franco go beyond the usual T and A and show lengthy close-ups of female genitals , and , sadly , male a well . So , if you want `` fair '' in term of exploitation , you got it . I ca n't recommend this trash to anyone . It 's not even the good bad movie . It 's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then , if you are making your way through the list , leave this for the very last . If you watch it first , you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list , which is certainly not true .",0
"I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case . Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun , but this movie got progressively stupider a it went on . David Keith is awesome actor especially when he play a role like this too bad the movie wa a piece of crap it really wasted his talent . Judge and Jury wa well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 , I gave it an extra star just because David Keith 's gun wa cool .",0
"I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On wa in it . Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film . He failed thank God . The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who us her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she think Ben Chaplin wo n't like her because she 's ugly . The film is just bad for so many reason . The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bit to the serious mushy bit : ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit . Those two scene made me cringe ! Janeane 's character is sickeningly arrogant ( and guessing from her role a stand-up `` comedienne '' and arch-feminist is in real life too ) . She claim that the film is `` anti-feminist '' when in fact it 's just realistic . Men more often than not go for look over personality . It 's interesting to note her hypocrisy too . She 'd been a feminist and `` comedienne '' for year before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film wa bad . I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it wa released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film . I mean come on ! She acted in it for Heaven 's sake ! What this film wa really wa anti-men if anything . It portrays men a stupid animal whose brain are in their groin with the men doing stupid thing to attract the attention of Uma Thurman 's character Noelle . There are other bad thing about this film too like Ben Chaplin 's character being the British man every American girl find cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few time for good measure . Is that the best the script writer could come up with ? Blimey they 've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made . There 's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and prof how cheap the film is . The other comment on here all say how Janeane Garofalo is n't ugly but is actually beautiful . Erm wa I watching the same film a they were ? She 's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film wa that she wa rightly cast a the ugly one . Although having said that , I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman a well : she 's lanky and gaunt looking . I guarantee three thing about this film if you 've never watched it : You will know what the ending will be ; You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and ; You will be bored after ten minute . Watch at your own peril .",0
This movie ha everything typical horror movie lack . Although some thing are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineer .

"Having just seen Walt Disney 's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog a linked from YouTube , I used those same source to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks . The color , compared to the earlier black and white , are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band player hit a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and take another one 's off or when one dance with the other with part of that other gone-are just a funny a the previous short . It doe get a little repetitious near the end . Still , Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who want to compare this with the earlier Silly Symphony .",1
"The cast of this film contain some of New Zealander 's better actor , many of who I have seen in fabulous role , this film however fill me with a deep shame just to be from the same country a them . The fake American accent are the first clue that thing are about to go spectacularly wrong . As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry , decorated with a few of the multi colour flag stolen from a used car lot . Most of the cast appear to be from the ( great ) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street . It 's a if this movie wa dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party , the result of too many gin , and possibly a bit of salmonella . Imagine `` Under Siege '' meet `` The Love Boat '' , staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea . If you are an actor , I recommend you see this film , a a study on how to destroy your carer .",0
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting role to the foursome of lie and intrigue . Yet at the heart of it all , each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradiction . `` Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life . '' How true these word are . Watson 's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she 's the central conscience that the other three latched on . She is the decency undeterred . The circumstance of lie are to each it own : one to defend one 's professional name ; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure ; one simply do n't want to face the consequence ; one ironically ca n't believe the truth and lie to save friendship . These are all precarious situation . There lie the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackle truth and lie . Contradictions , indeed . In spite of the seeming dishonor , decency and heart remain strong . The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity . It 's not sensational or complex a another film `` Where the Truth Lies '' 2005 . Credits due to Fellowes ' writing and the nuanced performance of both Watson and Wilkinson . There is warmth somehow that come through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lie . Beneath it all , human frailty not excluded , they meant well . And following along with the story , the turn of event provided satisfaction and smile to how the two Manning 's seem to have grown and matured in their relationship . You might say there 's no obvious action drama or thrilling scene in `` Separate Lies , '' yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention . The deserving production effort include cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts ( a veteran to the Merchant-Ivory film ) and music by Stanislas Syrewicz , with mood and tone reminiscent of composer Zbignew Priesner ( of filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski 's Trois Couleurs , especially : Bleu 1993 . ) This is a British film you just might not want to miss .

"I am amazed with some of the review of this film . The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com . This film is awful . The plot is extremely lazy . It is not scary either . People out there who think that because it star Sarah Michelle Geller it is somehow like The Grudge should forget about it . This film is more like Dark Water , except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it . I wa extremely disappointed with this film . It did n't scare me nor interest me either . Let 's face it , this type of plot ha been flogged to death at this stage e.g . the dead trying to contact the living - Dragonfly , What Lies Beneath , Ghost Story , Dark Water , Darkness , The Changeling etc.etc . It seems to me that the only one writing original horror film nowadays are the Japanese and the Koreans . The film that are coming out of Hollywood , like this , are cynical exercise in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer . They 're just being churned out",0

This very exciting movie ha many asset . First , Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful , interesting actor and their presence add immediate captivation . The script is very clever and sure in it knowledge of the capability of computer and their relevance in today 's world . The costume , set , production , and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful . And , despite how it sound , there is a great deal of exciting action a Angela go on the run to defeat her enemy . If you love thriller without unnecessary bloodshed or violence , this is a great choice . It delivers twist and turn with great frequency , making it possible for the viewer to `` net '' a very good evening of entertainment .",1
"I rented the DVD in a video store , a an alternative to reading the report . But it 's pretty much just more terror-tainment . While the film may present some info from the report in the drama , you 're taking the word of the producer - there 's no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film . Not one . The acting , all around , is pretty bad - pretty much all of the stereotype of 'hot shot ' bitchy foul mouthed government agent , each thinking they know more than everyone else . There may be some truth to it , but it really ha a bad Hollywood stereotype smell to it . IMDb 's user community rating & comment tend to be more right than wrong , and I have started to glance at the rating before renting whenever I can . I wish I had on this one .",0
"Look , this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problem that go with low budget movie . But you must see this just to watch Lisa Erickson a Julie . She is SMOKIN ' hot and a great little actress to boot ! These type of horror movie often unearth a rare gem and The Power gave u Lisa Erickson ! Nothing I enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a Coke and putting in this film . My friend Bob , Bill and Dennis agree .. Lisa is not only brilliant , she is a hottie . The movie itself often plod along and the rest of the actor are not very helpful in that regard . But a soon a Lisa hit the screen , thing really start hopping . The others are clearly not in her league . This is not the Exorcist but a I said , if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress , this is the one to see !",1
"It wa n't until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer/star of this movie Tyrone Power died during it making . This no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their mind on other thing , a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described a pathetic . You know when you 've been painting a wall until you 're completely bored ? Well that 's the sort of expression the combatant have on their face when they 're swinging their sword in a highly unconvincing manner The plot centre on Soloman the King of Israel having an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people not being happy about it . You ca n't really blame them since there 's few thing more beautiful in the world than those Israeli moteks , though the Israeli woman here all seem to look like Cherie Blair ! Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of Israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand year ago where everyone speaks in European and American accent After much talking and a dance sequence that ha to be seen to be believed ( And no that 's not praise ) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered Israelis have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army who ca n't read a map otherwise they would have known there wa a canyon in front of them . This is what I do n't get - Even though their blinded by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minute charging towards the Israelis never ever realising they 're charging towards a gaping ravine ! Is n't this somewhat illogical ? It 's also something of a revealing error since the horse , chariot and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figure Anyway the film end with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory . But who need Moshe Dayan , Arik Sharon or God when you 've got an idiotic enemy who ca n't see a ravine in front of him or wave a sword like he paint a wall ?",0
"I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this wa playing at the cinema I could n't help myself . I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing a this is another one of his film shot in G.B . ( which is unique among Allen 's work ) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson . Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop 's most enjoyable aspect . The plot revolves around Johanson 's character ( a journalism student ) who get a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave . She fall in love with a suspected serial killer ( Jackman ) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding . Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen . I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson 's performance but I am a bit bias , I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted . She play a ditsy , yappy , bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen 's stereotypical neurosis stricken character . She add appropriate body language for comic effect . Needless to say almost anyone who see this will find Johanson 's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus . Allen is Allen ... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character . Something that occur in this film make me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however . He is not in the cast of his next picture and ha been spending more time exclusively behind the camera a of late ... Jackman is also enjoyable a the suave , millionaire murder suspect . I can not say that Jackman doe anything in particular to make the role his but he suit his character none the le . In term of the plot I can not help but feel that this is fresh ... In fact it stink of Curse of the Jade Scorpion . Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything . However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film . Instead of everything being black and white , thing are painted in shade of gray . Being entirely innocent ha nothing to do with it nor doe unequivocal guilt . Though the plot seemed old Woody still ha a knack for one liner . I did find his allusion to his last film interesting ... Come for the humor , laugh and be merry . Needless to say if you enjoy Allen 's work watch it . If not watch something else ...",1
"I rented this film because of my interest in American history , and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons . This movie attempt to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his `` vision '' into a major world religion . It first focus on the trouble the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo , Illinois . It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith . Within the course of that trial , Brigham Young stand up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism , and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith . Then Smith is assassinated , and Young must deal with his own doubt about whether he ha been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land . Despite his grave doubt , he perseveres , and finally ha a vision ( that Utah is the place for his colony ) that give him confidence in the rightness of his leadership . Later , a crop are destroyed by cricket , he again doubt that he ha truly been chosen -- however , a miracle occurs , which cement his place in history . I found the performance to be moving , and the story to be convincing and interesting . I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal . Polygamy is a part of the story , but the reason why this is central to LDS are not raised . The issue is not emphasized . I 'm sure people stay away from this movie because of it religious subject-matter , but it ha a great cast and will hold your interest throughout .",1
"1983 's `` Frightmare '' is an odd little film . The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic '30s/'40s style horror movie with the shock factor of the then-exploding '80s slasher genre . It is n't totally successful ( mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraint , and the less-than-professional caliber of it cast of young actor ) but it still ha it moment , mostly due to the classy performance ( classier than the movie deserves ) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne , who play an aging old time horror movie star ( ala Vincent Price ) named `` Conrad Ratzoff . '' At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star a he 's shooting a commercial for denture and we quickly learn that ol ' Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity , prima donna jerk-off . Just when you think he could n't be any more un-likable , the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat push him off a balcony to his death . Nice , huh ? Conrad then visit some fan at a college campus horror movie club , unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually end up back at his mansion waiting to die . Still feisty even at Death 's door , he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kick the bucket himself . Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screen above the casket , which will play personal video message from Conrad himself for visitor who enter to pay their respect . It is at this point that the kid from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad 's grave an after hour visit , breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party . ( Not exactly my idea of fun , but hey , these are character in an '80s horror film . Logic ha no place here . ) The college kid spend the evening having dinner with Conrad 's body seated in a place of honor , posing for photo with it and even dancing around the room with it , before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic , planning to return him to his crypt in the morning . In the meantime , Mrs. Ratzoff , distraught over the theft of her husband 's body , ha called in a psychic friend to try and `` reach '' Conrad through a seance . You can pretty much figure out the rest from here . Since Conrad wa n't a very nice guy in life , it 's not much of a stretch to assume that he wo n't be any friendlier in death . Psychic Lady make contact with Conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion , then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridor of the student ' ridiculously huge house , picking off the young grave robber one by one . This is where the movie fall apart . Endless scene of teen wandering around empty hallway saying `` Hello ? Is anyone there ? '' are intercut with occasional burst of violence ( we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene , which is the highlight of the movie ) before the last two survivor finally figure out ( WAY later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing ... but again , we 're in an '80s horror film ! ) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrad 's body back to it crypt where it belongs . The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effect backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effect rather than music ( thunder , moan and groan , howl , etc . ) that becomes severely annoying after a while . I ca n't really recommend `` Frightmare '' to anyone who did n't grow up watching cheap movie like this on late night cable back in the '80s . `` Modern Horror '' fan will doubtlessly find `` Frightmare '' incredibly slow moving and goofy . If you came of age in that magical decade , however , you may get a blast of nostalgia from `` Frightmare . '' Fans of Jeffrey ( `` Re-Animator '' ) Combs may also want to check it out , a the future Dr. West appears in an early role here a one of the unlucky film student . I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label ( paired with Roy Ward 's `` Vault of Horror '' and sold at dollar store ) because the print quality is terrible . I 'm told the film ha gotten a deluxe release via the fine folk at Troma , which seems appropriate . If you 're a Troma kind of person then `` Frightmare '' will be right up your alley .",0
"People watch movie for a variety of different reason . This movie did n't have the big budget , there 's no special effect , no car chase and there 's no explosion . Actually reality doe n't have much of these either . At least not in my life . This is a very real movie about very real people , none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn make order out of chaos . I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology , since I 'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain . So watch this movie for the character . It is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk . Within the first three minute Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Hayden 's life superbly and he keep developing the character throughout the movie . Excellent acting , very believable . Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his 'Harvey ' and Kiefer 's 'Mickey ' enhances the oppositeness of their character . I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady , 'Mrs Ramsay ' , I 'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friend ! ! ! There 's a host more of these wonderful character but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them .",1
"I think that you can not imagine how these people really work ... ! ! Before I came to the studio to watch the guy work there , I actually thought quite the same a you do . But since I saw and did the work the guy on that TV-show have to do , I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long . That really is no easy work . And also the actor , which in your eye may be terribly bad , are really great people and a lot of them really can act ! I do n't think that the material given to them can really show that , a I think this material is n't very good . But THEY are truly good ! So I do n't think that you , before you have n't seen these guy doing there work , can judge over them ! And I should n't have judged over them a well before I met them , but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it . So please , do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you have n't seen them doing there job .",0
"As usual , I am making a mad dash to see the movie I have n't watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars . I wa really looking forward to seeing this movie a it seemed to be right up my alley . I can not for the life of me understand why this movie ha gotten the buzz it ha . There is no story ! ! A group of guy meander around Iraq . One day they are here diffusing a bomb . Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside , by themselves no le and start taking sniper fire . No wait here they are back in Bagdad . There is no cohesive story at all . The three main character are so overly characterized that they are mere caricature . By that I mean , we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying . We have the hardened military man who is practical and just want to get back safe . And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doe n't follow the rule but ha a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldier DVDs . What do you think is going to happen ? ? ? Well , do you think the cowboy soldier who doe n't follow rule is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade way ? ? Why yes ! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier ha a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy ? Why yes ! There is no story here . The script is juvenile and predictable ! The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look `` artsy '' . And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture , go rent `` Full Metal Jacket '' , `` Deerhunter '' or `` Platoon '' . Do n't waste time or money on this boring movie !",0
"A group of friend break down in the middle of nowhere ( one had a flat tire , the other 's Jeep mysteriously wo n't start ) . One of them take the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone see of him . When the remaining foursome go in search of their friend , they come across nice Mr. Slaussen who offer to help fix the jeep and offer cool drink and refuge from the heat in his equally run down , hermit-like house , which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequin . He go with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaf the 3 girl in the house . Before he go he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack ; he warns them about `` Davy '' , his brother who is lurking about and is n't all there . Of course , one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again . Is it Slaussen ? Is it Davy ? The mannequin ? ? Tourist Trap ha the usual horror requirement ( jiggly big boobed girl , goody two shoe girl , curiosity getting the better of people and never working out ! ) , but it stand apart from the rest of the 70 's genre in it 's twist of an ending . I started to feel sorry for Slaussen ( Chuck Conners is a terrific , creepy , over-the-top performance ) at a point in the film , and you almost see the character of Molly doing the same . This is a gem if you can find it ; I had taped it off of cable when I wa younger , and walking through a used video store I spotted a VHS copy that wa totally overpriced , but well worth it . Fans of Tanya Roberts wo n't be disappointed either . Best part of the film for me wa the scene with the soup ( and cracker ! ! ) I gave it a 7 because some of the movie wa and still is hard to explain .",1
"Most Lorne Michaels film seem to fail because they 're essentially just extended version of skit that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segment . `` Tommy Boy '' is a character right from `` SNL '' - a big fat lovable ( in their opinion ) goof who doe n't know anything . David Spade get the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman role . He 's paired with the Annoying Overweight Slob and they endure Miserable Misfortunes a they travel cross country to Save Daddy 's Business . The plot , for starter , is really faulty . The whole premise - daddy dy and rich stupid son ha to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want . Like any SNL style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty , shallow ; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be `` funny '' together . The movie 's biggest `` influence '' is the 1987 comedy classic `` Planes , Trains & Automobiles . '' That movie is great because the plot is n't stale and recycled . It 's basic , yeah - a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving get stuck with a slob . But it 's real , dammit . It make all the difference . The character are real , the situation are far more real . `` Tommy Boy '' is pure slapstick and it ridiculous situation undermine the character - we feel nothing for them , and we do n't care about what 's happening on-screen . `` PTA '' walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - `` Tommy Boy '' is simply absurd , with joke like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really is n't dead , then awakens and wreck their car . The whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from `` PTA '' and it 's eerie how much stuff in this film actually doe resemble the Steve Martin/John Candy movie . Farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - I 've never enjoyed watching him in any movie and this ha n't changed my mind . Spade 's given very little to do , serving a the movie 's most thankless character . Dan Aykroyd is wasted a the Evil Baddie who plan to destroy Daddy 's Business . The ending is a joke , and not in a `` har-har funny '' way . More like a `` oh god are they serious ? ! '' way . Some people dig it , that 's cool . But I just ca n't get into it , nor do I appreciate all the stuff it `` borrows '' from - not just counting `` PT & A '' - without any credit whatsoever .",0
"Having read during many year about how great this film wa , how it established Ruiz among the french critic ( specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd ) , when I finally watched it about a year ago , I found it pretty disappointing ( but then , I guess my expectation were sky-high ) . Shot in saturated black and white , this deliberately cerebral film ( made for TV , and mercifully , only an hour long ) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator a they ponder through a series of painting ( which are shown in the style of tableau vivants ) and try to find if they hold some clue about a hidden political crime . ( The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered ha a similar argument ) . Borgesian is a word I read a lot in review about this movie , but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film .",0
"Many teenage sex comedy movie come and go without much fanfare , however , every so often a movie might come along thats honest , funny , entertaining AND memorable . The Last American Virgin is a special movie that ha found it place and ha stood the test of time blending all four ingredient . This film follows three friend ( Gary , Rick and David `` The Big Apple '' ) misadventure into the world of first-time sex and true love . Along the way they learn hard lesson and the value of true friendship . We follow hopeless romantic Gary ( The main character ) on his quest to win over the girl of his dream which lead him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it 's ending . If you have n't been lucky enough to see this movie yet , by all mean take a look ... sprinkled with many memorable 80 song throughout the movie to keep thing moving at an even pace .

"I loved this show from it 's first airing , and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week . The plot , character , writing , special affect were outstanding ! Then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining , well written show . I say bring it back , I know all of the actor would come back . I would suggest buying the DVD 's , I am . I hope the sci-fi channel executive get word of these comment , and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewer . I only watch one show on that channel now , ( Ghost Hunters ) , but I am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too .",1
"I did n't know what to except so I think it wa a lot better not having excepted much . Do n't get my wrong it not a bad short film . Tess Nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film . You can tell that it ha been an act of love for her . The acting ( outside of Dominic ) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film it good . There wa time when the story line get convoluted and there are part that drag on , though I do n't feel it greatly detracts for one 's ability to understand the film . If you love Dominic Monaghan a much a I do , I say go for it . The gag reel wa fun , I wo n't spoil it but there is a particular scene that make buying the DVD worth it just so you can watch it over and over . If you like the film then check out The Pink Mirror , a film also done by Jagged Edge . I know fan of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven .",1

"This movie is awesome on so many level ... and none of them are the level that it wa intended to be awesome on . Just remember this : When you 're watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movie ... be they good or bad ... THIS is the formula that they are using . THIS is what make zombie movie so great . And what make it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie . A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know . All in all , it doe n't linger . There 's never a point where you think to yourself `` c'mon , get on with it '' ... it move quick and corner nicely . This is the sporty , little Italian number of zombie flick . So awful , it 's wonderful ! If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek ... rent it , buy it , love it . As a great trivia note : If you 're watching it on DVD , you 'll notice that there is sound effect during the menu screen , underneath the musical score ... Well ... that 's because that music wa lifted straight from the trailer ... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop .",1
"The Ladies Man is laugh out loud funny , with a great diverse cast a well a having some very stupid but excellent scene ( including the funniest love song ever written ) . Ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role . Tim Meadows play an idiot surprisingly well and ha written himself some of the funniest line you 'll find in any comedy out there . It is definitely worth a purchase a watching it every 6 month or so will lead to you still laughing a hard a you did first time round .

"when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess ( 2008 ) , but when i saw the first 30 minute of The Young Victoria i knew this would n't just be a solid movie . Almost everything in this movie is great , the costume are really amazing and the setting are also beautifully shot . The only thing that really let me down are the performance . Emily Blunt ( The Devil Wears Prada ) is the star of the film , bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she show that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance . Rupert Friend is almost bland a Prince Albert but he ha great chemistry with Emily Blunt . Paul Bettany is also solid a Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him . Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting role but are forgettable . To me the film feel like unfinished . Maybe that the screenwriter changed too many thing in the script , i do n't know but that 's how i feel about the movie . But overall it 's a great movie about the early year of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt .",1
"A flying saucer manned ( literally ) by a crew of about 20 male space explorer travel hundred of million of light year from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 year ago on a 'forbidden planet . ' What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth , a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman , and her father , a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demon of the ancient civilization he ha immersed himself in . On the surface , this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery . Some compare it to Shakespeare 's Tempest , but this is a stretch , and , in some way , an insult to the scifi genre . Stripped of what make it a scifi film , sure , it The Tempest , but how many hundred of film can you say something similar about ? Underneath , this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for it appropriate and safe use . Yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from show like Star Trek . Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described a beautiful . The special effect , and even the aesthetic of the backdrop are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable . If it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi prop , you might think you were watching a 1960s piece . This is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi I like to call 1950s sci-fi , and , though not , in my opinion , the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effect . The clever plot , now rendered trite by it reuse in six or seven episode of Star Trek , Lost in Space , and even Farscape , is worth paying attention to , and will sustain the interest of most scifi fan . Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspect of the film which seem to have inspired theme of Star Trek 's original series aired about 12 year later , though they may find themselves disappointed by the ( relatively mild ) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration . While I do not mean to nitpick , the lack of social progress manifest in this film wa the one major problem I had with it . Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young , good-looking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring role . Unfortunately , Nielsen 's performance is only average , and at time down-right poor ( especially at the climax of the film ) . Walter Pigeon , though quite excellent in other film , over-acts his role a well . Ms Francis , Earl Holliman , and the amazing Robby the Robot are the stand-out actor in this crowd , though on the whole the character actor filling in the ensemble do a good job . The problem with the featured performance , I think , are a much the fault of the director and the editor , a anything . Though they certainly got most of the film quite right .",1
"I just saw this film on DVD last night , and decided to check out the review this morning . It seems that `` I , Robot '' ha polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb ( and given rise to a lot of insult and name-calling , too ) . I find this somewhat surprising , a this film is not great ( or even good ) , but neither is it terrible ( or even really bad ) . What this film really is , is ... depressing . Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid , clichéd re-heats , and acclaim them a spectacular new work . This film a `` retread '' written all over it , from the plot line ( an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action ) to Smith 's character ( a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium ) , to the special effect ( that borrowed from Matrix and a few others ) . `` I , Robot '' is , sadly , quite possibly the perfect action movie for today 's audience : superficial plot , insipidly snappy dialog , and lot and lot of adrenaline . Smith is mediocre , but we already knew that ( he seems to be Hollywood 's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis ) . The story ha lot of hole in it , of all size , but I do n't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice . Perhaps a blockbuster by today 's standard , but very B-movie compared to true winner .",0
"This wa a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big star and big effect . Just tell a true story about the struggle of two African American woman over a turbulent century . This movie challenge u all to look at our own personal prejudice and see that people are people , not white , black , etc . Good movie with a good message .",1
"I have bought the complete season of Surface . watched it in 3 day ! I wa so captured by the the plot , theory and basically everything about this show . The actor who play Miles is great . Mile 's sister , mother and father acted like real life family would . You could connect on so many level it 's fascinating . I find animal are so wonderful , you can almost connect with them a a parent is to a child . It would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists . Am sadden , that Surface is not having a second season or at least four more show . I have so many question that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book . Love the show very much . For those who have n't watched Surface , if you like sci-fi you need to watch this ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !",1
"This must have been one of the worst movie I have ever seen . I have to disagree with another commenter , who said the special effect were okay . I found them pretty bad : it just wa n't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story . Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story . The archaeologist are looking for `` the set '' . They do not bother to tell what set , or what is so special about it . That also make it unclear why they search for it in California , while the intro of the movie take place in ancient Egypt . If you 're shooting a movie that take place in the desert , take the effort to actually go to the desert . The beginning - the ancient ceremony - look like it wa shot inside a studio instead of a desert . The action-level wa constant throughout the movie , no ups and down , no climax . It made the movie look short , and that 's certainly a pro for this particular movie .",0
"Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century . He is a true actor . He captivates the audience with his charisma a he doe in all his role . Jessica Lange is excellent a his wife Mary . Mary is such a beautiful woman . It 's her love that make Rob Roy the legend , but it 's his passion that make her love undying . They need each other . Tim Roth a the evil Cunningham is perfect ; in one way or another , upon watching the movie , you will find Cunningham disgusting . The Scotland scenery is beautiful . The environment and condition of the time are depicted quite well . If you like history , romance , passion and love , you 'll enjoy Rob Roy . There is violence and blood , but it 's unavoidable in telling this story a it should be told ; no gratuitous violence . And you do have to listen carefully if you 're not used to a Scottish accent . One important point that make this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized ; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scene . It 's their skill a actor that attracts you , they do n't rely on marquee name , popularity or sex symbol appeal . This is something special .",1
"When i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scene of miss world . She ha beautiful and charming body . When cute lady do bed scene and show her fully nude body ... i think male have hard to resist .... i think it time for cute girl like hrishita bhatt also do nude scene . At least no one want to c nude body of ugly woman like Seema biswas to c in bandit queen.I concur with what mallicka.b ha said . The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content . Emotions are n't conveyed properly . I guess a couple of not-so-good performance also contributed to it mediocrity . In my view , Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai . In some of her scene , she look a bit lusty , which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed . I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scene . I 'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai : ) Ca n't help it ; sorry for that . 'Raincoat ' wa a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh . And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat ; I wa not at all impressed",1
They 've shown i twice in a very short time now here in Sweden and I am so very tired of it . The bad acting is n't enough ... The story itself is so boring and the effect hardly exists . I love the original from 1953 so I recommend you to go and rent that one instead . Because this one is such a bore .,0
"Having seen Carlo Lizzani 's documentary on Luchino Visconti , I wa bound to higher expectation before watching this film made three year later by Adam Low . But the viewer like me did get dissatisfied ... I faced a need for critical opinion , which I generally do n't like giving due to the fact there are no documentary that will satisfy every viewer . There are also no documentary that will examine a theme totally . But when I read the review already written on this title , I also felt a bit confused . People sometimes do n't know what to criticize . Therefore , to be clear , I 'll divide this film into two major part that differ considerably : the former one about Visconti before his director 's career and latter one about Visconti the director . The aristocratic background , all the hobby , the wealth that young Luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented . His effort in horse racing is mentioned a well a his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parent ' divorce . We also get a very accurate idea of where Luchino wa brought up a a real count of Milano : in rich galore , with nanny , cook with access to everything , in TRUE ARISTOCRACY . For instance , his father 's splendid villa at Grazzano and other marvelous villa prove that . There is also an emphasis on Visconti 's crucial visit in Paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people ( `` left winger '' ) who later had impact on his style and message in art . That clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing ( a contrast at first sight ) . However , the part about his director 's career , which started with OSSESSIONE during WWII and ended with INNOCENTE just before the director 's death in 1976 , is poorly executed . His movie are not discussed well . Why ? Because there are very few people who really have something to say . Franco Zeffirelli , the director , remembers the work on LA TERRA TREMA and that is all right . There are also some interview with Franco Rosi . But later , such movie like IL GATTOPARDO , LA CADUTA DEI REI , LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger . Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig , I did not like the interview of his . Moreover , some thought he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary ... There is no mention of significant work of Visconti like CONVERSATION PIECE , there are no interview with eminent cast Burt Lancaster . A mention about Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made . There is one footage interview with Maria Callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit . Franco Zeffirelli , though I appreciate him a a director , make fun of it all rather than say something really precious . For instance , he mention the event how Visconti separated from him after year of service . Therefore , I say : simplified and unsatisfactory . What I find a strong point here are footage interview with Visconti himself . As a result , we may get his own opinion about his work . For instance , I very much appreciate the word he say about death regarding it a a normal chapter of life and a natural a birth itself . He also discus his health problem after the stroke while filming LUDWIG . I believe it is better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI ( 1999 ) by Carlo Lizzani than this doc . Although it is shorter and condensed a a whole , you will get a better idea of the director . Visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people 's emotion and viewpoint into stone ... 4/10",0
"Time is precious . This film is n't . I must learn to ignore critic who rave about small film like Fargo and this complete waste of time . The theater wa packed and everyone left with the same reaction : Is this the film the critic are raving about ? What a piece of crap ! The hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family . Get it ? The acting is superb . The production ( lighting , set , editing , sound ) is about 2 step above a 60 minute story . The character are shallow and unintelligent . I wa insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what wa blatantly obvious to the audience ; the audience wa murmuring to the movie screen what the character should say next . I have had more fun doing the laundry .",0
"worst . movie . ever made . EVER . I have no word to say about it .. other then it truly had no point , no plot , no ... anything . sheer crap ! ! ! I do n't know how everyone in the movie did n't shoot them shelf after watching it .... .... .... ... .. I love vampire flick and mystery , and alternate abstract outside the box film , and .... this wa non of those . I mean what the crap ! ! ! I cant even tell you what the film wa about cuz I still do n't know , and I just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it ... bottom line .. I think the maker of this film just want everyone to do drug . thats the only thing I got from this film . please do n't watch this ... I mean for a `` sultry sensual vampire flick '' there wa n't even the to be expected nudity you 'd get from a vamp flick . anyway back to my point .... this movie blow . go set yourself on fire instead .... .. ..",0
"Savage Island ( 2003 ) is a lame movie . It 's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting . Not only that the storyline and script wa wretched . I do n't know why this movie wa made . I have seen a lot of flick in my time and the one I really hate are movie that make me angry . This one made my blood boil . The situation were inane at best . If I made a movie like this it would have been a short . Really because those backwood `` idjits '' would n't have been in the picture . Do n't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D . I am an avid watcher of bad cinema . But this movie is virtually unwatchable . I do n't mind movie being shot on D.V . but if you 're going to do that make the movie enjoyable , not some tired retread of superior horror film ( sans Wrong Turn ) . I have to not recommend this waste of disk . If you come across this one in the rental store pas on by . Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1 .",0
I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time . I have seen it well over 100 time ( actually had to buy a new copy a a result of overwatching ) It is what the eighty wa like and what a romantic story with a few moral thrown in . I highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high school day again . Buy a copy now it is a classic ! ! ! !,1
"I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning . I 'm going to assume that one 's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one 's level of acceptance of Joseph 's story . However , that aside it wa very well made , well acted , and had a nice score . If you get to Salt Lake City , it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater . I have never been in a nicer theater a far a picture quality , sound quality and ambiance in my entire life ... I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there ! Being that I 'm LDS and regard Joseph a a prophet , I wa touched in several place and wa brought to tear quite a few time ... which I presume is expected since they handed out tissue BEFORE the movie started ! Anyway , I 'm told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe , if you have 70 minute check it out because whether you believe Joseph Smith or not , he tell a fascinating story .",1
"Adenoid Hynkel , a lowly soldier in World War One , rise in subsequent year to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania . He creates an aggressive , antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache . Sound like anyone you know ? From the safety of Hollywood , Chaplin us this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arm and defy Hitler and Mussolini . Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it , and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe 's civil strife ( remember , it wa Hitler who declared war on the USA , not the other way round ) it is surprising that Chaplin wa allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic . The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides , and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly , humane , brave , etc. , etc , Chaplin is Hynkel , and he also play The Jewish Barber , the little hero of the ghetto ( The Tramp in all but name ) . Needless to say , Chaplin writes , directs , star , composes the music and doe the catering . In 1940 the full truth wa not yet known about the Third Reich , and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something le than perfect historical foresight , but even by the standard of the day he get Hitler badly wrong . A comedian and a sentimentalist , Chaplin try to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless . All this doe is to humanise him . When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fool around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane , he becomes endearing rather than despicable . As dictator , he inspects his subordinate ' technical innovation which do n't work ( the parachute hat , the bulletproof uniform etc . ) and these passage are meant to make u think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside . In fact , Hynkel 's regime is made cute and likeable by it bumbling bodgery . In truth , Chaplin 's day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic . At heart , he wa still a dinosaur of the silent screen ( check out the humour , with gag like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious , or the pantomime of the coin in the pudding ) . The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged , but Schultz look more like a character from operetta than a Nazi . Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure ( if such had existed ) would say to the Fuehrer 's face , `` your cause is doomed to failure because it 's built upon the stupid , ruthless persecution of innocent people '' ? And how doe Schultz come to be in the cellar of the jewish ghetto ? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt , why doe he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform ? Chaplin did not yet know the full horror of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka , but the Nazi concentration camp which he offer u is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age . As usual , Chaplin think in term of 'silent ' comedy set-pieces , loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line . There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers , shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms , and the globe ballet ( watch for the segment filmed in reverse ) . Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah . Just a the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice , and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic , so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true . Brave , defiant , resourceful , hardworking and ( of course ) beautiful , she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage . `` Gee , ai n't I cute ? '' she asks , after the Barber give her a make-over . Too cute by far , is the answer . She doe n't come close to ringing true , because Chaplin ha made her a caricature . The 'would n't it be wonderful ? ' speech which Chaplin put into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy , too emotionally cloying . Jack Oakie is great a Napaloni , the fascist dictator of Bacteria . He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceeding , but the film 's underlying weakness remains . If Napaloni is silly and ineffective , how can we fear him ? And anyway , the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond it comic worth . And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform ?",0
"`` Milo '' is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.Do we really need more slasher ? I for one think we already have more than enough.I guess the professional tall guy overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that 's also a zombie or a ghost when he feel like it.A long time ago , he drowned but that did n't bother him and he still kill people ( `` Friday the 13th '' , what 's that ? ) .One day , his survivor have a big reunion and a a surprise twist , Milo come to pay them a visit.Through some really bad shot that show everything except the murder the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out Milo 's dull , I mean dark secret.She and her friend have been dying to know.Once discovered , Milo go on yet another murderous rampage ( is n't it his bedtime yet ? ) and the girl , well she scream a lot.The acting is not even bottom of the barrel , the barrel refuse to be associated with it.Milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time I give him that , but some movie just ca n't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity .",0
"This is one of the best horror / suspense film that Hollywood ha made in year or maybe even decades.Even though in my opinion this movie wa predictable in part , it ha everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL , THRILLS , AND yes a lot of GORE ! ! HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS ! ! ! In part it wa sort of far-fetched , the acting wa not that great , but my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten ...... if you enjoy being at the edge of your seat , this is just the right movie for you , I have to admit , it wa sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax ...... I myself enjoy these museum , but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way !",1
"Never saw the original movie in the series ... I only hope it wa a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980 's a if it is not how were these two terrible sequel even justified . This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent station that are a thing of the past now . Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie . It wa , however , a movie that would make some Walt Disney movie look dark . Really , this movie wa just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen . The only real sighting is near the end when you see it shape during a very heavy rainstorm , other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which wa really disappointing a a kid . The story is basically the old evil hunter must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kid are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the wood that like to pull random boat through the water . Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original , granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80 's , but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70 's `` The Town the Dreaded Sundown '' .",0
"Created in 1928 , and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name ( because his wife convinced him ) , Mickey Mouse ha become the staple of the Disney brand . I always thought this cartoon wa the first ever cartoon to feature Mickey , it is in fact his third , but it doe n't matter , for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable . The story see Mickey piloting a steamboat until Captain Pete take him off the bridge , stopping to pick up cargo , and Minnie Mouse missing the boat . Being lifted on she drop her music sheet and a goat eats them , Mickey help her crank it 's tail and play the tune , and getting some other animal to be percussion , until Pete come along again to stop him , making Mickey peel potato . Mickey Mouse wa number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and he wa number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Very good !",1
"Highly regarded at release , but since rather neglected . Immense importance in the history of performing art . A classic use of embedded plot . One of my favourite film . Why ha n't the soundtrack been re-released ?",1
"The perfect murder is foiled when a wife ( played by Mary Ellen Trainor , once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis , who helmed this episode ) , who murder her husband with a poker , ha the misfortune of receiving a visitor a she is about to move the body outside .. an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit ( played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake ) . She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband 's corpse . She decides to use an ax , once she down the Santa killer who miss several chance to chop off the woman 's head , to frame the killer for her husband 's murder . Santa killer lock her in a closet and pursues the woman 's daughter a she try desperate to free herself to save the child . This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old `` Santa kill '' theme while also adding the oft-used ( add nauseum ) woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine . It 's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kill while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac . There 's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much go through the motion . Not one of the show 's highlight .",0
"The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film . It should have read 'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family 's church at 8 year old , listening to the preacher drone on about God 's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego ' . It start off well intentioned , building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clue such a Renny 's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast ? ' moment . It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree , sacrificing it plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble . I believe I counted the use of the word 'pray ' about 53 time in a five minute span near the end . After the 31st , I tried to twist the context of the word to it synonym , 'prey ' . Sadly , this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minute . Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer ' ( 'preyer ' to me ) a it became totally zany . Indeed , even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom , almost to the point of ending up on the floor . For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 star , I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standard like Circle Square , The Ten Commandments , anything from Narnia , Jesus Christ Superstar and the like . Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in film such a Jesus Camp , The God Who Was n't There , What Would Jesus Buy , or the soon-to-be released Religulous . Maybe Robert Whitlow 's book is better .",0
"TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickford 's film . At two hour , it wa quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 year after it wa filmed . Mary give one of her finest performance at time the role seems like a `` greatest hit '' performance with bit of Mary the innocent , Mary the little devil , Mary the little mother , Mary the spitfire , Mary the romantic heroine , etc . characteristic that often were used throughout a single film in the past . The movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character 's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary is thought the unwed mother in question ! If the Academy Awards had been around in 1922 , no doubt the Best Actress Oscar for the year would have been Mary 's .",1
"I first saw this movie when I wa about 10 year old . My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it wa on sale for $ 5 on VHS . She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brother to watch . This movie , however , scared the hell out of me . You may be asking yourself , how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone ? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minion , Pitch , to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas . That 's right , Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause . Pitch stalk Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rise on Christmas day , for if Santa doe n't make it back to his home in space , he turn to powder . Do n't get me wrong , the movie is funny and fairly entertaining , however , the image of demon and devil dancing in the depth of hell ( which occurs at the beginning of the movie ) is just downright creepy .",0
"Although there are some snippet in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform , these are not very well-developed , in contrast to the many snippet from those who feel that the drug that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drug . Although this program , a a whole , leaf the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money , and for that it deserves some praise , almost nothing in this documentary address the very real problem that total war against those who merely posse illegal drug obviously cause and contributes to -- very real problem that most drug warrior themselves would tell you , if asked , they think the drug war is designed to solve . For example , while many minute are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80 's , at no point doe this program even hint that the very law designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug seller to enforce their contract and business arrangement in court of law , forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business . But instead of seeing the law a an important cause of the violence , the drug themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame . Inexplicably , alcohol prohibition , the violence that ensued , and the subsequent reversal of prohibition , is totally ignored by this program . This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotype of drug user , and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war . The possibility of incorporating drug other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on . Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problem , but not all user do their drug in excess , just like not all alcohol user are alcoholic . If you want a point of view from someone who belief that adult have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their life ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drug that the government , for mostly very arbitrary political reason rather than reason based on sound social policy and legitimate science , ha decided to totally prohibit , whose user it ha decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against , just forget about it . None of that is in here . On the other hand , this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda . It is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drug in 20th century United States like marijuana , LSD , heroin , cocaine , MDMA , and Oxycontin . But there is a significant element of various people 's point of view with regard to drug law , and most ( but not all ) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality , especially with respect to drug other than marijuana . The criminal justice system , along with it often harsh life-ruining penalty , is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem , but unfortunately there 's an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptom are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it come to certain drug , a lack of compassion for fellow human , a prejudice against people who use the drug that are not governmentally-approved , perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry , and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity . It 's morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so , and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drug is clearly not such a reason . This is really the primary issue when it come to drug , yet this program ignores it . So , in sum , the part of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotype of drug user that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining . But when it come to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy , and giving the viewer example not only of people with drug problem but also the many people who successfully incorporate drug into happy and successful life , it 's pretty disappointing .",0
"Considering this film wa released 8 year before I wa born , I do n't feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time . Back in January of 98 though , I attended the Second Annual Quentin Tarantino film fest held in Austin , Texas . The particular theme of film this night wa `` Neglected 70 's Crime Films '' and boy wa her right . `` The Gravy Train ( or The Dion Brothers , a it appeared this print ) '' wa an absolute gem . Wonderful performance , quirky character , smart plot , hilarious comedy , and just an all around great time . Rarely do you see a Crime film that is so entertaining and fresh . Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film appearance is extremely sexy a well . I hope some cable network get a hold of this film and allows many more to see it . In the meantime , go to an indie video store and hope they have it .",1
"The movie wa actually a romantic drama based on three sister who had desire to become a famous girl group . In their endeavor , the oldest sister meet a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin , whom Sister go after because she belief he is the `` big time '' who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life . Though he could be accused of killing her , he really kill only her spirit and will to live , after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dy from an overdose . The story is n't about the street life or the Italian mobster who try to buy Stix off , then threatens him , it 's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedy in life a portrayed in song and style and the character that wa the life in the time for young woman trying to be `` discovered '' back then .",1
"First , I realize that a `` 1 '' rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst . This movie get that from me because , a one reviewer point out , it 's not bad in a self-aware , over-the-top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value . It simply miss it mark on every count . * * Contains possible spoiler * * The dialog is completely disingenuous . The continuity is so deliberate it 's painful . Daniel just finish speaking of his lost love , and with his final word the flamenco dancer start . The mock-shock of what 's her name ( see ? I do n't even remember her character 's name , let alone the name of the forgettable actress ) when her husband ( the Baldwin ) first tell her that her friend is the bad guy . The car and the motorcycle chase did all the right thing . Vegetable cart gone flying . Cars crashing into each other . Motorcycles going down the stair . People nearly being hit , but remarkably , no one is . Oh , that 's right ... except for the one guy who ha been stabbed several time , is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wound , and an approaching car apparently did n't notice him there . Hmmm . It 's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movie like this can be made . There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money , you 'd think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good film worth seeing . Now there 's a novel idea . My suggestion : do n't see this film . Do n't rent the DVD . Do n't watch it on cable . There are lot of other thing you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied .",0
"Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriter sit around a table and one say `` let have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public ( also black ) in the street and ask him if he is black , then walk away '' . The other writer fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode . More laughter . Now if you think the premise is funny , and the show contains many such type of situation , you will enjoy this show . For the rest , use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry . Those that have written glowing report of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedy that are really funny . Another example of the humor in the show , a girl try to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier . Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different show with different cashier ? I could give other example but these just might be treated a spoiler , divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all .",0
"The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed production of H. G. Wells ' great novel , `` War of the Worlds '' . This is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them . No other version of WotW ha ever attempted not only to present the story very much a Wells wrote it , but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it wa supposed to take place : the last year of the 19th Century , 1900 using Wells ' original setting , in and near Woking , England . IMDb seems unfriendly to what they regard a `` spoiler '' . That might apply with some film , where the ending might actually be a surprise , but with regard to one of the most famous novel in the world , it seems positively silly . I have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal work in English literature , so let 's get right to the chase . The alien are destroyed through catching an Earth disease , against which they have no immunity . If that 's a spoiler , so be it ; after a book and 3 other film ( including the 1953 classic ) , you ought to know how this end . This film , which follows Wells ' plot in the main , is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewer off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th Century photography . Although filmed in a widescreen aspect , the film go to some length to give an impression of contemporaneity . The general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photograph ( rather than black ) . Colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting . At other time , color are washed out . These variation are typical of early film , which did n't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many change in print quality , even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on  a you 'll see on occasion here . The special effect are deliberately retrograde , of a sort seen even a late a the 1920s  and yet the Martians and their machine are very much a Wells described them and have a more nearly realistic `` feel '' . Some of effect are really awkward  such a the destruction of Big Ben . The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours . Some aspect of Victorian dress may appear odd , particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair . This film is the only one that follows with some closeness Wells ' original narrative  a ha been noted . Viewers may find it informative to note plot detail that appear here that are occasionally retained in other version of the story . Wells ' description of the Martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacle  is effectively portrayed . When the Martian machine appear , about an hour into the film , they too give a good impression of how Wells described them . Both Wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the Martians from the limited perspective ( primarily ) of rural England  plus a few scene in London ( involving the Narrator 's brother ) . The director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark ( Big Ben ) , but at least doe n't dwell unduly on the devastation of London . The victory of the Martians is hardly a surprise , despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machine . The Narrator , traveling about to seek escape , see much of what Wells term `` the rout of Mankind '' . He encounter a curate endowed with the Victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality . They eventually find themselves on the very edge of a Martian nest , where they discover an awful fact : the Martians are shown to be vampire who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene . Wells add that after eating they set up `` a prolonged and cheerful hooting '' . The Narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just a the Martians drag him off to the larder ( cheer from the gallery ; British curate are so often utterly insufferable ) . This film last almost 3 hour , going through Wells ' story in welcome detail . It 's about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that build in dramatic impact . A word about the acting : Do n't expect award-winning performance . They 're not bad , however , the actor are earnest and they grow on you . Most of them , however , have had very abbreviated film career , often only in this film . The Narrator is played by hunky Anthony Piana , in his 2nd film . The Curate is John Kaufman  also in his 2nd film a an actor but who ha had more experience directing . The Brother ( `` Henderson '' ) is played with some conviction by W. Bernard Bauman in his first film . The Artilleryman , the only other sizable part , is played by James Lathrop in his first film . This is overall a splendid film , portraying for the first time the War of the Worlds a Wells wrote it . Despite it slight defect , it is far and away better than any of it hyped-up competitor . If you want to see H. G. Wells ' War of the Worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film !",1
"Of the element that make this the best at this point , I have to say # 1 is Christine McIntire . Shemp 's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent . I imagine that , a one poster suggested , Christine wa trying to hold back laughter during that scene , but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil , to be smiling at Shemp 's possibly dying . Another character who help this stand out is the Goon . His look wa a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball . Hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or , for that matter anywhere . I would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this , but hey , when a short is this good , who 's going to complain . Not I .",1
"Okay this is stupid , they say their not making another Nightmare film , that this is the `` last '' one ... And what do they do ? They go on making another one , not that the next one ( part7 ) wa BAD , but why do they play u . Anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever , it wa extremelly dull , the character were highly one dimensional , Freddy wa another joker , which is very stupid for such a good series.The plot is very , very bad , and this is even worse than part 2 and 5 . I didnt get the movie , it a stupid tale in 3-d , pointless ! Id say . I hated this film so much i still rmember all the part i didnt like which wa basically the whole film.This is SO different than the prequels , it try , and try , but this one tried the hardest , and got slapped back on the face.Again there were hadly any death scene , although they were different , they sucked bigtime . How can they have gone this far ? Didnt they see they made the biggest mistake at part 2 and 5 ? Yet they make this ? Its all bout the money , DO NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES . I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX ( 6 ) 3 out of 10 . GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE : Had potential with plot . BAD POINTS OF FILM : Terrible acting/lack of deaths/Too funny to be classified a horror/very confusing .",0
"Everyone , my name may sound weird , but there wa nothing else ! Any way , I have n't seen anything like this before so it wa crazy ! Of course that 's a good thing . It is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other thing into one ! Like chicken little , , the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying , `` Twas beauty who killed the beast '' , War of the world scene and more . Walt Disney company ha NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one . Also , how they made it like they were watching a movie and it wa like a home cinema . However some part do n't fit . Like in the original lion king , were n't Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he beat Scar ? In this movie , they are not ! they were fighting the hyena backstage . Ther 's more , the reason being why Pumbaa is n't so confident is because he wa pushed away by the other animal and also , it 's just Timon , Timon , Timon . Anybody realise that only Timonn 's story wa told , whereas pumbaa only had flashback ? But apart from that , IT '' S GREAT !",1
"Finally wa there released a good Modesty Blaise movie , which not only tell a story , but actually tell the `` real '' story . I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller , but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectation . Then you will notice that it is a story that come very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell . You have a cover story just to tell about how Modesty became the magnificent person which she is . It is not a movie to attract new fan , but a movie to tell the real tale . Some thing could have been better , but when you can not forget the awful movie from '66 then is this a magnificent movie . So are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make Modesty tell her story .",1

"I decided to watch this movie because I 'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie . I 'm sorry it had to be this one because , quite frankly , this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn , both of whom were great actor . The problem with the film is simple : it try to put too much , too quickly , in to a story about a young lawyer ( John Manson played by Stewart ) who marries Jane ( played by Lombard ) within an hour of meeting her . What 's that cliché ? Marry in haste , repent at leisure ... In short , the story is a series of episode that show the couple ' worsening financial status , their trouble with John 's live-in mother , their struggle to pay the bill , John 's diminished status at the office , the arrival of their baby son , John Jnr ( unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother ) , the couple ' angst about their marriage , the baby 's sickness which worsens , thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot ( in a fierce storm ) to bring a special serum to save the child , and finally John being accepted a a junior partner at the law firm . How many more clichéd situation could the writer include ? Maybe Mother dying soon after ? There wa n't much comedy ; the drama wa lacklustre , at best ; the dialog wa painful to hear . Only the acting of the four main player wa adequate . This wa the period at the end of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of it long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the event portrayed in the movie . So , it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good ol ' home spun American value of family , relationship , heroism , perseverance , and initiative  all against the backdrop of the `` average '' American family . Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard ? And , it should be noted that the film wa released in early 1939 ; so , it wa planned in 1938  soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II . Hence , this sort of film wa a great booster for the general public , at that time , many of who would soon have to join England in war . As many here would know , Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before , during and after the war . However , I 'm glad I saw it  a a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda . But , I 'll have to see other Lombard film to gain a better appreciation of her acting range . As another reviewer noted : see this one just to say that you 've seen all of Stewart 's movie ; otherwise , do n't bother .",0
"Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there 's nothing to spoil about that movie.Even if B. Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director . But for the last 10 year he seemed to have lost it.This film is just empty , nothing at all to wake u up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.No sex , no blood ( it 's suppose to be about snuff ? ) , no actor , no dialog , just a bad a an 90'T.V film.It 's even worse than his last cannibal and zombie epics.So Rest in peace Bruno , you will stay in our mind forever anyway , thanks to such unforgettable gem a : Zombi 3 , Robowar , Rats , l'altro inferno , Virus , Cruel jaw and few others.So except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Franco 's spirit 's new film , pas on this one.But if you do n't know this nice artisan 's career track down his old film and have fun .",0

"Hypothetical situation abound , one-time director Harry Ralston give u the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead , left in the street , in the store , and throughout the landscape , sans in the middle of a forgotten desert . One lone survivor , attempting to rekindle his sanity , take food from the city to his bungalow in this desert . All alone , he hope for more , but with nobody around , he is left with white underwear , and a passion for a local Indian tribe  until the discovery of a camera which open up new door and break the barrier of human co-existence . Alan , a man of the book , is left on Earth after an unknown disaster . Thinking he is alone , he begin living life his way  until , Jeri Ryan , appears ( like she would in any dream ) out of the wood , disheveled , and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like Alan . Anyway , they try to co-exist , fail , get drunk , and before creating the ultimate dystopia , they run into Redneck Raphael ( played by newcomer  Dan Montgomery Jr ) . Bonds are torn , confusion set in , a couple becomes a third wheel , and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock . Even with nobody left on the planet , it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise . Using a variable film technique , Ralston give u a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled `` The Quiet Earth '' ( which I will be viewing next ) oddly which he never give any credit towards . With a borrowed story , I guess he doe a decent job of reinterpreting it . His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while Ralston try to find his stride , borrowing yet again from other film director 's technique to attempt to find his own . He open the film interestingly enough , but fails to answer any direct answer . Sure , the final day have arrived , but could there be a concise answer a to `` how '' or better yet `` why '' these select few survived . A spookier beginning would have led u stronger into a comical film . The juxtaposition would have been like `` Shawn of the Dead '' , but instead left u feeling like we were watching a `` made-for-TV '' program . Listening to the audio commentary , I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made , and his passion nearly sell the film , but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wa n't a happy with his overall final product . There were mistake , one that he pointed out and others that he wa ashamed to point out . While this doe make for decent independent film-making , it sometimes feel cheap , and in Ralston 's case , it wa the latter . I must admit , David Arnott 's portrayal of Alan hooked me . He played that wimpy , school nerd , adult role very well . He wa funny to both watch and listen to , and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer . He wa a key player in keeping the film together , ala , I can not say the same for the rest . This wa Dan Montgomery 's first film , and it wa obvious  I mean  really really obvious . There were scene in which I thought the cue card wa about to come out and read the line for him , perhaps even giving u a more realistic performance , but ala , it wa n't the case . Then there wa Jeri Ryan . She pulled into her character near the end of the film , which to me , wa the culmination of the entire piece of art . She go from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end . Confused ? Again , she fell into her character by the end , giving u just a glimpse of what she could have probably done a her acting matured . Even a the commentary progressed , all that she contributed wa a laugh , giggle , or `` ohhh , look at that color '' moment . While her beauty may sell ticket , one may want to consider knowledge to be just a beautiful . This wa her first film , so can I be too harsh ? Overall , this film felt like it wa missing something . I though the idea wa strong  the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the Earth the evil of human nature still exists . Jealousy can not be killed by bacteria or bomb ( maybe because it is consumed by zinc ? ) and we a a race will always want what we can not have . Ralston is not a surprising director , his technique are flawed and pre-used , but he doe know how to make a low-budget comedy . I think our idea of `` funny '' is different , so that is why I could n't find myself laughing at many of the bit he found `` hysterical '' . His actor provided the level of acting needed for this film , which wa lower than average . His film wa loose , meaning that there were element never quite explained or tackled ( i.e . anything with wing survived ? ! ? ) , which overall harmed the intensity of the film . This wa a comedy , but it could have been much darker and much much funnier . For those thinking that Roger Avery wa a huge element to this film , a we learn from their commentary , all he wa there for wa money  the wa in essence , the bank for `` The Last Man '' . Do n't get your hope up for any classic Avery moment . Do n't expect more from Ralston  and that is how I will end it . Grade : * * out of * * * * *",0
"I must admit , I wa expecting something quite different from my first viewing of 'Cut ' last night , though wa delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem . I am a true horror fan a true a they come , and found 'Cut ' to not only be the best of the genre Australia ha ever produced , but one of the great parody/comedy film of late . My only concern is that mainstream audience may not pick up on a lot of the comedic element - the film wa not overly clever in it 's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in EVERY possible cliche of the horror genre they could . I am certain this wa intended a humour .... hoping this wa intended a humour . And of course , there wa the gore . The use of the 'customised ' garden shear wa brilliance - besides the expected stab and slash . In short , there wa a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent death , enough to please even the skeptic of this film worth . The appearance of both Kylie Minogue ( short that her appearance wa ) and Molly Ringwald wa just another reason to see the film - both performance were fantastic , a well a Simon Bossell ( 'The Castle ' ) in a brilliant role a the jokey technician . All in all , I think this movie is one of the best horror product of the last couple or year , a well a a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end . Loved it . Go see it !",1
"I am so happy not to live in an American small town . Because whenever I 'm shown some small town in the States it is populated with all kind of monster among whom flesh hungry zombie , evil alien and sinister ghost are most harmless . In this movie a former doctor , who 's just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash , directs his step to the nearest small town - he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small town - which happens to be the Purgatory Flats . And , of course , a soon a he arrives there all the hell break loose . He meet a blond chick who out of all creature most resembles a cow both in facial expression and in brain functioning and at once fall in love with her . But there is a tiny handicap , she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute get himself shot pitifully not dead . To know what ha come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself . I 'll just tell you that it 's slightly reminiscent of U Turn by Oliver Stone but is a way down in all artistic property .",1
"Like anyone else who bought this , I wa duped by the `` 20 piece of extreme gore '' and `` banned in 20 country '' or whatever it say in the box . I have to admit I am a huge gore fan and I am always amazed when film can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it . Tom Savini , Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business . The revolutionized make-up effect in the 80 's . Today , you do n't need them a everything is done on computer . But computer can not compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up . But I digress . Watching fantastically gory film like Fulci 's Gates to Hell or even Savini 's crowning achievement , Friday the 13th the Final Chapter , you can appreciate all that go into making a terrifically gory film . You ca n't tell the difference between reality and magic . I ca n't imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film . If that is the reason you seek this film , then you are wasting your money . As many other reviewer in here have noted , most of the gore is an aftermath . You do n't see the torture , or the bloodshed a it happens , you see whatever it look like afterwords . The gore ? Well , it 's here , but not a much a one would hope , or expect . A man doe get castrated and a woman doe get hanged by her breast , but other then those two scene , and one involving a scalping ; there is nothing really much else to this film . The scene of gore even in these three mentioned , are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for . Maybe it 's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre , but I wa expecting a bit more . Call me sick or twisted , but is n't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place ? I honestly found myself bored in a lot of place . Cannibal Ferox is just another film that try to capitalize on a craze of a superior film . While Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great film , it is much better than this tripe . If you go out of your way to buy this for $ 20.00 , you will feel cheated . 3/10",0
"I always felt that Ms. Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skill . Familiar to million a the Lt. on Law and Order , she ha been seen in a number of theatrical release , always in a supporting role . HBO 's Lackawanna Blues change that and allows this talented actress to shine a Nanny , successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration . But the story is really about the colorful array of character that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna , New York , a suburb of Buffalo . The story could be set in any major African-American community of the 50 's and 60 's from Atlanta 's Sweet Auburn to New York 's Harlem . But the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful life of the folk at Nanny 's boarding house . The story revolves around Nanny 's relationship with all kind of people , played by some of the best actor in the business ( I purposely did not say black actor -- this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black , except for Jimmy Smits , of course ) I recommend this film a a fun and colorful look at a bygone day .",1
"This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year , a few too many coincidence and plot hole . However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddy so a few vagary should n't come a too much of a surprise . Brosnan is excellent in this role , gone is the wooden James Bond ( a role he wa wasted in ) . If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedy . Greg Kinnear is also excellent a Brosnan 's straight man . I 've read a few negative comment in here about Hope Davis but I thought she wa quite good a a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within . There are lot of good chuckle a Brosnan sleaze his way through and a few scene where I nearly died laughing . My father ( a consultant ) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself a a `` facilitator '' . Much like `` Grosse Pointe Blank '' , another hit-man comedy , the humour can be very dark . If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself .",1
"As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones , I thought this might be interesting . Not so , a this film is very 'of it age ' , in the 1960 's . To me ( someone born in the 1980 's ) this just look to me a hippy purist propaganda crap , but I am sure this film wa not made for me , but people who were active during th '60 's . I expected drug galore with th Stones , I wa disappointed , it actually showed real life , hard work in the studio , So much so I felt a if I wa working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film . I have not seen any of the director other film , but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing , sort of 'amatuerish ' which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash , badly directed , tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value . My only good opinion of this is that I did n't waste money on it , it came free with a Sunday paper .",0
"Watch the Original with the same title from 1944 ! This made for TV movie , is just god-awful ! Although it doe use ( a far a I can tell ) almost the same dialog , it just doe n't work ! Is it the acting , the poor directing ? OK so it 's made for TV , but why watch a bad copy , when you can get your hand on the superb original ? Especially a you 'll be spoiled to the plot and wo n't enjoy the original a much , a if you 've watched it first ! There are a few thing that are different from the original ( it 's shorter for once ) , but all are for the worse ! The actor playing the part here , just do n't fit the bill ! You just do n't believe them and who could top Edward G. Robinsons performance from the original ? If you want , only watch it after you 've seen the original and even then you 'll be very brave , if you watch it through ! It 's almost sacrilege !",0
"Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film . It is starkly shot , graphic without being visually graphic , well-acted by all concerned , and cover some of the most taboo issue of any day in a workmanlike , almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer . I did n't know what to expect sitting down to watch this : a civil war movie or some kind of 70 's soft-core peddling with Eastwood descending on a school for girl in the South . But really is is neither of those thing but rather and examination , exploration , and descent into the soul of men and woman - a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized . a one reviewer previously noted , none - none - of the character are likable by the film 's end and yet each one is interesting , complex , and enigmatic . Eastwood play Cpl . McBurney , a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin ( you 'll recognize that voice a soon a you hear it ) , a girl at a school for manner headed by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos that wa the Civil War - particularly in the South . Soon , Page , teacher Elizabeth Hartman , lovely , young seductress Carol , and even Ferdin ( Amy ) have emotional/sexual tie to Eastwood - each having their own need and secret and problem . Eastwood is not a nice man . he play the girl off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage . In the unfolding we get some real interesting thing revealed from latent lesbianism to incest . The Beguiled , for me , is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectation on every creative front . This might be ( except for Invasion of the Body Snatchers ) Siegel 's best film . It certainly is one of Eastwood 's best REAL performance . page is always so very good and Hartman , Fe5rdin , et al excellent . the Gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic . Some of the sexual-laced scene disturbing . And what happens to Eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy , eerie , demented film .",1
"Anyone who lived through the age of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this film . It is one of those film that delivers everything you want in a `` spring break movie '' PLUS it make fun of the college film genre . It 's funny , it 's got a cast to die for ( Amy Pohler ! Rachel Dratch ! , Sophie Monk ! , Parker Posey ! Jane Lynch ! Amber Tamblyn ! Missi Pyle ! ) and it guaranteed to make you laugh out loud . Writer/ actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain . Wilson Phillips ! OMG ! ( I 'm just repeating myself now ... ) It will live on with girl who like Miranda July but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they 're dumb .",1
"Arguably the finest serial ever made ( no argument here thus far ) about Earthman Flash Gordon , Professor Zarkov , and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet . Along the way , in spellbinding , spectacular , and action-packed chapter Flash and his friend along with new found friend such a Prince Barin , Prince Thun , and the awesome King Vultan pool their resource together to fight the evil and army of the merciless Ming of Mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter Priness Aura ( now she 's a car ! ) . This serial is not just a cut above most serial in term of plot , acting , and budget - it is mile ahead in these area . Produced by Universal Studios it ha many former set at it disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few . The production value across the board are advanced , in my most humble opinion , for 1936 . The costume worn by many of these strange men and woman are really creative and first-rate . We get hawk-men , shark men , lion men , high priest , creature like dragon , octasacks , orangapoids , and tigrons ( oh my ! ) and many , many other fantastic thing . Are all of them believable and first-rate special effect ? No way . But for 1936 most are very impressive . The musical score is awesome and the chapter beginning are well-written , lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memory of the former chapter , and expertly scored . Director Frederick Stephani doe a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymond 's phenom comic strip . Lastly , the acting is pretty good in this serial . All too often serial have either no name with no talent surrounding one or two former talent - here most everyone ha some ability . Do n't get me wrong , this is n't a Shakespeare troupe by any mean , but Buster Crabbe doe a workmanlike , likable job a Flash . He is ably aided by Jean Arden , Priscella Lawson , and the rest of the cast in general with two performer standing out . But before I get to those two let me add a another reviewer noted , it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the Hayes Office . I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movie decade later . The short Crabbe ( and unfortunately for all of u Professor Zarkov ( ( Frank Shannon ) ) wear are about a form-fitting a pair of short guy can wear . The girl are wearing mid drift throughout and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell . Lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful . But for me the two actor that make the serial are Charles Middleton a Ming : officious , sardonic , merciless , and fun . Middleton is a class act . Jack `` Tiny '' Lipson play King Vultan : boisterous , rousing , hilarious - a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism . Lipson steal each and every scene he is in . The plot meander here , there , and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial , space opera , and the basis for load of science fiction to follow . Excellent !",1
"I have to say that the event of 9/11 did n't hit me until I saw this documentary . It took me a year to come to grip with the devastation . I wa the one who wa changing the station on the radio and channel on TV if there wa any talk about the tower . I wa sick of hearing about it . When this wa aired on TV a year and a day later , I wa bawling my eye out . It wa the first time I had cried since the attack . I highly recommend this documentary . I am watching it now on TV , 5 year later , and I am still cry over the tragedy . The fact that this contains one of the only video shot of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing . It wa an accident , and look where it got them . These two brother make me want to have been there to help .",1
"Perfect movie are rare . Even my favorite film tend to have flaw - Rear Window look a little stagey at time , Chris Elliot 's character in Groundhog Day doe n't work , the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy , the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish . The script is brilliant , the acting is superb all around ( although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing , the whole cast shine ) , the directing and the photography are inspired , and the music score is touching without being intrusive ( like some Miramax score that are too manipulative ) . Every sad moment is truly moving , every light moment make me smile . This truly is one of the best film I have ever seen and I wish there were more film like it . I am glad that Reese Witherspoon ha gone on to stardom after this film , but I am sorry to see that her recent movie are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people , real feeling and real problem . Brilliant ! A must-see .",1
"This ha to be one of the 5 worst movie ever made . The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57 . But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better . The plot ha been worked out in the worst possible way . Just a few of the awful moment in the movie , A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour wind ? ! ? Thereafter the land the aircraft from a few mile out starting at 8000 foot , thats impossible even for 747 pilot with thousand of hour experience . When on the runway ( perfectly straight of course ) she is instructed to pull on the flap , HUH ! ! Come on flap are there to ensure lift at low speed , when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engine and give maximum power ! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistake in the movie , but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary . This is a movie you want to miss , take my word for it !",0
"regardless of what anyone say , it a b-movie , and the effect are poorly done .. if you 're a vampire fanatic , I suppose it would be OK , not 10 out of 10 , you others here cant sincerely mean that ? . we are to view this a a movie , not read it a a book , so the effect and character are important , a well a the story . The story are good , but it doe n't carry the film , no wonder it ha a low rating over all . I write this because I chose to see this movie when I saw some good review here on IMDb , but got severely disappointed . do n't get me wrong , I thought the blade movie wa awesome , and loved the underworld movie , but this character are n't close . the make up on the vampire is poorly done , and the effect are worse . this suck . I might not have gotten so disappointed if I had not read review here that told me how great it wa . the reviewer must have had something to do with the production company or something , seriously , if you think this is awesome , you do n't care about acting or make up . this is better a a book . 3 out of 10 for an OK story ..",0
"I want very much to believe that the above quote ( specifically , the English subtitle translation ) , which wa actually written , not spoken , in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist , wa meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner . But if so , director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actor of the true nature of the film . They are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayal that I have to conclude Carax actually take himself seriously here , or else ha so much disdain for everyone , especially the viewing audience , that he ca n't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke . Some auteur are able to get away with making oblique , bizarre film because they do so with élan and unique personal style ( e.g. , David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky ) . Others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal element into the fabric of the story ( e.g. , Krzysztof Kieslowski , and David Cronenberg 's later , le bizarre work ) . In Pola X , Carax throw a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dare him to find fault with it . Well , here it is : the pacing is erratic and choppy , in particular continuity is often dispensed with ; superfluous character abound ( e.g. , the Gypsy mother and child ) ; most of the performance are overwrought ; the lighting is often poor , particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene ; unconnected scene are thrust into the film for no discernible reason ; and the list go on . Not to be completely negative , it should be noted that there were some uplifting exception . I liked the musical score , even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling , abandoned complex to which the main character retreat in the second half of the film ( perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol 's 'Factory ' of the '60s ? ) . Much of the photography of the countryside wa beautiful , an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city setting . And , even well into middle-age , Cathering Deneuve show that she still ha 'it ' . Her performance wa also the only one among the major character that did n't sink into bathos . There wa an earlier time when I would regard such film a `` Pola X '' more charitably . Experimentation is admirable , even when the experiment doe n't work . But Carax try nothing new here ; the film is a pastiche of element borrowed from countless earlier film , and after several decade of movie-viewing and literally thousand of film later , I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal , poorly crafted tripe . At this early moment in the 21st century , one is left asking : With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet , are there * any * director in France who know how to make a watchable movie anymore ? Rating : 3/10 .",0
"It 's hard to praise this film much . The CGI for the dragon wa well done , but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow . Also , the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridor which becomes slightly tedious . I wa amazed to see `` Marcus Aurelius '' in the acting credit , wondering what an ex-Emperor of the Roman Empire wa doing acting in this film ! Like `` Whoopie Goldberg '' it must be an alias , and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker . The story might been interesting , but the acting is flat , and direction is tedious . If you MUST watch this film , go around to your friend 's house and get drunk while doing so - then it 'll be enjoyable .",0
"I remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 with my parent , and being pretty into it at the time . Of course , I wa seven at the time . Right before the Jackson movie came out , my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I wa feeling nostalgic . Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie , and wa forced to drastically cut corner on this production . Since this movie wa done primarily with rotoscoping , the animation technique for people on a budget , this is saying something . Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word . There are some scene which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen , with maybe some animation effect superimposed on top of them . Because of budget constraint , the movie -- already a compression of `` The Fellowship of the Rings '' and part of `` The Two Towers '' -- wa pared down even more . What you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the Cliff Notes of the book . Its not all bad , though , the animation brings a warmth to it , that I found lacking in the Jackson movie . Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding . This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came . Several year later , a half-hearted half-hour long TV special wa aired , which wa meant to wrap thing up . All I will say about that is that it wa a musical .",0
"Just finished watching 2FTM . The trailer intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend , something I never do . Needless to say I wa very disappointed . The story ha so much potential and it 's frustrating to see it get screwed up . I really feel the problem with the movie wa the directing and Matthew McConaughey . First off I am not a MM hater , I thought he wa awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star . I enjoyed his performance in those movie without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 time . Yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body , but I think most people knew this 10 year ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill . Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 time in the movie is totally unnecessary . I think one time would have been sufficient . It would n't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scene in so girlfriend and wife would be willing to tag along with their significant other , no woman want to see a movie about sport gambling , unless ...... Enough about that , let 's get into his role . I feel his acting wa very forced and he did n't seem very comfortable . I know his character wa supposed to be this charming southerner , but his line were corny and cheesy . It wa almost like he wa referencing Days and Confused line a few time ! In short , I did n't like his character even though I wa supposed to . The accent , his shirt off , corny pick up line , weak sale pitch . His character wa just too much of a tool , a Brandon or Jonathan . Pacino and Assante were great , but that ' no surprise . Piven is fun to watch a Arie .... oooops I mean Jerry . I just feel this movie wa very commercial and put together poorly . It 's insulting that they could take a great story , and throw in crap ingredient to try and make it a box office success . 1 . Cool story that appeal to the male man 2 . Hunky Hollywood actor for female woman ( make sure he ha numerous scene with shirt off lifting weight ) 3 . Al Pacino with 4 great speech scene , and 25 great one liner 3 . Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollar suite and have an extremely dark tan 4 . Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4 . Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5 . Plot , good writing , character development , and intelligent casting are unnecessary This will be good enough for most people , but not me ! Anybody who disagrees with me , ask your self this . Would this movie be much better if : A . Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton a Brandon instead of MM I will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie suck . I realized this when the woman next to me started cry during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo . The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing . The movie going public get what the movie going public want , big budget crapola .",0
"I wa watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on . While not a bad a Wynorski 's `` Curse of the Komodo '' , this still suck ... BAD . Wynorski us the same island a in `` Curse of the Komodo '' , a well a the same actor and house . The effect are top notch ( suprising ) but thats about it ........ I do n't know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yeah ! As in `` Curse of the Komodo '' , the government get involved and decides to bomb the island ! Also .... when i saw this part i laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA ! ! ! ( part man , komodo AND cobra ! ) . Overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standard . Just remember if Jim Wynorski had anything to do with a movie .... steer clear .... to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating `` It 's almost over .. it 's almost over ... '' . 0 out of 5 .",0
"I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV advert , and to be honest , I did n't know how much I would like it . I switched on the TV last night and wa totally surprised . Driving Lessons is a modest , simple film which draw you in right from the start . Rupert Grint play the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly . He 's definitely one to look out for in the future . Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters . I loved the simple plot and the way the actor portrayed their character with great sensitivity . The highlight of the film , for me wa Evie 's rather colourful poem . It show how friendship can form between the most unlikely pair . In my opinion , watching Driving Lessons is a great way to spend 2 hour . The scenery wa also striking , especially the countryside . Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable , I strongly disagree with",1
"For Greta Garbo 's first talking picture , MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill 's Pultizer Prize winning 1921 play ANNA Christie . Also wisely , the producer backed Garbo up with not one but two member of the Original Broadway Cast ( George Marion a Anna 's father , Chris , and James T. Mack a Johnny the Priest - transmuted to `` Johnny the Harp '' for film so a not to offend ) . This little change is interesting . Like too many film accused ( by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origin ) of being `` little more than filmed stage play , '' the problem is not the play but the movie maker who would n't be more faithful to the property . By diluting a great cinematic stage work so it would n't offend anyone , or opening it up because they COULD , too many lose the very quality which made the piece worth filming in the first place . Fortunately , the respect the studio had for both O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marion 's generally sensitive screen adaptation . Wonder of wonder , Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where Garbo 's Anna reveals her past on `` the farm '' to the man she badly want to marry and the father who sent her there in tact ! What the League of Decency must have thought of that ! The source play 's greatest problem ha always been that Chris 's friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take stage - the two side of the genuinely good woman men do n't always recognize . The perfectly cast Marie Dressler ( who had cut her teeth on the Broadway stage a well before going to Hollywood ) is the perfect balance for Garbo 's Anna in this area a well and the fast moving film at only 90 minute , doe n't allow u too much time to miss her - one of the few benefit from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - AND screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from O'Neill to bring Dressler back for a touching scene two third of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Laverne 's second act appearance in SHOW BOAT . Anna and Marthy 's early scene together on screen ( 16 minute into the film ) taking each other 's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scene in the entire piece . Not to be missed . ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama . It 's hard to imagine that a latter day remake , which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake ( it wa first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with George Marion 's original Broadway Chris ) could improve on this excellent filming . The internal scene hew closest to the play , but the exterior should n't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere . While the background screen work is not to modern technical standard , the background give a better glimpse than most film of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set ( especially in the New York harbor ) . Nearly all Garbo 's naturalistic performance of the sound era have held up superbly ( only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE , 7 year later , will occasionally draw snicker because of the heavy handed direction and the parody ) , but this ANNA Christie , together with the variety of her 1932 film , MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL , and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy , NINOTCHKA ( `` Garbo laugh ! `` ) , surely stand a her best . O'Neill fan who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded `` sea play , '' should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the U.S. entered the conflict , THE LONG VOYAGE HOME ( 1940 ) . It is almost a skillfully drawn from those sea play a this one is from ANNA Christie , and feature a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare non-Westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actor showing him the way .",1
"Let me set the scene . It is the school holiday and there is absolutely nothing at the movie . I am with my friend deciding what to see . We look for a movie that is starting soon and `` The Grinch '' come up . We buy ticket not knowing what to expect . What we got wa a roller coaster of fun . Jim Carrey ( who may I add is my No.1 actor in the whole world ) wa absolutely magnificent a the Grinch in this Ron Howard 's best movie ( next to Apollo 13 ) . The way that this movie wa made , the scenery , the actor , the prop and the music wa just amazing . It really brought this childhood movie to life . The story is based upon the story of the grinch . As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just ca n't stand christmas . He life high above whoville and ha never mingled well with the townfolk . But one little girl is going to change The Grinch 's look on life and on others in a drastic way . Cindy Lou Who ( played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem ) meet the Grinch a find the kind part of him straight away . She attempt to break the barrier and to help the Grinch move in and mingle with the town people . All up this movie is a barrel of laugh for the whole family both kid and parent . A SOLID 10/10 . Well done Jim .",1
"As a long-time fan of all the Star Trek series , I found this a disappointing episode , and I wonder if the liberal use of `` flashback '' featuring Will Riker 's exploit , both positive ( and largely romantic ) and negative ( lot of pain , and a crewmate 's death ) wa a money-saving device , a were many of their `` bottle show '' ( episode in which all scene take place on the Enterprise ) . Diana Muldaur ( who also appeared at least twice on the original series ) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character , Dr. Kate Pulaski . Loyal viewer ( in the Star Trek world , is there any other kind ? ) also were shortchanged . This wa the last episode of second season ; thus , the season ended `` not with a bang '' but with `` a whimper . ''",0
"This TV-series wa one of the one I loved when I wa a kid . Even though I see it now through the pink-shaded glass of nostalgia , I can still tell it wa a quality show , very educational but still funny . I have not seen the original French version , only the Swedish . I have no idea how good the dubbing wa , it wa too long ago to remember . The premise of the show wa to show you how the body work . I swear , school still ha n't taught me half of what I know from this show . It also tied in other thing , like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and do n't exercise , with nice example within the body . Who want to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tank can invade you ? : D The cartoon looked nice , very kid friendly of course , but done with care . Cells , virus , electric signal in the brain , antibody and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figure , looking pretty much how you 'd expect what they should look like in the animated body . This , and the series about history ( especially the environmentally scary finale ) were key part of my childhood . I 'm so happy I found them here .",1
"Fans of the HBO series `` Tales From the Crypt '' are going to love this MOH episode . Those who know the basic archetypal story that most of the classic EC comic were based on , will recognize this one right off the bat . Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan ( also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplay for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER ) is the kind of guy whose everyman good look can go either way . He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door , or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness . In the case of RIGHT TO DIE , he take the latter approach , and it definitely work . Donovan is a doctor who ha recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist ( Robin Sydney ) , much to the displeasure of his inconsolable , unforgiving spouse , Abbey ( Julia Anderson ) . When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of `` making up , '' and she 's horribly burned in a fire , he 's reluctant to pull the plug on her , not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy ( Corbin Bernsen , looking the worse for wear these day . ) But Abbey 's never been one to give up without a fight , and that 's where the EC-theme of the episode come in . Cuckolded husband - and wife - have always been the genre 's favorite subject matter for some spooky ( and OOKY ) supernatural shenanigan , and this case is definitely no exception . If anything , the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere . And that 's not to mention that John Esposito 's original script doe give the adultery angle just a slight twist . You do n't realize a you 're watching that you only know half the story , until close to the end ... ( think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more gut and gazongas , and you 're there . ) Not a bad effort , but not the best of the lot , either . At least Rob Schmidt doe display touch of flair here and there with the direction , especially in a scene that make cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed ! As with most MOH episode , this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment , so the extremely squeamish need not apply .",1
"Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political , government , and well written T.V . Drama 's in the 25 year . The acting is superb , the writing is spectacular . Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a Nuclear , Biological , and Radiological Terrorist Attack here on American soil . Dirty War should be made into a major motion picture - It 's that good ! I highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth . This T.V . drama reveals how British Intelligence ( MI5 & MI6 ) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victim -because of England 's involvement in the Iraq War . The scene of different part of London , England are also spectacular . Dirty War is a must see ! ! !",1

As it turn out Adam doe n't have both oar in the water which , almost immediately , cause untold stress and turmoil for Dr. Norwell . This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another , all centered around Adam 's inability and seizure . Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child wa never explained . Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one wa dishing out . Personally , I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack .

"This is the Who at their most powerful . Although before the masterwork Who 's Next , which would provide anthem like Baba O'reily and Wont Get Fooled Again . This film show the group in transition from mod rocker to one of the biggest live band of the 70 's . Daltrey show what being a front-man is all about , Entwistle steady a ever . Moon is great , check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech , and see him playing `` side saddle '' whilst having a bass drum head replaced ! Townsend even look like he 's enjoying himself occasionally ! Considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd wa asleep !

"This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell -- and did so . Really awful jumble of unlikely/unexplained coincidence and unidentifiable plot line , all without character or clear motivation . We get cliché snapshot instead of character . One in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime bos , who project an overdone `` tough guy '' persona and cast a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guy who have been brought in to work for her . Nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boy hit the road and one of them carry a tiny suitcase ( a in , the smallest from a complete American Tourister set ) in a bright , sky blue , without explanation or apology . Otherwise it 's standard visually -- one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in CT .",0
"They filmed this movie out on long Island , where I grew up . My brother and his girlfriend were extra in this movie . Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer , ( which they told me wa colored water , tasted disgusting , and wa very hard to keep swallowing over and over again , especially in the funnel scene ) . Yet none of u ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form . It never came out in the theater ( obviously ) and it , a far a I knew , wa never released on video , and I 'm sure wa n't released on DVD . Yet it look like it wa seen by some people , albeit it probably very few . So there must be something . I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother , yet there is no way I can find it anywhere . Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased ? And which format that would be ?",1
"That 's how Burt Reynolds describes this film , which happens to be his best ever . He play Tom Sharky , a vice detective who 's on the trail of an international mobster ( Vittorio Gassman ) and the man he 's financing to be the next governor of Georgia ( Earl Holliman ) . In the novel by William Diehl , the story is more complex because the guy 's running for president . This is a very long movie that feel more like three hour instead of two . The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel set the mood just right for the story . Reynolds doe n't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy film . He 's very serious here , especially in the beginning of the movie because he get demoted for a dope bust that go wrong . At time though , the movie play more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt trying to get close to the mobster 's woman . Only towards the end of the film doe the violence get cranked up that lead to the bang bang climax . Just like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin , Sharky 's Machine feature an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest star including Chet Baker , Julie London , Flora Purim & Buddy De Franco , The Manhattan Transfer , Doc Severinson , Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams . Al Capps handle the score with magic . This movie ha become one of the best crime drama ever . Check it out . Score , 8 out of 10 Stars",1
"Human Traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friend , it is a fly-on-the-wall view into their life ( and mind ) which will show you how this group of friend relate to each other . There are many moment in that every one can relate to , Like being out of you skull at party and talking complete rubbish to stranger . The character are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the role that they play in the movie . The situation that they are in are all situation that we all have found ourselves in , and that is where this film succeeds . The topic of sex and drug are handled superbly a to no get in the way of the character relationship with each other . The story to the film is not all that , but that is not a criticism . This is a film about people . This is a well written film , with a sound track to die for . D.J 's Pete Tong ha put together an superb selection of track for this file which all go to make this one of the best film that I have seen in 1999 . After watching this film I felt like I had been out partying all weekend . Fantastic Movie ! Jo Brand a the voice of reality - Need I say more !",1
"This early Biograph short wa so much fun to watch . The second on disc one of D.W. Griffith 's `` Years of Discovery '' DVD set ( highly recommended ) it feature three excellent performance by the main lead , and interesting to see Henry B. Walthall ( The Little Colonel , Birth of a Nation ) a a campy musician giving a Countess the eye ( and other thing ) . The Countess ' husband go berserk at his wife 's betrayal and ha her walled into a little room with her paramour . It 's kind of incredible that they would n't hear the wall going up , but hey , maybe the wine had something to do with it . Here Mr. Johnson ( father of silent player Raymond Hackett ) gesticulates wildly and this add to the melodrama , but in an unexpectedly comical way . The best moment come at the end . As the lady pass out from shock and fear , once she realizes she 's doomed , Henry pick up his instrument and `` fan '' it over her . The way he did it wa so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy , and I just lost it , and laughed my head off . The expression on his face ! From that moment I wa charmed by Henry B.

"Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life . This is the movie which caused his downfall . It wa released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial loss for it producer and distributor . Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the loss incurred . Soon after it release , he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably . Its a very bad movie with horrible acting , bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay . Throughout the movie , Rajinikanth look like a person suffering from some disease . I 'm one of the unfortunate soul who saw Baba , first day first show in theatre . The audience were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission . Sorry , I 'll not recommend this one to anyone .",0
"Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma , SCARFACE paint a picture not easily forgotten . Al Pacino turn in a stunning performance a Tony Montana , a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world a he ruthlessly run his self made kingdom of crime in Florida . This gangster flick is harsh , violent , loud , gross , unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word `` f -- k '' the most number of time . Almost three hour long , and yes it can get repulsive . A stout hearted constitution keep you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord . Also playing interesting character are Michelle Pfeiffer , Steven Bauer , Robert Loggia , Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio , F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar . Pacino prof to be one of the greatest of his generation . He manages to bring reality to his character that leaf a strong impression . This will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster . Is that powerful enough for you ? Crime doe not pay for long !",1
"First , the CGI in this movie wa horrible . I watched it during a marathon of bad movie on the SciFi channel . At the end when the owner of the park get killed , it 's probably one of the worst example of CGI I have even seen . Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation . That said , the movie had almost no plot . Why were they on that island in particular ? Well , it wa n't stated in the movie . And , why would the people keep coming into the cat 's area ? Makes no sense . One thing that stood out in this movie wa moderately good acting . In what could be called a `` B made for TV movie '' movie , the acting wa very good . Parry Shen stood out in particular . If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday , watch this movie . It may be good for some memorable quote .",0
"I enjoyed it . There you go , I said it again . I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more time . Call me old fashioned but I prefer movie like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America . Van Damme move well for a guy of his age ( 47 I think ) , delivering kick that reminds one of Kickboxer . If you like old school action and and explosion , this is the movie to watch . This is one of Van Damme 's best work . Van Damme and Steven Seagal movie get released theatrically where I live so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action star on the big screen .",1
"What a waste of talent . A very poor , semi-coherent , script cripple this film . Rather unimaginative direction , too . Some VERY faint echo of _Fargo_ here , but it just doe n't come off .",0
"Although it stray away from the book a little , you ca n't help but love the atmospheric music and setting . The scene in Bath are just how they should be . Although if you have watched it a many time a I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene , but that aside , I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths , but did the men and woman really bathe together like that ? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the woman . It also seemed strange that they all had their hat on , but perhaps this wa the style at the time . The ballroom scene were very nice , the dancing and the outfit looked beautiful . I especially liked Catherine 's dress in the first ballroom scene . Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing , but I enjoyed the Bath scene better . Schlesinger give a good but not exceptional performance a Catherine Morland . Googie Withers give the best performance a Mrs Allen I feel . Ugh Peter Firth a Mr Tilney , he just talk a load of rubbish , and is not a clergyman a he should be , it 's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine , but then the book never really gave that impression either . General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy , and Stuart also give a sort of good performance a Isabella . Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance a Elinor Tilney . As for John Thorpe , well he give the impression of a seedy and lustful man , perhaps not the character portrayed in the book , but I quite like it . I can handle scene being cut from a book adaptation , but when new scene and character are added it usually annoys me . The marchioness ! I hate her . She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy . some of the script is peculiar . When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks `` I suppose you saw the body ? How did it appear ? '' What a silly thing to say ! Elinor 's calm response is stupid too . anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me",1

"A lovely little film about the introduction of motion picture to China . Captures the amazement of film 's first audience pretty much a it 's described to have been worldwide , and us actual Lumiere film for most of the actuality . I do n't agree with other people about bad acting on the British fellow 's part - I thought he wa fine , but the Chinese lead really stole the show . In any case , I found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie . People who fear subtitle might note that a lot of the film is in English ( which for some reason is given subtitle a well a the Chinese on the DVD ) .",1
"Sigh . I 'm baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignment and whatnot . I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards . It wa mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration , the set design seen many time before , the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style , and the story that go nowhere . And we got the `` joke '' about shooting the crow with the 45 the first time , alright ? But I guess what 's really unacceptable is that it even swipe it basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE , THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge ! As any quick internet search will reveal . I mean , what is this ? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and open door in Canada for a filmmaker ? `` Give your head a shake '' a Don Cherry might say .",0
"Cute idea ... salesgirl Linda Smith ( Yolande Donlan ) inherits a teeny tiny little county of Lampidorra . That country , which wa n't even in North America , wa made the 49th state ... ( of course , there were only 48 state at the time , since this wa made in 1952 ... ) Linda travel to the country she ha inherited , and we follow her along a she try to figure out what to do with this strange country and it even quirkier people . At one point , she sings a song that she claim is from her people the Navajo , and it get ever-more sillier from there .... although Yolande Donlan 's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared . There are other song scattered through-out a the citizen sing to welcome their new princess . Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor , or some such equivalent , about the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde a British subject Tony Craig , cheese vendor .

Craig and `` the new princess '' keep bumping into each other , and their adventure become more intertwined a Lampidorra 's financial problem worsen ...

"Back in 1982 a little film called MAKING LOVE shocked audience with it frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men . I have been waiting for year for a good , old-fashioned romance between two men ; LATTER DAYS is all that and more . Yes , it is soapy , melodramatic , cliché-ridden , and quite corny . That is what make it so wonderful . There is nothing like a good romantic movie , and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word . As to the issue of religion , sorry folk , but these thing do happen and are happening to gay people even now . It is not just the Mormon church that reject it gay member . Gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection . I loved this movie . It ha a perfect blend of a fantasy-romance grounded in the reality of the day-to-day life of the character . If I could give it more than ten star I would . Good love story never go out of style ; great love story like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable . It 's about time !",1
"The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweeper work out surprisingly hilarious . It guarantee some funny situation and silly antic , from especially Stan Laurel of course a usual . The movie also ha a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula . It doe n't really sound like a logical mix of story line and incoherent but both plot line blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending . It 's still a bit weird but it funny nevertheless , so it work for the movie . The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good . Sam Adams is great a the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield go deliciously over-the-top a the nutty professor . The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequence , which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed . It all help to make `` Dirty Work '' to be one of the better Laurel & Hardy short . 8/10",1
"This movie came a a huge disappointment . The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain , but I expected Shamballa to tie up all the loose end . Unfortunately , it did n't . It added more plot hole than it resolved , and confused more than it clarified . The animation and voice acting were great , but with an idiotic plot , dull setting ( most of the movie doe n't even take place in dull WWII Earth rather than the Alchemy world ) , and disappointing ending ( Ed is useless for the rest of his day in a world with no alchemy , and he ditch Winry ? ) , it wa altogether pretty lackluster . Do yourself a favor -- disregard the last half of the anime a well a this movie , and read the manga .",0
"Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I 've been feeling down in the dump and it 's such a lovely little fairytale . Whatever the reason , I thought it wa pitch perfect . Great , intelligent story , beautiful effect , excellent acting ( especially De Niro , who is awesome ) . This movie made me happier than I 've been for a while . It is a very funny and clever movie . The running joke of the kingdom 's history of prince savagery and the aftermath , the way indulging in magic effect the witch and dozen of smart little touch all kept me enthralled . That 's much of what make it so good ; it 's an elaborate , special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movie , yet there is an incredible attention to small thing . I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again .",1
"I wa surprised that `` Forgiving the Franklins `` did not generate more buzz at this year Sundance Film Festival . There were time that the laughter at the screening I saw wa so loud that you could barely hear the movie . The movie ha some excellent acting and a story that really make one examine broader issue . You know little issue like Religion , sex and the truth . Lots of comedy 's seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situation , many leave you thinking `` I know they ripped this off from some sitcom `` .This film take off on it own unique direction . I really think that Jay Floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film .",1
"They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmaker arriving at the Hollywood bus station . They then fill in the blank and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived . You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot , four young boy playing in grainy slow motion , accompanied by voice over narration . Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boy playing in grainy slow motion . Once they 're grown , it 's easy to spot the writer/director among the four . He 's the quiet , contemplative , long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pant . This mean that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood . Only there 's no writing , or directing talent on display here . And if you still ca n't figure out which one he is , here 's a hint : The auteur and his character have the same middle name . It took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school . What looked like a prison wa apparently a high school , the warden turned out to be the principal . Once more , the poor , misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement , murder and pillage , but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father . How about hitting back , kid , like you do everyone else ? Numerous fist fight scene for no apparent purpose . Howlingly bad dialogue . Many scene badly out of focus . Cartoon character keep popping up a bit player and extra , drawing unintentional laugh from the premiere audience . Overacting in the extreme . And if you do n't quite get the self-important speech , or the slow-motion scene , just listen to the overbearing music . It will clue you in and what you 're supposed to feel . Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lot of frequent flier mileage a she travel around the country working in these amateur regional film . The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kid who gun down old lady , run over puppy chained to a tree , rob and steal , all the while complaining about their sad , sorry life . But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college . Yeah , that 's the ticket . Why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker belief that his life so far is so important , so interesting , that the world ca n't wait to see it onscreen ? If this movie is a autobiographical a it seems , then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policeman bearing fugitive warrant .",0
"I watched this movie so that you do n't have to ! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson , but what wa he thinking ? He did this for scale ? At least the film 's title practice truth in advertising , since people and object routinely disappear throughout the film , adding to the confusion . Kristofferson mention this in his commentary that even he wa n't sure if Genevieve Bujold 's character really existed . This doe not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story ! The `` making of '' feature wa far more interesting than the movie itself . It explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie , even a the film is being shot . To it 's credit , this movie is visually pleasing and doe n't in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1M . Too bad the money wa n't spent on a better project .",0
"Just saw this movie on opening night . I read some other user comment which convinced me to go see it ... I must say , I wa not impressed . I 'm so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money . First of all `` The Messengers '' is very predictable , and just not much of a thriller . It might be scary for someone under 13 , but it really did nothing for me . The climax wa laughable and most of the audience left before the movie 's resolution . Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial . Some of the emotional argument between the family were le convincing than the sub-par suspense scene . If you 've seen preview for this movie , then you 've seen most of the best part and have a strong understanding of the plot . This movie is not worth seeing in the theater .",0
"I went to see this movie ( actually I went to see Family Portraits , which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short film by Douglas Buck ) at the Mar del Plata festival ( Argentina ) ... I just could n't watch it ! I had to cover my eye after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while . By the time it wa over , my stomach wa upside down and I felt light headed . I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minute after the 2nd short begun ( BTW , of course I wa not the only one who left the room ) . It wa WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me ! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it . I just do n't get how you can love that kind of movie ! The shocking and bloody and horrible image I saw got really stuck in my head for like two day ! ! I also try to analyze the story ( my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it ) and I just do n't think it make any sense . I mean , that amount of violence and stuff , make no other sense than to try to shock people . And that 's not a good enough reason , I think . There 's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say `` Well , at least ' x ' thing about it wa good '' . But well , I guess I will never understand that kind of film .",0
"A well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending . Pluses : The way the story move - begin with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he 's there . The Music . A disinterested look at the life of policeman . Minuses : The violence and the gore , but I guess they add to the realistic effect . Still , having people 's head chopped off and sent in box and sack could have been avoided . No complaint - 7/10",1
"I do n't understand the positive comment made about this film . It is cheap and nasty on all level and I can not understand how it ever got made . Cartoon character abound - Sue 's foul-mouthed , alcoholic , layabout , Irish father being a prime example . None of the character are remotely sympathetic - except , briefly , for Sue 's Asian boyfriend but even he then turn out to be capable of domestic violence ! As desperately unattractive a they both are , I 've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do , why should I be expected to care what happens to them ? So many review keep carping on about how `` realistic '' it is . If that is true , it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film . I did n't like the film at all .",0
Steven what have you done you have hit an all new low . It is weird since Steven 's last film shadow man wa directed by the same director who did this trash . Shadow man wa good this wa diabolically bad so bad it wa n't even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and feel like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway . As for the action well let 's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it doe finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scene . Seagal hardly kill anyone unlike his over film where he go one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wound . the plot is so confusing with so many plot hole that it doe n't make scene sometimes . flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pound on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time,0
"A call-girl witness a murder and becomes the killer 's next target . Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here : his camera swoop around corner in a museum ( after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape ) , divvy up into split screen for arty purpose , practically give away his plot with a sequence ( again in split screen ) where two character are both watching a TV program about transsexual , and stage his ( first ) finale during a thunderous rainstorm . `` Dressed To Kill '' is exhausting , primarily because it asks u to swallow so much and give back nothing substantial . Much of the acting ( with the exception of young Keith Gordon ) is mediocre and the ( second ) finale is a rip-off of De Palma 's own `` Carrie '' -- not to mention `` Psycho '' . The explanation of the dirty deed play like a spoof of Hitchcock , not an homage . Stylish in a steely cold way , the end result are distinctly half-baked . * * from * * * *",0
"* Flat SPOILERS * Five med student , Nelson ( Kiefer Sutherland ) , David Labraccio ( Kevin Bacon ) , Rachel Mannus ( Julia Roberts ) , Joe Hurley ( William Baldwin ) & Randy Steckle ( Oliver Platt ) decide to attempt an experiment ; dying for exactly 5 minute ( it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage ) . Almost everyone doe this experiment , Randy being the lone exception , but they begin to have unwelcome visitor ; David see a little black girl shouting crude insult to him , Joe see all the woman he ha had sex with ( and which he videotaped ) asking him why from the TV Screen , Rachel relives her father 's suicide and Nelson face a little boy with murderous intention . Why are they here ? And how will they get rid of them ? This tense and interesting movie , set in an hallucinated city and into a Gothic Med School , is quite the experience , both for the story and the character , played by then-budding star such a Kiefer Sutherland , Julia Roberts , Oliver Platt , Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin . The director is Joel Schumacher , who had already worked with Sutherland in 'Lost Boys ' , and this second cooperation is even better than the first . A must for psychological-thriller-horror bud and metaphor lover ( this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrong ) , this is one of the minor classic from the '80s that get respect even today , like the mention by Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2 ' or the Tru Calling episode which used the movie 's premise .

"One of my favorite show back in the '70s . As I recall it went to air on Friday ( or possibly Saturday ) night on the Nine Network ( ? ) here in Australia . Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together . Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent . To their credit , the writer made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampire and ghost a much a possible . I remember one episode in which the adversary wa the spirit of an ancient Indian Chief which/who 'came back ' a a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital . The final showdown saw Kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast ' amidst an explosion of spark and billowing flame . Oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it wa an interesting idea . McGavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his role and this wa one of his best . Definitely deserves a place in TV 's `` Hall of Fame '' . To quote Tony Vincenzo .... 'Kolchack you are ON IT ' ... Or , in the case of the Hall of Fame , 'IN it ' !",1
"I think my summary say it all . This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show feature a Gen X ( or is that Gen Y ) type putting in false chopper and wearing various hat and wig and glass , and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situation . Example : Kennedy ha a guy invite his parent to his `` wedding . '' Kennedy is the bride , done up in a full bridal gown and long wig . The `` joke '' is that the parent immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claim to no longer have his `` bit and piece . '' Problem is , this schtick go on way too long , obviously to fill out time . And Kennedy is about a funny a a dead cod lying in the sun . Candid Camera would have run three or four scenario in the time it took Kennedy to get through this one , running around , constantly asking `` Do I look fat ? '' I recognize the show wa not made for me . It wa made for 12-year-old pinhead who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today . So let them laugh . Thank God the show wa short-lived .",0
"Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situation where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time ; and just at the moment you realize you should n't be laughing , you 've already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness ; and a you look around you at the ghostly white face with their gaping wide-open mouth and glazen eye , you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and ... well , you get the point . But for all it unpleasantness and punch in the face , Frownland , really is a remarkable piece of work that , after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic trouble and mishap , make you want to scratch your own eye out and at the same time , you feel sickenly sorry for him . It would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronstein 's film , but for some insane reason , I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film ha to offer . If someone set you on fire , you typically want to put it out : Stop ! Drop ! And Roll ! But with this film , you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body . You endure the pain -- perhaps out of spite , or some unknown masochistic curiosity I ca n't even begin to attempt to explain . Unfortunately , mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you . But if you get a chance to catch it , prepare yourself : bring a doggie bag .",1
"I saw this movie while surfing through infomercial and late-night 80 's sitcom on tv one night at 2 in the morning . I must say , I did n't expect much , and I did n't get much . Although Rose McGowan is hot , her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast wa not Oscar-worthy , to say the least . This movie ha it ups and down , and doe have a nice couple of twist at the end , but in all honesty it wa awful . Not even a typical slasher movie . No gore , no sex , no nudity , no real violence . Just bad acting . I 'd give it a 3 out of 10 .",0
"I first saw this film when I wa about 8 year old on TV in the UK ( where it wa called `` Laupta : The Flying Island '' ) . I absolutely loved it , and wa heartbroken when it wa repeated a while later and I missed it . I wa enchanted by the story and character , but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music . It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to a the `` Streamline Dub '' ( the dub wa actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline ) which is sadly unavailable except a part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set . Unfortunately I feel that the release ha been partly spoiled by Disney . The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doe n't have the same raw energy that the `` streamline '' dub or the original Japanese had , and I think James Van Der Beek sound too old to play the lead . They have made some pointless alteration , such a changing the main character 's name from `` Pazu '' to `` Patzu '' , and added some dialogue . But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scene with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airship for example wa originally silent but ha been spoiled thanks to Disney 's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking , which I find annoying in many Disney film . This film still blow away most recent animated film , and I can not recommend it highly enough . The plot is simple yet captivating and the film show a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market , homogenized animation .",1
"This film ca n't make up it mind whether it message is `` human are evil and bad and animal are sweet and blameless '' or `` do n't ever go in the water again . '' A fisherman ( Nolan ) is out to nab a killer whale , a very bad thing , but when he accidentally ( ACCIDENTALLY mark you ) hit a pregnant cow instead of her mate , the cow -- and I use the word in all sens -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throw herself against the propeller trying to chew herself to bit in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself . ( I doubt it wa her first . ) When her unborn fetus abort from her hideous self-inflicted wound , her mate go mental with revenge and swears to hurt , kill and mutilate every human who even so much a talk to Nolan . Obviously a among human , total psycho date other total psycho . The film reek of half-thought out anti-human message , `` the poor poor whale ! ! the evil men must suffer and die ! '' and yet , it doe not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all . It 's true that when he set out his motif were selfish and cruel , but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and , a the film progress , he grows more and more compassionate to the whale 's pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale , just to make it feel a little better . The film final journey , in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north , reminds me of Melville 's eerie man-whale connection , and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion , where these two husband might connect , understand even respect each other in their own grief , for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident . It 's clear Nolan respect the whale and feel for it loss . However , it never go there . The whale-character ha no compassion or respect for anyone . The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws-like where the sea-monster finally kill everybody and Nolan and no-doubt through an oversight , fails to chomp up the whale-hugger ( tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier . ) I love animal , and I detest whaling , and what is more I love orca whale , but if this film 's goal wa to make me feel that the whale wa the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed . Nolan show compassion and growth , and feel for others , and all the whale think about is killing and maiming . The only message one can walk away with is `` If you see an orca whale , ever , anywhere , run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way , he will hunt you to the end of the earth destroying everything around you .

"Why , o ' WHY ! ... did I pick this one up ? Well ... i needed a no-brainer in the summer heat , and the cover looked cool . Of course I should 've known better . This is a really , really bad movie . And it get embarasing when the maker know it 's bad , and try cover it up by adding some sexy/beautiful woman , and some sex-scenes to it . Well , folk ... it does'nt cut it , doe it ! If you WOULD like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very , very good , well-played and funny : go rent Lake Placid !

"Only a very small child could overlook the absurdity in this bomb ; the first difficulty faced by the submarine `` Seaview '' is what appear to be chunk of -- rock ? falling down through the water and crashing into it hull . But it 's not rock , they 're under the North Pole -- it is ICE ! Everybody , except possibly hitherto mentioned small child ( and even some of them ) know that ICE FLOATS . Then , disaster strike -- that darn VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around the Earth catch fire ! No one know how this happened , we are told , which is understandable , because it is utterly impossible for radiation to `` catch fire '' , and even if it could , there is NO AIR IN SPACE for it to burn . There is literally no good reason to overlook science concept basic to 2nd grade school textbook when making a film ; however , Irwin Allen manages to do it again and again ; perhaps we are meant to focus on the `` people '' instead , which is pretty easy , a they are CARDBOARD . The cast try very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub-kiddie romp , much like later episode of his `` Lost in Space '' TV series , the concept of which wa swiped outright from writer Ib Melchior and then rushed into production . The sub look pretty good , though , which is why this one get a `` 2 '' .",0
"Our teacher showed u this movie in first grade . I have n't seen it since . I just watched the trailer though . Does this look like a first grade movie to you ? I do n't think so . I wa so horrified by this movie , I could barely watch it . It wa mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half , and then there wa the boy with ketchup ! I wa freaked out by this film . Now today , being 20 , I probably would not feel that way . I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small child should n't see this movie , even though it 's PG . Be aware of the possible outcome of showing this to kid .

"A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable difference in opinion constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon 's seed . The horror wa left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific , but , instead demonstrated an ill dose of belief which ridiculed each other to death , despite the title itself . Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning , this ridiculous plot twist with it 's sordid depiction crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon . I view this episode a being thrown together from the get go , never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what it worth and relieved when it finally came to `` The End '' ..",0
"Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem . That is the first , most important , and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re-imagining Scooby-Doo and company . Shaggy 's voice is squeaky and doe not sound anything like he ha ever sounded in any of the previous incarnation of the Scooby show . They 've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original . I 'm not sure what they 're on about yet with the villain angle , but it surely is n't following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby show . And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted . I like it , but it 's not real Scooby-Doo type animation . But the weird animation used for other WB show grew on me ; this might , too . It 's worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice . That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly . Besides , I am trying not to be an inflexible , nitpicking fan . Evolve or die , a the saying go . We 'll see how it look after two more episode -- by then I 'll have formed a much more solid opinion .",0

The script wa non existent with inane dialog such a `` Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai , wahee fashion hota hai '' and `` Yeh Versace hai Madam '' ( yeah right ) . Every one of the character wa shallow and underdeveloped . Acting wa awful . Constumes ( lycra for Udita and awful suit for a stocky Emran ) , locale ( the numerous house that were used for interior did not even vaguely resemble a Victorian mansion ) , screenplay etc etc , just one word- rubbish . For those people who love Hashmi and his movie , watch it . As for me , I 'll never get those two and a half hour back . The only redeeming factor wa some of the music which wa decent .",0
This movie is an amazing comedy .. the script is too funny .. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more . Though the comedy at time is silly but it really make u laugh ! ! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their role . After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which wa a funny a this .,1
"Even this early in his career , Capra wa quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing . This is a thin story -- and quite predictable at time -- but he get very good performance out of his cast and ha some rather intricate camera move that involve the viewer intimately . The first part look like a Cinderella story , though anyone with brain can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich 'prince ' will lose his fortune . Nonetheless , because of his good cast and fast pace , it 's easy to get caught up in the clichés . Then the movie doe become more original , a the married couple have to find a way to make a living . The ending is very predictable but satisfying . I also want to compliment the title-writing : very witty and fun .",1
"Uwe Boll slip back in his film-making skill once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenary and reporter taking on super soldier on a remote island . An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who make the worst of script that should have worked . The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter ha been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked , additionally the effect and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eye have some degree of creepiness , however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way . Its a if he could n't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placement and walked away . Additionally the assembly of scene ha no spark or life , I 'm guessing that Boll only shot one or two take and just used what he had . It really stink . Clearly Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde film where anything he 's ever learned about film get flushed . The last film he made that wa this bad wa Seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst film I 've ever seen . This is n't that bad , but it is close simply because it should have been better . Then again Udo Keir is good enough that he doe make watching his scene worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad it good film . I 'd take a pas unless it 's late at night and you 're catching it on cable .",0
"This video is so hilariously funny , it make everything else by Eddie Murphy seem very disappointing ( even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor , which just go to show you how good this really is ) . To be honest , I do n't think that I 've ever laughed at something a much a this , including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse . This show is amazing , although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with F that is four letter long ( plus it extended version beginning with M ) but it did n't bother me . See it , the funniest thing I 've ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too .",1
"This film is dreadful . It ha absolutely zero laugh . Hebrew Hammer ( Adam Goldberg ) set out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa ( Andy Dick ) . Perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot , in actual fact the film doe not progress beyond this premise . While there are some ( far and few ) nice touch and the plot is relatively coherent , it is laboured , hackneyed and ultimately , mindlessly boring . This despite the fact that Goldberg , Dick and Greer ( Hammer 's client/love interest ) all have quite considerable screen presence . Despite being played for what might be described a whacky over-the-top gag , this film is consistently middle-class middle-of-the-road muck . DO NOT waste 85 minute of your life on this . ( note- the music wa good .. ! )",0
"It 's amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place . The character are so weak , and the acting so uninspired , that it 's impossible to care about any of them -- especially Brooke Shields . The temptation to fast forward through the slow part is almost irresistible . If you like this genre , you 'd be better off renting `` Singles , '' or `` Bodies , Rest & Motion . ''",0
"I never watched the 'Next Action Hero ' show , and until reading the other comment here , did not know that this movie wa the 'prize ' from that competition . I wa just flipping channel and came across this , and found myself watching , dare eagerly , all the way to the end . Yes , the plot 's been done ( The Most Dangerous Game , etc . ) but I wa hoping for , and almost received , the 'gotcha ' - how the protagonist wa going to beat the hunter in the end . I think the high-tech wa overdone ( GPS 's ) and gave me cold-sweat flashback of Night Rider , but it nevertheless wa not too overdone . The basic problem I had with this movie wa the degree of SOD ( Suspension of Disbelief ) that wa required of the viewer . Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenade at a public bridge and NO COPS show up to investigate ? Could a limousine do countless donut in a Las Vegas intersection and NO COPS show up ? Pleeease . Way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch , but keep it at least plausible , thank you very much . The final solution wa good , but the ending wa disappointing , with the after taste of a bad Star Trek episode . At least now I understand why the acting wa so cheesy - except for Zane , who doe n't get near a much work a he deserves IMHO - they were winner from a reality show . Knock me out .",1
"I am a big fan of old horror movie , and since I am middle aged , old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920 's to 1960 's period . I am not a big fan of more modern horror movie , with one exception being Creepshow 1 , which I thought wa great . I could reminisce about the story there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook , and also the one about the really clean guy wa a great ending . All the story were great though . So why did I like them so much ? The character had some decent development , the line were very plain about who wa good and who wa bad , the horror bit were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear , and the funny bit were really funny ! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these element or they are totally absent ! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie wa a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other thing like write movie review on IMDb.com , lol . When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it 's telling you something ..... 4 of 10 . Also , Romero 's expertise is hard to find here , they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard ( I do n't know what this wa rated at but it look PG to me ) , and that 's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on . It 's shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing ( yuck yuck ) to see it .",0
"I just wanted to say that . I love Gheorghe Muresan , so I automatically loved this movie . Everything else about it wa so-so ... Billy Crystal is a good actor , even if he is annoying . But the thing that made this movie was- at least , for a basketball fan- seeing Gheorghe Muresan act .",1
"I thought that this movie wa incredible . I absolutely loved it , even though my brother did n't that much . The special effect were outstanding , and this movie is about my favorite sport ; golf . The only thing that wa disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two time or more in a row . This movie just absolutely top everything else I have ever seen . It wa everything I would expect out of a movie . I just loved it . Also , it wa pretty kid-friendly . This movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it , anything is possible . I would give it a pure 10/10 ! It wa better than The Legend of Baggar Vants , and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movie combined . Absolutely amazing . Loved it .",1
"This is a funny film and I like it a lot . Cary Elwes play Robin Hood to a tee . This is , of course , the usual good v evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham .

"Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made . Well , they are only partly right . For me , this IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD ! I have never seen anything so basely crude , and insulting , and vile , and against human nature a this film . A true embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry , this is n't even so Bad , it good . There is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of Elvis ' other bad movie like Clambake . This one is so rotten to sit through it painful . Pure Garbage . Native Americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here .

"First of all yes I 'm white , so I try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race ... anyway ... White People Hating Black people = BAD but Black People Hating White people = OK ( because apparently we deserved it ! ! ) . where do i start ? i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scene : the infamous scene were Ice Cube and co. get in a fight with some really big , really strong , really really angry and scary looking Neo-Nazis and win ! ! ! the neo-Nazi where twice the size : ) , and the chase ! the chase is priceless ... This is NOT a movie about race , tolerance and understanding , it doe n't deliver ... this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the cliché stereotype , the white wimpy guy who get manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead ... cmon simply awful I do regret ever seeing it . Save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written , poorly acted , dull and clearly biased picture , if you are into the subject , go and Rent American History X , now thats a movie",0
"Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in one horror film ; that always sound like a terrific plan . Two of the most versatile cult actor of their generation , who previously already starred together in terrific genre outing like `` The Flesh and the Fiends '' and `` From Beyond the Grave '' , pairing up in a mid-70 's satanic themed exploitation flick . How can this possibly go wrong ? Well , unfortunately , it can . To my deepest regret `` Land of the Minotaur '' can hardly even be called mediocre , and that in spite of the cast , the exotic setting , the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise . In a remote little area in Greece , more particularly near an archaeological site , multiple tourist vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile follower keep feeding them to a fire-breathing Minotaur statue . Cushing , who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before , owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this mean you also own the complementary archaeological ruin and an underground network of cavern . That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random camper and amateur archaeologist . When three of his young friend also mysteriously disappear in the same area , Father Roch - the priest of a couple of town before ) - decides to investigate . `` Land of the Minotaur '' is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempt to generate a satanic atmosphere and doe n't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating element and pagan trivia detail . The titular Minotaur , for example , is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person , but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance . Instead , the film focus on tedious and overly talkative sequence and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noise . The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance . His portrayal of rude , bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable a always .",0
"The three short included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless Chaplin classic , nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either . Chaplin 's score for these film and the framework added a bridging section between the short are also well done . The problem with this compilation is a minor one , yet annoying . The short have been stretch-printed to fit the 24 frame p.s . speed of contemporary film whereas the short themselves where shot at 20 frame p.s . This result is jerky motion that doe n't look very attractive , and yet this wa an excusable solution given the limitation of optical printing technology at the time , it 's just not excusable that the current DVD version is unrestored , the film look dirty a they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed . There are separate restored version of these classic available , even on DVD , and it would not be a problem to restore the image , but ala this ha not been done . A minor quibble ha taken up a lot of space in my article , but I say again a minor quibble , it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating . The short are still worth '10 ' .",1
"1979 's Tourist Trap is a clever , unique B thriller that stand out a one of the best of it 's kind . Travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner 's mannequin are a little too life-like for comfort . While the film ha hint of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Tourist Trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of The Twilight Zone . Director David Schmoeller give this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery , that reach nightmarish proportion . Also , Schmoelloer add the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happening . Venteran actor Chuck Connors is the best of the film 's decent cast . Pino Donaggio 's music score is excellent , having both lyrical and solemn theme that are perfect to the movie . A number of the film 's sequence are quite memorable . For horror and thriller fan alike , Tourist Trap is an unforgettable must-see film . * * * 1/2 out of * * * *",1
"Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me , the atmosphere of the movie wa first class , the acting memorable and the storyline a classic . Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2 ...... I wa so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here wa a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie , again everything wa just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG ! , I wish I 'd stopped at II . The storyline wa not good , it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story , the character were weak especially the daughter . Pacino 's protege wa a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2 . Then scene such a , Corleone being invested with all the trapping of the Catholic Church with full choir , the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset , the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting ( where the 'goodies ' get away and everyone else is shot ) , daughter and 1st cousin rolling bit of pasta across a board , the pathetic shooting on the step ..... Corleone stuffing sweet down him with orange juice for diabetes ( a man of his intelligence and guile is n't ready for an emergency ? ) ... NO it wa not good and with the best will in the world I wont be able to watch it again . But I 'll watch 1 & 2 many time down the year .",0
"This little two-person movie is actually much bigger than it look . It ha so many layer . I 've watched it over and over , and always pick up on something new .

"UK newspaper review seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewer tend to know Toby Young , the journalist on whose real-life experience this movie is based . The key word here is `` based '' . How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom . Sidney Young join a prestigious gossip magazine in New York , where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally Getting It Right and Making It . This involves him selling out , and the movie ha some serious point to make about journalistic integrity . However , they are not overdone : the main substance remains a comedy which centre around Sidney 's misadventure . The script ha it cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid , well-meaning buffoon at the same time a being a smart , moderately obnoxious skilled writer . This contradiction is never that much of an issue , because Simon Pegg ( a Sidney ) project likability too well . Jeff Bridges underplays Sidney 's editor a little too effectively , and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous a the conflicted eventual object of Sidney 's affection And , with regard to Megan Fox ( who play an airhead bimbo starlet ) , I can say only this : just say the word , Miss Fox , and I will leave my wife , sell all my belonging , and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side a your consort . Of course , given that I 'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant , you might not find my offer too enticing , but it 's there on the table anyway . Given how short her career ha been so far , one might think it is a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoon the sort of actress she might be thought to become : however , she doe it sweetly , with some skill , and extremely sexily . This girl will go far . There is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performer - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK , Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the US . There are several laugh-out-loud moment , and I smiled most of the way through . As ever , the F-word make appearance when it really doe n't need to , although at least a couple of these are very funny .",1
"Alien Hunter : 5 out of 10 : Is it me or doe every movie that start in Roswell , New Mexico suck . Take Alien mixed with The Thing , mixed with Contact , mixed with of all thing On the Beach , The Andromeda Strain , the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot . Derivative doe n't even begin to describe this movie . Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right ? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease . ( James Spader causally mention he need a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him . he turn her down . AGGH ! ) In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven thing up this is it . I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking woman in white bathing suit wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke . With about 30 second of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure . Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and ha virtually no screen time for someone who share half the title . I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif . ( Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame , Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenager why not the cornfield ? ) The character in the cornfield dress like Logan 's Run extra and I wa just waiting for the stalk to come alive and attack them . That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movie covenant . The acting is mostly fine a Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear . John Lynch however read the whole script and act the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it . Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that make me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie .",0
"I have a hard time putting into word just how wonderful this wa . Once in a while you see a film that just stick with you . `` You Are Alone '' is that movie ( for me ) . The film is constantly in my head and in my heart . I replay the scene mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotion all over again , a if I am seeing it for the first time . There is nothing I did not like about the movie . Amazing soundtrack ! ! ! The ending wa perfect . Very emotionally stirring ! ! ! It wa compelling and riveting . I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance wa the greatest I have ever witnessed . I admired Brittany 's strength ( what a strong woman ) . The tag line is `` When your darkest moment come to life '' . We never know what we are capable of doing . Everyone say oh I would never do that , when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation . We are very capable of anything and this movie delf straight into that subject . The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part . Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art ! ! ! !",1

The special effect are awesome , especially Linnea 's scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed . Plenty of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill , plenty of humor , cool soundtrack , high body count , etc ...

"Lorna Green ( Janine Reynaud ) is a performance artist for wealthy intellectual at a local club . She fall prey to her fantasy a the promise of romantic interlude turn into murder a she kill those who believe that sex is on the horizon . It 's quite possible that , through a form of hypnotic suggestion , someone ( .. a possible task master pulling her string like a puppet ) is guiding Lorna into killing those she come across in secluded place just when it appears that love-making is about to begin . After the murder within her fantasy are committed , Lorna awakens bewildered , often clueless a to if what she wa privy to within her dream ever took place in reality . If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco , I 'd say it 's elegant & difficult . By now , you 've probably read other user comment befuddled by what this film is about , since a large portion of it take place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream . Franco mentioned in an interview that he wa heavily influenced by Godard early in his career , a far a film-making style , and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience . And , a you read from the reaction of the user comment here .. some like this decision , others find the style labouring , dull , and bewildering . I 'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head , but even Franco himself , when quizzed by critic who watched `` Succubus '' , admitted that he did n't even understand the film and he directed it ! Some might say that `` Succubus '' wa merely a precursor to his more admired work , `` Venus in Furs '' , considered his masterwork by Franco-faithful , because it also adopts the surreal , dreamlike structure where the protagonist doe n't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined . In a sense , like the protagonist , we are experiencing the same type of confusion .. certainly , `` Succubus '' is unconventional film-making where we are n't given the key to what is exactly going on . And , a great deal of the elusive dialogue doe n't help matter . `` Succubus '' is also populated by beatnik type and `` poet-speak '' , Corman 's film , `` A Bucket of Blood '' poked fun at . My personal favorite scene tease at a possible lesbian interlude between Lorna and a woman she meet at a posh party .. quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequin are used rather unusually . Great location and jazz score .. I liked this film myself , although I can understand why it doe receive a negative reaction . Loved that one scene at the posh party with Lorna , a wee bit drunk , writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown a others attending the shindig ( .. equally wasted ) rush her in an embrace of kiss .",1

"Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel . I have not read the book so I really did n't know that much about the plot , and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot . There were also many scene that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing . The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it . Of course there were all the scene I disliked but the majority wa well acted and funny . Gwyneth Paltrow give one of her best performance a the heroine in Emma . The film also star Toni Collette ( Who ha okay but ha been much better ) Ewan Mecgreger ( Who ha also been better but he is still very good here ) Alan Cumming ( Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here ) and Jeremy Northam ( Who 's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle , even if that wa not what it needed ) There have been much better adaptation of Jane Austen book but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching .",1
"Why do I hate this ? Let me list the way : I have nothing against Mary Pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid . There 's a fight scene in which kid are throwing brick at each other and it 's considered funny -- -and it go on for 15 minute Strange how none of the kid are even remotely hurt The title card contain plenty of racial and ethnic slur For a `` family '' film the fight were WAY too violent ( loved it when Pickford wa punching it out with a little boy ! ) and the humor wa just stupid Seriously , 40 minute in I gave up and turned it off . The slur , racism and little kid throwing brick at each other got to me . Also there wa no plot that I could see . The only thing worth seeing in this film wa William Haines who wa a top leading man in the silent era . Just painful . Avoid .",0
"Thank God this wa n't based on a true story , because what a story it is . Populated by despicable character whose depravity know no bound , Before The Devil is a mesmerizing , jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable ( and sometimes is , even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout ) if it were n't carried out with such magnificent , overwhelming conviction by it star . The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doe n't hurt either . The main dysfunction here is of a family nature , with the two majorly screwed up brother ( brilliant portrayal from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke ) deciding to rob their own parent ' jewelry store , an attempt that go pathetically awry . The story is told with time-shifts ( which are noted on screen , such a : `` Charlie : Two Days Before The Robbery '' , so no one should be confused ) ; some people have said they did n't like this device but I thought it worked perfectly , adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair , considering that the two brother in question are hardly playing with full deck - between them you could n't make a decent poker hand to save your life . Throw in these cheesy extra tidbit : one of the brother is a drug addict , married to Gina ( Marisa Tomei , also excellent ) , who is having an affair with the other brother , toss in some monumental sibling rivalry , along with the fact that said drug addict brother hate his father ( a wrenching performance from Albert Finney ) , who ha apparently caused him serious past pain , and you 've got a Shakespearean/Greek tragedy on your hand . Proceed with caution .",1

"The movie wa gripping from start to finish and it b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning . We feel we are right there with them a they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again . Near the end of the movie , the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake look like small river of sweat and tear rolling down his face . In the end , we follow them up the stairway to their final moment . The two criminal , performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson , a Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town . Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith , the guy with star in his eye from the wrong side of town . This point is made in the movie and it always surprise u that criminal are no different in appearance than anyone else . Evil , even the most vile , is part of the human condition . These two delusional men kill an entire family , looking for a safe that is n't there . Once on the run , they start writing bad cheque , carving out a trail for the authority . There are many fine supporting actor . I like John Forsyth a the detective on the case , Alvin Dewey . Also , Will Geer shine in a brief but excellent scene a the prosecuting attorney . I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through , having only caught it in short snatch ; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD . The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen . Do n't miss this brilliant movie . To me , this is what great film-making is all about .",1
"This is a great show with total freshness and innovation . That usual chair ( couch for a woman ) host , that mandatory band playing monotonous tune , the same old joke , the same pattern copied from the day of Nebuchadnezzer .... probably the pattern of Johnny Carson , copied by one and all , Latterman , Leno , Conan ... Daly , this show doe not seem to have any of these . I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minute and I am going to stick to it . Though it 's too early to say that , this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk show try so hard to project , and I hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest . I hope that this show will last long ! Returning back after month , I still love this show , and I love his self-deprecating humor ( For example , his affirmation that only pothead loner would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and thus , the joke are funny only to the stoned guy ) which , however , doe not involve the usual monkeying of Conan O'Brien , for example ( I know it 's a cardinal sin to be repelled by O'Brien 's antic ; but I do really dislike his style and repetitiveness ) . I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it . Ferensen 's spoof of Trading Spouses ( and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode ) are hilarious . Idiot paparazzo are fun , especially when a security guard caution them against taking people 's picture , and ( if I am not mistaken ) they start taking his picture shouting `` Gary Coleman '' . Added on 16th April , 2007 : Coming back once again , I am left confused by the neighbor and her dog . I can not decide if it is a joke or a real thing . Either way , it wa funny a hell . I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these page , but maybe he doe . He is crazier than a bunch of monkey and so , I would better write down my suggestion here for him : I would like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon , the star of late night TV commercial . I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike 's talk show , sing a song ( and play guitar ) , do a skit in the line of SNL , and also to answer question from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of Los Angeles ( I know , Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this , but there are website detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of LA ) . God willing ! Returning back on 14th July , 2007 : Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike 's talkshow must be bribed by Spike . I confess that Spike really bribed me , but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford .",1
"It 's all about getting what you want when you want it . And the message of Bluebeard 's Eighth WIfe is to be careful what you wish for , until what you wish for wish for you . Most men have heard the story about what happens when your sexual frustration is n't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue . Misogynistic pirate aside , Cooper play a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he want whenever he want it , learning only too late that it wa n't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he run into the feisty Claudette Colbert . Through a twisted ( in soul and in practice ) business deal , he end up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her , but she will have none of it ( literally ) and frustrates him at every turn , and corner , and room , and tourist attraction . The film ha definite French sensibility which mean it ha strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you 're not accustomed to ( and may not enjoy seeing ) in either Cooper or Colbert . The whole reason I watched the film wa because they are `` likable '' actor , and the whole point of this movie is that they 're unlikable people , or at least likable people who have developed unlikable trait to protect themselves , they think , from the world . If you can accept it on it own term you 'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film ... and satisfaction , a we said , is what it 's all about . Such a movie with such a cast only come around , after all , once in a ... ummm ... blue moon .",1
"Now i have read some negative review for this show on this website and quite frankly I 'm appalled . For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i 'm afraid i do n't know what the world ha come to . Let me tell u something . I started watching many T.V show like Lost , Prison Break , Dexter , Deadwood and even Invasion . But all of those show lost their touch after the first season , especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the company took 2 genius idea and butchered them by making more than one season . Then we have The Sopranos . I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of it season , and more importantly all of it episode . There is no department that this show doe n't excel in . Acting- Nothing short of superb . James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actor and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode , after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would 've been the better choice , however after watching the first few episode , i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James a Tony . The raw emotion he display is superb . Then we have everyone else , Edie Falco , Michael Imperioli , Lorraine Bracco , Dominic Chianese ( whom i remembered a Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part 2 ) and my personal two favourite character Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie 'Walnuts ' Gualtieri and Silvio Dante . All of these actor perform to the best quality , and all giving an excellent performance in each episode . Then we have the story , never have i been so sucked into a T.V show before . The story is nothing short of excellent . Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic . I feel that The Sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of . Its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence , but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television , and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show . Not just say it too violent , or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral , i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day , i do n't think that the character are going to be very honest or loyal to God . I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me , you 'll be hooked from the very first episode , i wa and i have even gotten a few friend who had firstly refused to watch the show , hooked on it . Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that come on T.V . After you 've watched the first season , you 'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television , and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos .",1
"I 'd give this a negative rating if I could . I went into this movie not expecting much , but I had an open mind . The whole thing is stupid ! The snake are obviously fake and the first two thing they bite are a boob and a guy johnson . Oh how original ; if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that . I have no idea how this movie became so popular . Seriously , the worst thing I 've ever seen . I wa n't entertained , it wa n't funny , I wa n't even bored ! I wa n't anything . It wa n't even so bad it wa good , it 's just bad . Ridiculous actually . Please do not waste your money on this movie . Do n't even rent this movie . No clue how it 's getting such a high rating .",0
"Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists . Fox , which paid Judge to make it , ha kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it . I guess that made many people think it wa one of the garbage movie being flushed in late summer . Well , I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe . Basically , Judge put forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin . Then these stupid are getting more stupid , by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex , which produce more stupid people . By 2500 , a person of average intelligence today , will appear to be a genius , that talk `` all faggy . '' Seriously , is this really that hard to believe . Oh sure , this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid , but still plausible . Luke Wilson is great a the time traveling army guy , hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time . Where this story will gain it cult status is with the numerous funny one-liner , like `` can we family style her '' and `` hey man , I 'm 'bating here ! '' This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure , comfort and stupidity , and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it come out and watching it over and over .",1
"This is a great , ridiculous horror movie that capture the essence of the mid to late 80 ' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly wa . I can remember being freaked out by metal teen when I wa a kid . It doe n't help that I found a desecrated grave in my hometown 's graveyard when I wa ten . Turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old body and used their bone in some weird sacrifice to satan . So maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile , but I love it now , a a 24 year old . I bought this DVD used for 6 buck and I expected it to suck due to the lame cover , but to my surprise , it ruled . It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal . And you got ta love a scene where a guitar shoot lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd . This movie is awesome , if you love 80 metal and bad movie , this one 's for you . 9/10 !",1
"While not quite a good a A Murder is Announced , which wa not only delightful but almost surpassed the book , this is an excellent adaptation . And you know what , it is a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version . Now I do n't take pride in bad mouthing the Geraldine McEwan adaptation , two or three of them were surprisingly good , but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script , a confusing final solution or both . The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from a plodding pace , and both of the above problem , and I would consider second worst of the ITV adaptation , worst being Sittaford Mystery , which even on it own merit turned out dull and confusing . This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement , it not only respect the book , despite a few liberty , but it pretty much rectifies the problem the ITV version had . Despite the added character of Lionel coming across a rather irritating , more to do with how he wa written than how he wa acted , and one or two moment of sluggish pacing , this is solid a an adaptation of a decent book . It is beautifully filmed , with nice photography and period detail , and the music a always is excellent . The performance are wonderful this time around , and make the most of an in general well-done script , with Joan Hickson brilliant a always a Miss Marple , and solid turn from Liz Fraser , Helen Cherry , Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper . Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance a Clothilde . Overall , well worth watching , better than the recent version in pretty much all department . 9/10 Bethany Cox",1
"Good Lord , what were they THINKING ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! Here is your spoiler warning , even though I do n't think it 'll really matter . You wo n't be seeing this piece of trash anyway . A group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people , who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them , and the puppet complicate thing by letting them live out their really stupid fantasy . In other word , the whole thing is really stupid . You KNOW it ha to be bad when even Mike and the Bots ca n't save something ! ! And they did n't ! I know , some of their line were funny , like what to add to the sign `` HIT '' and the hand comment , but , geez , this wa pretty dang sad . All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE O CRUD . IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR EYES .",0
"I had heard ( and read ) so many good thing about Weeds that I wa looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series ( like Entourage , Sopranos or Mad Men ) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One . ( did n't make it past the first six episode ) The writing wa unoriginal , contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing . The dialog felt forced , like the writer are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It wa a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh . The character never developed enough for me to care about them , they were selfish and unappealing . I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brother-in-law ( who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator ) and the removal of the Hodes ' daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico wa so unoriginal and cliché , I had to conclude the writer were testing the viewer 's loyalty . Episode after episode I liked the character le and could n't get past many of the technical flaw in the story line . Add to that I heard that Season Two wa n't a good , so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out . If you 're a fan of good casting and writing , I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like , unless of course you 're stoned and then all bet are off .",0
"This movie is among my favorite foreign film , some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog . The similarity with those movie a with so many great foreign film , is that it take a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson . In Japan , a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life , see a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio . In the instant that it take his train to pas , he is enthralled by her . But is it only by her beauty , by her faraway glance , or a connection that they will both discover that they share ? Shall We Dance ha memorable wonderful character who have to deal with painful reality by transcending them through the world of dance . Breaking traditional mould and stereo type of Japanese society , they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away . It is one of those movie that is so magical and meaningful and , in itself , transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be .",1
"As if the film were not of value in itself , this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel a a preface to reading it . In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC ; that fall in graduate school , I read the book for the first time . Some of the pleasure in reading the novel wa my memory of the scrupulously detailed film . And for better or worse -- and I 've now read and taught the novel for over three decade -- Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom .",1
"This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eye an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution . It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love . The name CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempt to wrongly market this a an action film . DREAMING OF JULIA make much more sense . It ha more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people 's daily life and pursuit . That fact alone make the film more honest than most work dealing with this time period in Cuban history . The excessive use of the voice-over narrator doe undermine the story but the film make up for it with unqualified clip from Hollywood film that say so much more visually than the narrator could . The comparison to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game a the film doe wax melancholy about movie , but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love . The revolution , like the film JULIE , never seems to have an ending .",1
"I saw ZP when it wa first released and found it a major disappointment . Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey '60s . It 's politics too upfront and ridiculous . And let 's face it , I wa still under a love-spell known a BLOWUP : and I still have n't completely shaken it . Now the `` love '' is twisted up with all sort of nostalgia it evokes and , oh well . . . Good Luck to me ! But time march on and time ha been kind to ZP and time ha been a teacher to me . I revisit this film about every ten year and it just get better and better with age . And ZP is it 's own `` experience '' and is only really linked to BLOWUP through it creator , the late , great Mr. Antonioni . Twelve year ago , I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print , projected at it correct size ( immense ) , restored by an Italian government cultural agency who know a good work of art when they see it and know the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape . To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared . It wa like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake u up to a new level of awareness . And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of `` place '' . What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into it own . I remember the second time around seeing it -- - the early 80 -- - I had begun to feel affection towards the film a a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular . Whereas , before these two seemed like a smart-alecky shadow version of Zefferelli 's Olivia and Leonard ( read : Romeo and Juliet ) they now were engaging me -- - particularly The Girl in her insistent slo-motion-ality . She-took-her-time . . . To Live . Everything , EVERYTHING dy around her . Upon exciting the theater the daylight of Reality quickly began to erase my new found `` enjoyment '' . The encroaching shoulder-padded , big haired 80 whispered `` But that 's a hippie fantasy -- - let it go '' The force of Antonioni 's vision had , I had realised , already worked itself inside of me the FIRST time around so I answered `` 80 '' with an `` Uh-Huh '' and guarded my `` love '' secretly , possessively and jealously . But , this , then is what good art doe it life inside of you , and , if you wish it ha it way and `` love '' you back : secretly , jealously , and possessively . And you get `` changed '' . Was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in it March lineup . Undoubtedly , ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into it constructed environment . But , hey , sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all . Today reality hit , ZP ha been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antic of ALICE 'S RESTAURANT . So , it is still too `` difficult '' , too `` disturbing '' , too `` what '' ? Maybe it 's that , a with all good art , it Lives while everything dy around it . Peace .",1
"Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story , but benefiting from it stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice , gruesome make-up effect . Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl , carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13 . Nightmares and hallucination lead her further into believing she 's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who wa said to be a werewolf . She kill her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and get submitted in a hospital . She escape again , however , and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detective , doctor and relative . It 's all pretty to look at and listen too ( really great soundtrack ) , but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast . Luckily enough , leading lady Annik Borel rarely ever wear clothes and she fill up the boring moment by dancing naked around a fire . The film is too long , too weird and too forgettable . The biggest surprise come at the end , when suddenly and out of the blue , director Rino Di Silvestro try to make u believe that his movie wa based on true fact . Yeah , right ...",0
"This is an interesting , hard to find movie from the early 70 's starring Jan Michael Vincent a a young man who doe n't make the cut a a marine . Dressed in 'baby blue ' outfit to humiliate them a they are sent home , the failed recruit are sent packing . Vincent stop at a bar and run into a very young Richard Gere who ha just returned from a tour in the Pacific a a hard-core Marine 'Raider ' . Gere 's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion , and he take advantage of Vincent 's innocence , stealing his 'baby blue ' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway . Vincent 's character , whose name is Marion , take Gere 's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine 'Raider ' . Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stop at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town . In the local café he meet Rose Hudkins , who immediately catch his eye . Staying with Hudkins parent , Marion attracts all sort of attention from the town folk . Mr Hudkins suspect Marion and wonder how a Marine 'Raider ' could still be so innocent . The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps , a the town folk go 'hunting ' 3 escapee . Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt . But there 's still a happy ending , which befuddled me a bit . I would have preferred a little more drama ! Anyway , this capture JMV at the peak of his 70 's performance . BUSTER AND BILLIE , BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70 's were amazingly good JMV performance . He wa both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time ! ! ! He made a lot of quality movie during his career , and continued to do so up into the mid 80 's with the great TV show Airwolf . He doe a very good job in this a 'Hedge ' , quietly observing the way people treat him ( in his uniform ) a he travel across the country . He must have performed some of the stunt work a well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it look like he 's the guy getting tossed down the river to me ! But really , at the height of his popularity , this movie could have done so much more with JMV 's talent and his look . Innocence can only be so interesting . Evil , a explored in `` Buster and Billie '' , is much more dramatic ! Anyway , Glynnis O'Connor is delightful a Rose . The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting . The outdoor scene are gorgeous - must have been filmed in Canada .",1
"Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel story . The music is great , you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like ( I 've been there too ) , and June get into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion . Cash 's narration is good too . But .... 1 . The actor who played Jesus wa miscast . 2 . There is no edge to the story like Cash put in some of his faith based music . 3 . Because it is uncompelling , I doubt we 'll see this ever widely distributed again . I 'd love to buy the CD . Tom Paine Texas , USA",1
"Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva 's most political movie . It take stance strongly against modern day society 's authority status in the life of the common man , and how it ha estranged men from the nature completely . It challenge the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society . Vatanen ( Antti Litja ) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all it rule and regulation - try to rattle the chain of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern Finland - only to realize that the concept of a 'free country ' is n't all that unambiguous , in other word , the society ha the common man by the ball . Still the thing that make Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humouristic brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in Finland in the 70 's , a well a the whole identity of Finland a a nation . Vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness . Since nature ha always played such an important role in the national identity of u Finns , the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society make Jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving .",1
"I love Jamie Foxx . And I enjoy 99 % of all movie I see . And I walked out of this one . Now , I admit , it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white woman in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing ( `` Oh no , Jamie 's knocking on a door ! HEE HEE HEE ! `` ) , but ... this wa just so incredibly annoying . There could be no sustained camera shot , and no camera shot from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in-your-face , loud , and annoying . The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like , but at this point , it 's just old and tired . He brought nothing new or interesting . From all the character , too many line you saw coming , too many you 've heard before , and too many `` tough guy '' line ... and I do n't mind that sort of thing , really , a long a there 's a bit of originality to it . In fact , pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked . I love Jamie Foxx , and I think he 's really funny , and I thought he wa funny in this movie ... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else . This movie needed le shoot-em-up , le annoying camera shot , more emotion , more feeling , and more Jamie Foxx . I gave it a 2 .",0
"After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99 $ bin at Future Shop I decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movie . I wa very surprised to see a very fun , smart entertaining movie with solid performance throughout . The movie move along well , it ha of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty , but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna . I wa happy to find out that Pacino wa nominated for his performance a an over the top gangster trying to take down the city . Madonna wa great a the damsel in distress , she really impressed me and added depth to her performance . If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun , smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try . I do n't think you will be disappointed . And Watch for the cameo from Paul Sorvino , James Caan , Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others .",1
Send them to the freezer . This is the solution two butcher find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh . An incredible story with humor and possible allegory that make it much more than a horror film . The complex character defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it . Definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive .,1
"Wow ! I picked this off the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting . ' This is a phenomenal movie ; it ha action , romance , suspense , intrigue and wit . When I wa n't laughing , I wa at the edge of my seat . This is definitely a film I would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century . This film ha everything to keep ME happy !",1
"I do n't know why some people criticise that show so much . It is a great , funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time , but still ... The family dynamic are funny , and all in all the same you see in most comedy show . The supporting character are absolutely hilarious . The plot of the individual episode and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibe are only just above average , but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liner that make you roll on the floor laughing . This show wa well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it . rating : 8/10",1
"Mexican Werewolf in Texas is set in the small border town of Furlough where Anna ( Erika Fay ) life , her best friend is Rosie ( Martine Hughes ) & she ha a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel ( Gabriel Gutierrez ) who are determined to track a beast down that ha been terrorising the town , killing livestock & several resident including some of their friend . Local Mexican legend speak of the Chupacabra , an evil creature from myth & legend . Erm , I 'm struggling now because not that much else actually happens ... Written & directed by Scott Maginnis I wo n't beat about the bush here & simply say that Mexican Werewolf in Texas is awful , period . The script only ever mention the word Werewolf once & the rest of the time it 's referred to a Chupacabra , in fact I suspect this wa n't really conceived a a Werewolf flick at all . The 'Werewolf ' creature look mostly hairless & more like some vicious dog , there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon & it actually attack during the day on a couple of occasion , there is no transformation scene & at the end when it is killed it doe n't change back into anyone either . To be honest apart from the title there 's nothing here to indicate a Werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a rip-off of the highly popular An American Werewolf in London ( 1981 ) . This is the type of home made crap that I personally think is killing the horror genre , how long ha it been since there wa a true low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) , The Evil Dead ( 1981 ) , Halloween ( 1978 ) or Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) which were all made on shoe string budget , maybe The Blair Witch Project ( 1999 ) but that 's it in recent year & crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas ha absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic . The character 's are awful & thing just happen around them , the dialogue is rubbish , the pacing is terrible , the story suck & virtually sent me to sleep & a a whole this film is just crap , I 'm sorry but I do n't know how else to describe it . Director Maginnis doe nothing to make this watchable , there 's the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache & quick 'blink & you 'll miss something ' editing which just annoys & irritates in equal measure . It 's not scary , there 's no nudity , there 's no tension or atmosphere & the special effect are awful . The monster really doe look poor & it 's no wonder Maginnis keep it in the shadow or cut his scene so quickly you never get a good look at it . There 's virtually no colour to the picture either , it 's either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand orange which make the thing an eye sore a well . The gore consists of some fake gut ( blink & you 'll miss them ! ) , a few bloody wound & a severed arm , big deal . With a supposed budget of about $ 300,000 I admit the budget wa low but I simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film , there are plenty of low budget horror flick that make their meagre budget go far . The whole thing ha the look of a home movie , it ha no style & is throughly bland & dull to look at . The acting suck too although you probably already knew that . Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably con a few people into renting/buying/watching it because they might mistakenly think it 's a sequel to John Landis ' classic which it most certainly is n't & it is n't even a proper Werewolf flick either . Do n't be fooled this is awful & I 'm fed up of having to waste time/money on home made amateur crap like this .",0
"I found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950 's culture-clash movie . John Wayne would hardly be one 's first choice a a cultural attache , being about a diplomatic with his good intention a a bull-run in Harrods . But this time he wa left to play a part that wa far more passive than his usual bluff persona , and he accomplished his task with style . The Duke wa a guy who really could act well . His facial expression and body language could be extremely subtle . Despite his considerable presence both a an actor and in term of screen time , he failed to dominate this movie . Many of his good intention came a cropper . He had authority over nobody , and the intermittent narrative wa provided by the titular geisha to whom he wa the barbarian . The story of American attempt to curry favour with an isolationist Japan wa one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battle . I can not comment on the accuracy of it research but the strangeness of the Oriental culture to western sensibility wa demonstrated well . There wa a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and prop . The set piece were complex and detailed . A lot of money and thought had been applied to it . The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element , and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort . Script wa good without being too wordy . There wa a great deal of Japanese dialogue , but the lengthy period of translation did n't interfere with the narrative . It wa nice to see plenty of genuine oriental on the set . Whether or not they were Japanese , I could n't say . But anyway they looked the part . At least the lead were not played by cross-dressing Caucasians , unlike other effort such a 'Blood Alley ' ( yes , I know they were Chinese ) 'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness ' or even 'The King And I ' . Frankly , I enjoyed this more than any of those other movie . The script wa better for a start . I never liked the song in 'The King And I ' , and wa n't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'Blood Alley ' . I confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of The Duke 's more popular outing . Recommended .",1
"I wa so glad I came across this short film . I 'm always so disappointed that short film are hard to come across , so when I saw this and saw that it wa nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards , I wa so pleased that I actually had a film that I wa rooting for . The plot is pretty simple , the director , writer , and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musical . The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy . It 's a well made short film , well edited and the actor all do a great job . And the last shot of the film is perfect . I highly recommend this film .",1
"I thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one , but when i started with it i found it really awful . They said movie is being made in Afghanistan but i think 95 % of the movie is shot in India . you can see Indian made car . you can see lars drinking bisleri ( an Indian water brand ) , Hindi written on the road , you can also see temple in Afghanistan * hahah * it really funny and many more stuff which prof it not shot in Afghanistan . I think one should not waste his/her time watching this movie .. pure time waste .. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but do n't watch this waste of time",0
"Truly appalling waste of space . Me and my friend tried to watch this film to it conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minute from the end . And i can count the film I have switched off before the end on one hand . The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring . I would n't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off script from 1983 . For example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone . I mean seriously . The police would be beating his door down in minute . The scene and event just wash by you like turd in a river . It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film . The narrative flick between character in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempt at building the character . Oh and what `` character '' they are . The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful . He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed . After 60 or so minute of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character . He is neither sympathetic nor hateful . Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene . His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery . Is he happy ? Is he sad ? Angry ? No idea . Just those same dead eye staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh . And the native American theme is just awful and pointless . The good guy are at best unlikeable . A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex-wife stereotype . Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy , `` you are n't going to shoot me '' that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying . The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character . Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guy in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated . Roasario Dawsons character start with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangster chick scene from Jackie Brown . You really want me to believe her character wa SO attracted to Rourke 's ? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleep with anything that move ? Realistic female character FTW ! In summary a complete mess of a film . Hopeless characterisation and performance . A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction . And ultimately extremely dull . Its not even comedy bad either . Laughing at Rourkes haggard face get pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minute of the film .",0
"In this movie , Chávez supporter ( either venezuelan and not-venezuelan ) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country . They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez announcement firing a lot of PDVSA best worker just for political issue . They did not say anything about more than 96 TV interruption transmitted by Chávez during only 3 day in `` CADENA NACIONAL '' ( a kind of confiscation o private TV signal ) . Each one with about 20 minute of duration . They did not tell u anything about The quiting announcement made by General en Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero , Inspector General of the army force , who is a traditional supporter of Chávez . Even now , in despite of his announcement , he is the Ministro de Interior y Justicia . After Chávez return he occuped the Charge of Ministro del Defensa ( equal to Defense Secretary in US ) . They did not say anything about Chávez order about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who wa claiming for election . They did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by Chávez Supporters ( either civilian and Military official force ) . They present some fact in a wrong order , in order to lie . They did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an election in order to solve the crisis and Chávez action in order to avoid the election . That 's why i tell you .... This movie is just a lot of lie or a big lie .",0
"One could wish that an idea a good a the `` invisible man '' would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effect , but this is not the case . The story , the character and , finally the entire last 20 minute of the film are about a fresh a a mad-scientist flick from the early 50 's . There are some great moment , mostly due to the amazing special effect and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the street . But ala , soon we 're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab , which mean that the rest of the film is not only predictable , but schematic . There ha been a great many remake of old film or TV show over the past 10 year , and some of them have their charm . But it 's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol ' classic under the nose of eager madman like Verhoeven ( who doe have his moment ) is a very bad one . It is obvious that the money is the key issue here : the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough , and a a result , `` Hollow Man '' is seriously undermined with clichés , sappy character , predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever . However , the one thing that actually impressed me , beside the special effect , wa the swearing . When making this kind of film , modern producer are very keen on allowing kid to see them . Therefore , the language ( and , sometimes , the violence and sex ) is very toned down . When the whole world blow up , the good guy go `` Oh darn ! '' and `` Oh my God '' . `` Hollow Man '' gratefully discard that kind of hypocrisy and the character are at liberty to say what come most natural to them . I 'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it make it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears . I think we can thank Verhoeven for that .",0
"OK , so it owes Pulp Fiction , but in my opinion ha it 's own voice and identity mainly because of the music-video direction style , sketch-like narrative and great performance . Thomas Jane delivers great ( the drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary ) , Aaron Eckhart likewise . James LeGros ha a short and effervescent appearance-great humor- '' they got the Wong house '' . The Porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable , a is Mickey Rourke 's cameo appearance- '' take a peak '' . Great Hollywood popcorn B-production with strong performance of A-level aspirant and renegade ( Rourke ) . Well , take a peak , it 's worth .",1
"As far a I know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it wa an outstanding portrayal , I 'd agree with him . This is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy/man with a special body part helping him . Oscar and BAFTA winning , and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis play Christy Browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor , in a wheelchair and carried by his family . He ha a special left foot though , he can write with it , paint with it and hold thing with it . He learns to speak later in the film , it is very good for a guy like him . Also starring Home Alone 2 's Oscar winning , and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker a Mrs. Brown and BAFTA winning Ray McAnally a Mr. Brown . It wa nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan , Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture , it wa nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film , Best Make Up Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay . Daniel Day-Lewis wa number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he wa number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , he wa number 9 on Britain 's Finest Actors , and he wa number 15 on The World 's Greatest Actor , and the film wa number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films . Outstanding !",1
"All I ever heard while being raised wa equality of the sex , and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance , but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better . All the while watching I wa hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel a though there is hope for the future , and there wa n't . I 'll admit to not finishing the film , I had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man Adam that it wa ok to be a whore and get , and I quote , `` More tail than any man in the past time . '' I know not finishing it is a bad review on myself , but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested , and they failed . This film betrays all true female nature quality of the mother figure and the need for balance . Instead it exemplifies what America ran by lesbian natzis would be like , and I 'm not against lesbian . Thank you Mr. Director ! Someone please give me a redeeming quality ... wait I have it ! There 's no sequel !",0
"I do regret that I have bought this series . I expected more action , more objective picture and more consistency . This is just a pure propaganda series , very dark , without any charm , or romanticism , it is just boredom itself . I find the actor work quite weak a well . O'Donnell might seem charming a Robin ( with Batman ) , but in this picture he lack any charm . Probably while he becomes older , he is loosing his childish charm but doe not gain any charm of a grown up . It come a no surprise , that it wa not shown in a lot of country and is being sold in the UK for 40 % of the recommended price and wa not even released in the Netherlands .",0
"The story ha been told before . A deadly disease is spreading around ... But the extra in this film is Peter Weller , his interpretation of Muller on the run is real . He is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child . This person could be working next to you .",1
"This film wa very well advertised . I am an avid movie goer and have seen preview for this movie for month . While I wa somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be , my friend thought it wa going to be great and hyped me up about it . Then I went and saw it , I wa sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie . I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I wa in , plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie ! I always go into a movie with an open mind , not trying to go into them with too many expectation , but this movie wa not that funny . Now it wasnt the worst movie I 've ever seen , but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO . If you havent seen many preview for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedy you may enjoy it , but for true comedy fan Id say pas . Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again . Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead ! ! !",0
"As far a I know this wa my first experience with Icelandic movie . It 's such a relief to see something else than your regular Hollywood motion picture . Too bad that movie like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world . I can only hope that people watch this by accident , by recommendation or other ... Because it 's really worth while . I left the cinema feeling really sad . I could n't get the tragic destiny 's of the character out of my head . And it impressed me even more when I thought of the complexity of the film . Not only wa it a tragic story , it had excellent comic relief and a very good soundtrack . If you have the opportunity , watch it ! It 's really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot .",1
"Very typical Almodóvar of the time and , in it own way , no le funny than many of his later work . And why is that ? There is nothing to be provoked or shocked about , and I guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional . No , the great humor stem from an underlying , almost surreal , absurdity that is woven into the scenery : The character ' nearly complete lack of taboo . It 's the same kind of 'comic suspense ' you find in his later work , though you 'll find it in a more rough version here . He 's building up for masterpiece to come , but is not yet there . The sole reviewer who commented on this movie before I did , claimed that it had to be a `` very select '' group of people who 'd find this movie hilarious . I do .",1
"Once again , Doctor Who delivers the good by the bucket load . It ha humour ( `` You 're just making it up a you go along ! '' `` Yup , but I do it brilliantly '' ) , action , monster ( in this case still more kick-ass cybermen ) , tragedy and scare tactic . In short , just what the doctor ordered ( pun intended ) . The way that the emotion move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of `` get on with it '' . So , chalk up 3 out of the last 4 episode that have made you laugh , then made you cry , and made you go `` eek '' . In term of character development , this is clearly the clincher for Noel Clarke 's Mickey ( and Ricky ) . Being one of the Doctor 's companion , you know that he will do the right thing , and may even suspect the manner that he doe it . However , it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path . While `` The rise of the Cybermen '' had more of the sinister build up to terror , `` The Age of Steel '' is an all out blast . Like `` Alien '' compared to `` Aliens '' - both true classic , but in different way . Can the series keep it up at this level ? Let 's hope so .",1
"A Brother 's Promise is a wonderful family film . This is a biography of Dan Jansen , a champion Olympic speed skater . The movie depicts this athlete 's life from a young age through full adulthood . The love and support of the family member is evident throughout . How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing race is a life lesson for all of u . The commitment and determination of Dan 's coach and his teammate , show what it take to make a real team . How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating . The faith of the family is shown in basic term and is obviously a major part of their life . This is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age .",1
"Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his `` House of 1,000 Corpses '' crapfest , I can now rest in peace . Nothing about the somnambulant performance or trite script would raise the dead in `` The House of Seven Corpses , '' but a groovie ghoulie come up from his plot ( ha ! ) anyway , to kill the bloody amateur making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode ! In Hell House ( sorry , I do n't remember the actual name of the residence ) , a bunch of mysterious , unexplained death took place long ago ; some , like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine ( whose small role provides the film 's only worthwhile moment ) , attribute it to the supernatural ; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it a superstitious hokum . The result come across like `` Satan 's School for Girls '' ( catchy title ; made-for-TV production value ; intriguing plot ) crossed with `` Children Should n't Play With Dead Things '' ( low-rent movie about low-rent movie maker who wake the dead ) ; trouble is , it 's nowhere near a entertaining or fun . `` The House of Seven Corpses '' is dead at frame one , and spends the rest of it 89 minute going through rigor mortis , dragging u along for every aching second ...",0
"Director Sidney Lumet ha made some masterpiece , like Network , Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico.But , he wa not having too much luck on his most recent works.Gloria ( 1999 ) wa pathetic and Find Me Guilty wa an interesting , but failed experiment.Now , Lumet brings his best film in decade and , by my point of view , a true masterpiece : Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead.I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet.This movie ha an excellent story which , deeply , ha many layers.Also , I think the ending of the movie is perfect.The performance are brilliant.Philip Seymour Hoffman brings , a usual , a magnificent performance and he 's , no doubt , one of the best actor of our days.Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor but he 's underrated by my point of view.His performance in here is great.The rest of the cast is also excellent ( specially , the great Albert Finney ) but these two actor bring monumental performance which were sadly ignored by the pathetic Oscars.The film ha a good level of intensity , in part thanks to the performance and , in part , thanks to the brilliant screenplay.Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction , a great screenplay and excellent performances.We need more movie like this .",1
"I took my 14 year old to see this movie . We left after 15 or 20 minute . It wa absolutely awful ! This movie should be rated R at the least . I am not that strict with movie but , this wa just too much . It wa a waste of money . I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but , this wa WAY beyond crude . I wa sitting there watching and reading ( a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie wa what really got me ) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it wa . I could not believe that it would be OK for a 13 year old to read and see this content . I do n't understand how the rating system works. ? ?",0

"It 's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS ( it 's not available on DVD ) , but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection . I ca n't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman get into these mediocre film ? Judas Kiss boast several wonderful actor , an interesting plot and intriguing twist , but it strange visual wandering and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama . Many scene seem to be missing vital information to explain the character 's action : Why wa our hero immediately suspicious of his boss ? Why did he mistrust the detective he replaced ? There were time when I honestly could n't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof . Why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minute ( that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kid were playing nearby ! ) ? Did he purposely instruct his two distinguished English actor ( Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson ) to use such awful New Orlean 's accent ? As an Alan Freak , I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman wa sexy : in a rumpled , weary , `` take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in '' sort of way . Judas Kiss is n't a great movie , but it doe have some intriguing moment , but I do n't recommend it unless you 're trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman .",0
"First of all , I should point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary . Not only it had great music in it , but the shot and the editing were also wonderful . However , all these positive thing about the film doe not change the fact that it play to the orientalist `` East meet West '' cliché that bother many Turks like myself . Okay , this film tell the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing , something that would show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about murdering Armenians and Kurds . However , the problematic of the film is that it look at what it defines a `` east '' from the eye of the `` west '' . I mean , like one jazz musician say in the film , maybe there is no east and west , maybe it is just a myth , a lie created by the ruling leader of `` western '' country in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and `` keep the cash flowing '' ? Why do n't you think about that ?",1
"STMD ! is not a terrible movie , but it IS quite forgettable . The lighting is intentionally poor in many scene and unintentionally poor in all the rest , so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain . Special effect are imaginative , but obvious . The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flick is there , of course , along with the archetypical teenager , but the whole movie just doe n't gel . What wa needed wa some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor . I ca n't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie . I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor , but these are sadly lacking in this film .",0
"First off , I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen . Its not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie , it just awful . Me and my friend who love action movie , Independence day , Jurassic Park , LotR , etc . went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragon , mindless entertainment . All we got wa a mindless hour and a half . The CG wa not a bad a I wa expecting , but the plot is so awful along with the acting , it made up for it . Its basically a Chinese legged of dragon returning every 500 year ... Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire ? No , The plot try to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot hole , but with magic , and a very small actual war between dragon ( rather big snake ) it just get ridiculous . The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail . Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing ( along with all 5 of the audience ) , and cant believed we spent money on this . The short trailer on TV make up for most of the action while crap make up the rest . I 've seen a lot of B movie like Reptilian , The Cave , Spider , and others , but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour , watch this . Story : 1/10 CG : 5/10 Acting:3/10 I do n't drink ... but it would have helped before watching this movie",0
"i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie , but i can tell you that i wa thoroughly entertained by this movie . the character of gust , played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman , wa one of the most unique , yet entertaining character in recent memory . this movie informed , yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience . it made me laugh , made me sad , made me feel alive , and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie . it take no time to understand what is going on , and take you on a roller coaster ride of genuine , human emotion . i thought i knew my history , apparently i did n't know it at all ! i give this move 9 out of 10 , and recommend it for all adult , and young adult , and the young at heart , just not the young . but a soon a they are allowed to see `` r '' rated movie , make it a priority .",1
"I must have seen this a dozen time over the year . I wa about fifteen when I first saw it in B & W on the local PBS station . I bought a DVD set for the child to see , and am making them watch it . They do n't teach history in School , and this explains the most critical event of the 20th Century . It expands their critical thinking . Impartially , with the participant on all side explaining in their own word what they did and why , it detail what lead up to the war and the actual war .

"Steven Seagal 's film of late have not exactly been good , but this is by far the worst since The Patriot . The plot make no sense what so ever ; it is never clear in what the relationship between the character are , who work for who or who is double crossing who . The film is completely disjointed , each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward . Even the action sequence are uninspired and hard to follow . Most of the blame must lie at the director 's foot for not even understanding the basic of film making , but Seagal doe not get off lightly , a one of the producer of this film , he must also share the blame . Oh , and I have n't even mentioned how awful the acting is , even by Seagal standard . Even a straight to video fodder , this is not worth a view even for Seagal fan . Give it a wide berth !",0
"and I for one think that is a good thing . I 've just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original wa my favorite RR movie . But I love Bette and wa thrilled to hear she wa making this . As for the rest of the production , I think it wa slightly le than the original movie . One of my favorite minor character in the original wa Mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice belting out `` HEY ! It take a lot more than no talent to be a strippah ! '' and although I missed it , I wa glad to see the producer had the gut not to do a carbon copy . I also liked the fact there are large portion of this movie which were filmed a if you are looking at a stage , it give a feeling that you are in the theatre , not just at the movie . I think the other thing I liked about this production wa that there seemed to be slightly le repetition of the song `` Let me entertain you '' , which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it .",1
"So real and surreal , all in one . I remember feeling like Tessa . Heck , I remember being Tessa . This wa a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending . I especially liked the protester tangent . It is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it . If you get the chance to see this , take it . It is well worth the 30 minute .",1
"Thank God I watched this at a friend 's place and did not pay for it . The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show . If you have any knowledge of computer or electronics , watch out . You will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence . Also , actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh display the worst acting I have ever seen , excluding porn . She 's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent . He 's the one that carry the movie . I hate that I wasted nearly two hour of my life watching this movie ! It 's a shame that they got to call it a sequel , because I wa a fan of the original , which wa actually pretty good .",0
"A friend lent me this DVD , which he got from the director at a festival , I think . I went in warned that some of the technical aspect of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing wa good but not great . So maybe that colored my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie . The standouts where the actor . Youssef Kerkor wa really good a Ernie , the main character , kind of pathetic in a likable way . Adam Jones ( who also directed ) and Justin Lane were excellent a the roommate who drive Ernie mad . The Bill character ( Justin Lane ) , who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda , wa by far my favorite ; he seemed the least one-dimensional , and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD . Really kind of lovable , and very funny . Some of the other acting wa good , some wa so-so , but none of it wa bad . I also really liked the vigilante duo . Ridiculous and funny . I 'm giving this one high mark , even though it ha some issue , because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared , and decided to make their movie their way . Well done to Adam Jones and crew .",1
"Shawshank , Godfather , Pulp Fiction ... all good film . Great film . But nothing , and I mean nothing life up to the greatest Christmas movie of all , Santa Claus . The film is so great and ha so many message , I cried while watching it . Seriously , this is one of those movie you need to watch 10 time . When we see Pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream , we see the sadness in his eye , and we feel the deep sorrow , and then we wonder ... what is so bad about this ice cream ? Is it implying that we a human are treating ice cream a good when all it doe is make u evil ? Think movie make you think . This movie ha the best rendition of Santa Claus ever . Unlike other Santas , he is a normal person . We see him imprisoning child and spying on kid dream , and we wonder ; is the Santa we believe in really that good ? Also , this Santa actually mention Christ , the whole meaning behind Christmas . You owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece . We should just stop making movie and air nothing but this epic 24/7 . Whether it 's Christmas or not , this movie get a 500/10 . Whoever say this movie is bad is an ignorant fool .",1
I really cant think of anything good to say about this film ... not a single thing . The script is a nightmare .. the writer blur the line between chemical and biological trait and doesnt seem to understand the difference . You 'd think they would at least get a technical advisor . The performance were bad by most of the cast ... although I dont really blame them .. the material really stink . The editing wa equally bad .. I 'll just stop now .. it all bad 2/10,0
"Cinema 's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy 's Neo-Realist movement . During the next 2 or 3 decade that followed , France 's New Wavers caught everyone 's attention , and there wa always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere , making bitter masterpiece . But in 1971 , Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle , geographically speaking , with his miraculous work * Death in Venice * , which might a well be called * The Death of Europoean Cinema * . After the Sixties wound down , so did the great European filmmaker , who , with some exception , generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats ( Coppola , Scorsese , & Co. ) . This movie absolutely feel like a grand summing-up , not just of Visconti 's particular obsession , but of the general attempt of European filmmaker to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movie . And rest assured , you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here . He 's not playing to the crowd , folk : either you get behind him and follow along , or you get left behind . The pacing is a challenge : slow , but never without emotional weight . `` Incidents '' are few and far between , but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos . We will probably never be in such rarefied company again , in term of the movie : one of the century 's great writer who inspired the tale ( Thomas Mann ) , one of the greatest filmmaker directing it ( Visconti ) , one of the greatest actor in the lead role ( Dirk Bogarde ) , and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background , Gustav Mahler 's 5th Symphony . Taking full advantage of Mahler 's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast , Visconti change the main character , Aschenbach , into a decrepit composer from his original persona a a writer , even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler ( geeky mustache , spec , shaggy hair , duck-like walk ) . Bogarde , by the way , delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movie : it 's a largely silent performance , and the actor ha to deliver ream of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse . Cinema just doe n't get better than this . I 'll ignore the complaint from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it 's too slow , but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach 's flashback with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced . The flashback fit neatly within the movie 's thematic concern ( i.e. , which is the better path to aesthetic perfection : passion or discipline ? ) , and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruption serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewer . ( Of course , some viewer will sleep through this movie , anyway . ) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful , dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture ; but this movie is actually about something . And what it 's mostly about is suffering : Romantic ( capital R ) suffering , in particular . As a suffering Romantic himself , Visconti knew whereof he spoke . [ SPOILER . . . I guess ] If for nothing else , see * Death in Venice * for it portentous opening credit . . . and for it unforgettable ending , with Bogarde 's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty , dying head and onto his chalk-white face . Meanwhile , off in the distance , young Tadzio , the object of Bogarde 's dying desire , stand in the ocean and point toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture . The climatic sequence sum up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about : love , lust , beauty , loss , the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life , and cold death in the midst of warm , sunny beauty . * Death in Venice * is a miraculous work of art . [ DVD tip : a with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece * The Damned * , I recommend that you turn the English subtitle ON while watching this movie . It 's ostensibly in English , but the DVD 's sound seems muddy and there 's a lot of Italian spoken during the film , anyway . ]",1
"This is a stereotype plot . A young fighter try to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school . This lead to separation from the fighting school and naturally he find a strange new master to teach him to fight . The fight are not of high standard . They are way too `` simple '' in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult . The fighter ha trained and enters the ring , but doe not do what he trained and get an as kicking . The coach yell do this and do that with no success . And after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly doe what he is told and hit his opponent once . This result in a turning point in the fight , although our hero ha been taking a beating of his life up until that point . Think about the Rocky movie and you 'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really take . The fight are also shot poorly . There final thing that screw this film up is the stupid romance . Cheesy music and awkward moment are not what I call entertainment . These guy really could have made some quality entertainment , but the director wa n't up to the task . Or the other crew in my opinion . Maybe they had a small budget , I do n't know , but what matter in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10 .",0

"It is n't TOO bad , but ultimately it lack the quality that the Australian series ha . The joke are few and far between , the actor are attractive ( they should n't be ) , the film maker think far too much about the cinematography ( it 's supposed to look like a home video ) and it 's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim ... it 's stupid . It 's too normal to be Kath and Kim . Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy , middle-aged woman who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes . There are no `` Look at me Kimmy ! '' joke . The fat friend of Kim is not fat at all and she 's not even slightly stupid . She 's a stereotypical black/Latino chick . It 's just not a stupid or funny a the Australian series . It doe n't compare . Nothing is the same . I admit , this show is pretty funny at time , but it is NOT anything like the Aussie series . I wa looking forward to an American take on a bogan family . They failed . It 's supposed to be REALLY stupid and hilarious , but the actor do n't act stupid ! To me , this is just a typical American TV show . It 's a let down if you want it to be anything like the Aussie show . 2 Stars because it is an OKAY show , just nothing like what it should be .",0
"From the decrepit rank of the already over-saturated 'Hillybilly Horror ' sub-genre come this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred redneck . Sound familiar ? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre . There is absolutely new here . The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés ( deformed hick , a peaceful family turned gun-toting killer when push come to show , the rebellious daughter , the one 'freak ' who 's good at heart , etcetera ... ) , but doe even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time . This is forgettable dreck , but humorously enough lead J.D . Hart once starred in a movie called `` Films that Suck '' earlier in his career , quite an ironic omen indeed . My Grade : D-",0
"As a huge baseball fan , my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears . Dennis Quaid had all of the right move and stance of a major league pitcher . It is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much `` Disney '' for my taste .",1
"This film take you on one family 's impossible journey , and make you feel every step of their odyssey . Beautifully acted and photographed , heartbreakingly real . Its last line , with it wistful hope , is one of the more powerful in memory .",1
"Stupid ! Stupid ! Stupid ! I can not stand Ben stiller anymore . How this man is allowed to still make movie is beyond me . I ca n't understand how this happens if I performed at work the way he act in a movie I 'd get fired and I own the company ..... I would have to fire myself . GOD ! This movie wa just a plain , steaming , stinking pile of POO , that need to be vapoorized if that were possible . Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 line of text in a comment is idiotic . What is wrong with just saying a few thing about a movie ? I will never understand why site will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary .",0
"This show is great for many reason .. The father and mother can communicate with their kid this day in age . Its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family . I watched this one time and became hooked.It so great to see a black family on TV worth watching . This show left too soon but on it way out it dealt with pregnancy , sexy , drug , bad date , death etc .The best thing about the show wa that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way . Great show for the family .. I cant tell you how many time I have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off . Great pg 13 rated show.I loved everybit of this show .",1
"This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped . Though I will concede that the idea behind `` Batman Forever '' were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director , a it turned out this wa not to be the case . Apparently Warner Brothers executive were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out . Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton , and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series , I fail to understand how `` Batman Returns '' can be considered at all disappointing . True , it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repair all the minor deficiency of style found in `` Batman , '' a weaker script that split the antagonism between not just two but three character invite unflattering comparison to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson a the Joker in the first film . Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film , true to the way the Batman wa always meant to be , and highly satisfying . Michael Keaton return a the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne , tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck ( Christopher Walken , named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor ) , his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot , the Penguin ( Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier 's `` Richard III '' ) , and Selina Kyle , the Catwoman ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) , whom Wayne romance both a himself and a the Batman . The four principal turn in excellent performance , especially Walken and DeVito , while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identity . There are some intriguing concept in this film . About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some place , which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight . There simply is n't enough time to properly explore what 's going on . Nevertheless , this is a damn good film . I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first , and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton .",1
"The Quick and the Undead is , finally , the first movie to actually render it own storyline null and void . It is , essentially , one gigantic plot hole . Aside from that , the acting wa quite bad , character motivation nonexistent or unbelievable and there wa n't a single character worth hanging our hat on . The most interesting cast member ( who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist ) got snuffed halfway through the proceeding . What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve a is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing . It looked excellent , when you take into account budget consideration . Unfortunately , it play out like a guy got his hand on a hundred grand and watched a few western ( most notably The Good , The Bad and The Ugly ) and then just threw a bunch of element haphazardly into a movie ... `` you know , they have movie where character do THIS ! Does it fit here ? No , but who care ! They do it in other movie so I should do it here ! '' Maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographer and colorist ( first-year film-schoolers ) . Otherwise , a must-miss .",0
"I wa stunned by this film . Afterwards , I did n't even want to see any film for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison . For many , it may be the worst of Antonioni- very slow , without an engaging conventional story line , microscopic examination of human emotion and interactions- and the worst of Wenders- verbose , confused transcendentalism . It is composed of short distinct episode linked by Wenders ' typical meandering hero 's stream of consciousness , so it doe n't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema . But for fan , the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretch across the film . Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segment that seek out the heart of thing .",1
"Am I the only person who think that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the USA must detest this almighty slap in their face . A rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she ha time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera . By the time he return ( still no senior cop , SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie - this is New York is n't it ? ? ) it ha started raining and she get to work photographing the evidence , only after she 'd stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene . I want to know the name of that camera a the photograph were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the image ! ! The horror continues : - not in the film itself ( pretty ordinary I 'm afraid ) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character a played by Mr Washington . This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with year of experience who , instead of the highly trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners , entrusts the work to an untrained cop , a rookie cop , who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clue and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making DNA profiling well nigh impossible . Now that wa a bright idea eh ? I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable . I have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolie 's lip which are the only item requiring my disbelief to be suspended !",0

"This is the second Hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock film I 've seen in full , the first wa Rope , which I really enjoyed . With Saboteur Hitchcock wa more room to roam free , whereas Rope took place all in one room . I did n't enjoy this one a much a Rope but that 's not saying this is a bad film , it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more . It seems like a film Hitchcock would make a a break in between his more serious one . As a thriller , I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States . The climax of the film feel like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension . The sound design is almost non existent . You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them , but the important thing are missing , the stitch ripping apart from the sleeve , the need of music to amp of the tension , all missing . Intentional no doubt , yet it lack the emotional punch one would want from such a scene . Then it end abruptly leaving you empty inside . The film doe n't feel like it should either , they are almost globe trotting from place to place , yet it feel more confined . The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse way to get the plot moving . The performance are there , but nothing amazing . Everyone play their part to scripted word on the page . The relationship between the two lead is weak and needed more work . The one stand out is Otto Kruger , who ha that rich , ego , evil persona down pat . In the end , I wanted more from this one . I understand it 's one of Hitchcock 's least exciting film , but I did have a good time watching it . I can recommend it , just not enthusiastically .",1
"It is always difficult to bring a 450 page book down to a three hour film . I read the book before , and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible . The quality of the book have n't been lost : the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s , the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up , the characterization of different social group by different way of speaking , the unexpected and surprising twist of the story , the way the film make the spectator look different at the same scene when they are told first from Sue 's point of view then from Maud 's one . The main actor do very good , and especially the growing love between the two woman is convincingly developed , with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other , because they still love each other . For each of her book the author , Sarah Waters , ha thoroughly investigated what life wa like in British 19th century . While in Tipping the Velvet it wa the world of the vaudeville theater and the beginning of social movement , in Affinity the dreadful reality of woman penitentiary and the fashionable evocation of spirit , in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of person supposed or declared disturbed in asylum based on the reading of source and scientific research . This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scene show a high grade of historic truth . I highly recommend this film production because it offer three hour of colorful Victorian atmosphere , vivid emotion , and suspense .",1
"This is one of my all time favorite cheap , corny , vampire B movie . Calvin Klein underwear model ... oh , I mean , Stefan the Good Vampire , return to Transylvania to ascend the throne of Vampiric Royalty , but Manicure-impaired and eternally drooling half brother Radu ha other plan . Having killed their father the Vampire King , Radu now set his sight on Stefan , Stefan 's new mortal girlfriend Michelle and her two pretty friend , and the all-powerful Bloodstone . Okay , the scenery is beautiful , and it should be a it wa shot on location in Transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sake . The actress are no great shake and Stefan the Heroic Vampire is about a charming a a refrigerated fireplace poker , but who care ? There 's only one reason to watch this movie , and his name is RADU ! He 's a physical homage to Nosferatu and he ha the best line in the movie , all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smoke ten pack of cigarette a day . The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scene in the film , a Radu slowly approach the camera and reveals his grinning , slobbering face for the world to see . I found myself cheering him on a he collected victim and taunted his perfect brother . But maybe I 'm just a sicko . Questionable taste in men aside , I highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiast . It 's original , it 's fun , and Radu is one of the best vampire I 've seen in a long time ... much more fun than the stiff , tragic , whining Undead brat that endlessly grace the horror screen these day . Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes . He 's what a vampire should be .",1
"Let me first off say that I am a believer of ghost , and I do indeed know they exist . I have had enough experience with them to know they are there . What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and Religion into all of this . People forget there is more than one `` Bible '' , thousand of religion and belief , and different way to interpret what is said in the Bible . Not everyone belief in God , and not everyone belief in stereo-typical religion . Religion doe not make everything fact , one of the thing I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible thumper is breaking the very rule written within .... you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time , slavery is OK , and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstance . None of this , `` Oh that wa the Old testament , and now we have the New Testament . '' If the Bible is the word of God , and can not be changed .. there should be no change , or version . Religion is full of misinterpretation , mixed fact , and people who so blindly follow it that there , `` Is no other way . '' The excuse these said blind follower use are either pathetic , or they themselves can not explain the discrepancy properly , and instead use excuse handed down to them from either their Pastor or teacher . But anyhow , onto the review . I am a decent fan of `` Ghost Hunters '' and when I heard this show wa coming soon , I wa pretty excited and thought it had some potential . As much a I like watching `` Ghost Hunters '' , I do not like some of their member , and I do not like the way they can dismiss a place a being haunted , yet can not explain anything that is going on . Just because your investigation equipment doe not pick it up , doe not mean the camera filming the show did not . I am glad they are skeptical , but it 's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film doe not make the place haunted or not . If Ghosts were that easy to capture , it would be known a a fact , not a belief . It 's more of a `` right place at the right time '' kind of thing , a well a if there is something there , what make you think it 's going to `` perform '' for you ? This show is kind of silly . It 's usually boring , and there is lot of talk , lot of psychic , yet hardly anything happens . The main guy 's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to , or is basically not needed . Also , the reliance on psychic is too abundant , a I believe VERY few of them are actually gifted . Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in , but most are sometimes hard to believe . I really wanted to like this show , but of the few I have seen I have yet to be terribly impressed .",0
"For a long time , 'The Menagerie ' wa my favorite 'Star Trek ' episode though in recent year it ha been eclipsed by 'City on the Edge of Forever . ' What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie ' wa that it 's more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current Trek storyline . I still think it 's fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode . Though the 'new ' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others ( and u ) to watch the pilot , the idea of Spock being court-martialed is a clever one . You can poke hole in the plot if you want . For instance , given the Talosians ' mind-control ability and Captain Pike 's condition , why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet ? And there are other confusing question about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best to not think too hard about the detail and just enjoy ST 's only two-parter .",1
"Coen Brothers-wannabe from writer-director Paul Chart relies far too much on idea lifted from other ( better ) movie , yet doe manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keep one watching . Robert Forster cut loose a never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist ( ha ha ) who go on a killing spree in the desert . The film is unusual , but in it attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience , it becomes alienating and off-putting ( with a role for Amanda Plummer that is downright humiliating ) . An admittedly bravura finale , many quirky bit of business -- and Forster looking great in the nude -- make this a curiosity item , nothing more . Veteran movie-director Irvin Kershner produced , and maybe should directed a well ( could Paul Chart be a pseudonym ? ) . * 1/2 from * * * *",0
"When it wa released this film caused a sensation . I watched it and wa thrilled . Beautiful , usually young , naked woman filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director Hamiltons photography . His photograph never become porn and the same is true for this movie . Today I saw it again and wa bitterly disappointed . The soft core in extremely slow paced scene , all filmed with some Vaseline on the lens , actually is all there is . There is no real story , the character remain beautiful and beautifully filmed body , but they are not real creature with a soul . Actually nothing happens . It is like Hamilton is photographing using moving picture rather than still . And this get so boring after a while . I even did n't watch the whole thing the second time , for I fell vast asleep . That is all that remains of this masterpiece : it is a very good sleeping pill . And you will never become addicted to it ! Back then 7 out of 10 , now 3 out of 10",0
"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren 's missing sister . Despite it connection to the cannibal movie family , this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona 's `` Guyana - Crime of the Century '' . Lenzi clearly aim to exploit the ( at that time ) topical Jonestown massacre , by depicting a rogue , self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania ( played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov ) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion . With sister in toe , Kerman & Agren attempt to stop the rot , but after several failed coup , they end up fleeing into the `` Green Inferno '' , only to run afoul the local and their notorious appetite . One in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighty , where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with it predecessor , by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion picture . This inferior instalment employ all the motif and gimmick of the others , but with much le success . Was it the so called `` Amazonian native '' who looked like they were Bollywood reject ( this film wa made on location in Sri Lanka ) , or the inept `` decapitation '' and `` castration '' scene that seriously diminished the authenticity that wa apparent in `` Cannibal Holocaust '' ? You can decide . Without spoiling the conclusion , it appeared a though Lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending , where all loose end are resolved . Most unsatisfying . As with the others , where the extent of the graphic depiction of violence toward human is limited ( thankfully ) , the filmmaker have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animal in their pursuit of the most sadistic shock . Unfortunately , the only thing shocking about this film is that it rate a mention among others of the ilk , that deal with the subject matter more convincingly . If there are any redeemable feature at all , Kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man , and his bevy of scantily clad co-star ( Agren , Lai and Senatore ) provide some visual respite from the relentless slaying .",0
"Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid . There is not one funny line or gag in the entire film . This film is so bad it make the Austin Powers film look Shakespearean . A few more film like this and Steve Carell can kiss his career goodbye . As for Anne Hathaway , what is she doing in this film ? She 's a good actress but is just plain terrible . The writing is pathetically lame . There is not one funny , clever , or witty line . There is not one good sight gag . The directing is terrible . Comedy relies on timing . Someone should tell the director that . Every line that is supposed to be funny ( and is n't ) is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing I 've ever seen . 0 star",0
"Herculis Puaro is , in general , a well established 'hero ' we know well from book and movie . This movie or this story do n't work and i felt it not Agatha 's mistake . The cast is n't good , the actor are over exaggerating and making foolish gesture , the costume are so clean and tidy that everything ( even Arab clothes ) look fake and for the serious spectator who think twice this movie can be seen a a comedy instead of mystery drama . The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic . The scene are , a said before , perfect and looking fake . The story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who care about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert ? ! The 'victim ' is not likable .",0
How can so many blundering decision can be made . All that waste of resource ! Its an idiotic story to begin with but there no need to make it worse.A loose interpretation ? Are you kidding ! it diminishes my regard for Voight and Coburn.I hope they were paid well .,0
"This wa by far the worst movie I 've ever seen . And thats compared to Alexander , Fortress 2 and The new world . I should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation a it wa a truly traumatic experience . For the first ten minute i wa changing the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actor seemed to be out of screen . I did n't think it wa possible to make such a bad film in this day and age , i wa wrong . While typing this message , I 've thought of a good reason to buy this movie . A joke present at Xmas . I 'm blaming the Mrs for this one a she picked it , thanks babe . Be warned ....... A true shocker all round ! ! ! ! ! !",0
"If you 've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much ( a I did ) that you just have to see the movie , understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut 's writing - that beyond his story lie Vonnegut himself , and that you ca n't put a human mind on the screen . His whit and humor just can not be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance . I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key question that Vonnegut pose in his book , but those frequent cynical moment of satire found on the page are not found on the screen . Does this mean that the movie miss the mark ? Of course not . In my opinion , the movie succeeds because it doe not try to recreate the experience of reading the book ( this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page ) . It succeeds because it take the fundamental element of a story created by one of America 's true artistic treasure and present it in a a framework without pretense . I 've seen other movie version of Vonnegut book where the director obviously try to channel Vonnegut 's genius and loses grip on his own craft . I would not place this movie a one of the best I 've seen , but it stand on it own leg a one well worth watching . By taking Vonnegut 's `` voice '' out of the movie 's narration or trying to insert it however it can , Mother Night tell his story brilliantly , and preserve the story 's fundamental lesson without confusion , distraction , or disappointment .",1
"This is one of the worst movie , I 've ever seen . Not only , that it is a comedy , which is n't funny , but it 's also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screen and other effect . The two `` hero '' with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot , that they touched each others genitals all the time . But the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal , by referring to German history and to show sensitive aspect of the `` hero '' , which find it climax in showing how Erkan and Stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their `` joyful '' lifestyle ( ! ) . But I had n't expect anything better by director Michael `` Bully '' Herbig , who also made two not funny TV-shows , a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny SF-comedy movie . But Erkan and Stefan had been- just a little- better in some of their stand-up program . For me the only good thing about the movie is Alexandra Neldel , who is very beautiful to me .",0
"I sat through this on TV hoping because of the name in it that it would be worth the time ... but dear Gussie , whoever thought this script wa worth producing ? The basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad , with a constantly illogical sequence of scene , an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face . Looks like a bad B movie from the 40 's ...",0
"A number of contributor have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak . She wa 25 and he wa 50 when this movie wa released . I think that the difference did n't matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo , but it doe matter for a romantic comedy . We can easily understand , that is , why his character would be attracted to hers , but it 's le clear why hers would be attracted to his . Still , the movie work a a light romantic fantasy . The scene where she stare at him across the cat 's head , with her dark painted-on eyebrow flaring and the sound of her humming and the cat purring , is true magic . It 's a little jarring , therefore , when the scene shift to the top of the Flatiron Building , and we see the age difference very sharply . As he embrace her , she reach up to run her finger through his hair , but stop that motion and just brush her fingertip lightly against his toupee .",1
"Family problem abound in real life and that is what this movie is about . Love can hold the member together through out the ordeal and trial and that is what this movie is about . One man , Daddy , ha the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity .

ALL the actor portraying their character did outstanding performance . Yes , I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experience both a a young adult and later a a parent . This true to life is one which every young adult , and parent , would do well to see , although some will not realize it until they too are parent .

"The only conceivable flaw of this film is it 's title ! ! Please stop comparing it to the first ! I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first . If you have n't seen the movie and are curious , TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this . There is nothing alike and ha a mood all it own . This is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy . I seriously doubt such big name in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first . Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus . I maintain , the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of it title . I usually hate movie like these ( i.e . adam sandler , will farrell , farrelly bros .... ) , but this movie just keep me laughing hysterically . I dunno , maybe it 's like a bad relationship I ca n't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure . Either way , this is the single most underrated movie of the 80 behind 'The Stunt Man .

We see them panhandling in a car of the underground , where their pitch to get donation is so lame , no one give them anything ! Salva , who is a hardened petty criminal doe n't even have any redeeming quality , that is , until he discovers a reality show on television that give him the idea of what to do next . Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination , something that Salva capitalizes on . He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that wa critical of the duo . Salva show he is a natural for the reality show .

Espe , who is a no-nonsense woman who is show 's producer , ca n't escape from the way Salva pay her unusual attention . Ultimately , Salva is the victim of his own success in the end . Jordi Molla , whose first directorial job this movie is , had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television . Spain , which wa vulnerable to these type of program , ha seen it share of the bizarre , which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience . The ensemble cast ha some good moment in the film . Mr. Molla , like any actor who decides to direct his first feature , would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera . Candela Pena , a good actress , is one of the best reason for watching the movie . Juan Carlos Villedo , David Gimenez Cacho , Franco Francescoantonio , Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director .",1
"These kinda movie just do n't get the credit they deserve . This is my 2nd all time favorite movie , ( Stand By Me being 1st . ) The reason I watched this movie wa because Wil Wheaton wa in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and I think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did Sean Astin . I just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me . Everything in the movie is very exceptional . The script , the acting , the screenplay . I wa on the edge of my seat 80 % of the time , and if my mom wa n't in the room I would have absolutely balled whenever Joey Trotta ( Wil Wheaton ) died . I did not see that coming ! ! At all ! ! I wa real surprised when I heard that it wa n't real popular back in the 90 's . I wa born a few year after it came out so , of course , I did n't go see it in the theater , but im sure I would have if I would have been alive . If any of my friend watched this , they would be like , `` uhh okay ? '' but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this . If you have n't seen this movie , or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb , this is the movie for you to watch .",1
"As a big-time Prince fan of the last three to four year , I really ca n't believe I 've only just got round to watching `` Purple Rain '' . The brand new 2-disc anniversary Special Edition led me to buy it . Wow , I wa really looking forward to watching it , but I wa n't prepared for just how electric it actually is . Prince 's musical performance throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding - he REALLY ha the move in this one . I am very familiar ( from repeated listens ) with the classic `` Purple Rain '' album and all it song , but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tune and lyric - like COMPUTER BLUE , THE BEAUTIFUL ONES , WHEN DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself . There is something indescribably hypnotising about the scene where Prince and The Revolution perform . The closing song BABY I 'M A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show how much energy and sheer talent Prince wa brimming with in his mid-20s ( he 's overflowing ! ) , it blew me away . It even make Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak year . Prince show you how to win the girl of your dream - drive her to a lake , make her jump in , then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight . Some of the scene are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this add to the film 's overall charm . Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block ( and hilarious ) , and when his group The Time perform THE BIRD you get to see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light up the stage Minneapolis funk style - I love their dancing in this bit , and how Benton provides Morris with a mirror mid-performance . I already ca n't wait to watch it again , I really ca n't ! Extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young Eddie Murphy pre-Beverly Hills Cop admit he is a `` Prince groupie '' .",1
"A good ol ' boy film is almost required to have moonshine , car chase , a storyline that ha a vague resemblance to `` plot '' and at least one very pretty country gal , barefoot with short short and a low top . The pretty gal is here ( dressed in designer jean ) -- but the redneck prerequisite stop there . Jimmy Dean is a natural a a sausage spokesman but a a tough guy former sheriff , he come up way short . Big John is big , but he is n't convincing with the `` bad '' part of his moniker . Bug-eyed Jack Elam is a hoot a always and Bo Hopkins ha been playing this same part for decade ; Ned Beatty also doe his part in a small role ... but there is no STORY . It smell more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film . Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment . Perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is Charlie Daniels singing the theme . You know the one ; it wa made famous by ... Jimmy Dean .",0
"After several extremely well rating to the point of SUPERB , I wa extremely pleased with the film . The film wa dark , moving , the anger , the pain , the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon . I had initially expected to see many special effect , and like a lover 's caress , it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it . Brian , I am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effect . You will go a long way , my friend . I will definitely be the president of your fan club . Eric Etebari , the best actor award , wa the number one choice . You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya . : ) Overall , the acting , story line , the high quality filming and awesome effect , it wa fantastic . I just wish it were longer . I am looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectation .",1
"But it is kinda hilarious , at least if you grew up on Weird Al , like I did . It 's a mockumentary about his life and career , beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origin . It 's uneven in place , but some of the segment are still very funny , particularly when he go to Japan . Although it 's not quite a emotionally textured a Lost in Translation , and he doe n't find love however fleeting , he doe capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is Tokyo street life . Perhaps Weird Al is n't recognized a the insightful cultural commentator that he is ; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just a sweet . Still , this is a funny movie .",1
"One of the two Best Films of the year . A well filmed , well written , well put together film with an outstanding cast . Lau Ching Wan and his friend ( Dayo Wong Chi Wa , Anthony Wong Chau Sun , Francis Ng Chun Yu , Jordan Chan Siu Chun , Cheung Man Tat ) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship show in their performance . Theresa Lee play her comedic role well ( Though much like a female version of Michael Wong , her gag seems to be the foreign born Chinese surrounded by native HKers . ) , and I found myself cheering for innovative explosive scene , something I have n't done since 1. the fan boy took over alt.asian-movies and 2 . John woo 's Hardboiled . Sure the ending wa expected , but I feel better cheering for cop than a bunch of young gang member . Highly enjoyable .",1
I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend . We were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving . It wa very well directed with strong imagery . The visual effect were amazing - especially for a short . It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic : This film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father . There is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard . This lean towards the Gothic feel . I would love to see this a a full feature film . -- Carrie,1
"Why else would he do this to me ? Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movie . Or even decent movie . I saw Lois and Clark , I am aware of just how ... `` good '' Dean Cain is . Obviously this is gon na be a cheesey flick , and each cheesey flick ha it own special way to make you scratch your head . I will not call these spoiler a you ca n't really spoil this movie any more than it already is . To begin with ... why is that a fake helicopter ? I mean ... why ? How come that one scientist is from Chicago and that other scientist is from LA and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried ? How hard would it have been to get either an american actor , or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides u with to say those people are n't american ? Why are there 2 occasion when the movie give u a slug line ? We get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on . And then that 's it , who care about the timeline . To be honest , who cared about it even when they mentioned it , but I guess that 's beside the point . Does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screen ? The answer is no . That dragon sure can walk down that hall .. over .. and over ... and over .... and over ... Who on earth wa responsible for one of the worst ending in film history ? It wa straight out of scooby doo . Oh , the dragon 's dead now ... say , wan na get dinner ? Sure , but not at some Chinese place .... with Dragon in the name ! ! AH HA HA HA ! ! HA HA HA ! !

"Minimal script , minimal character development , minimal steady camera . Maximum stretched scene , maximum headache inducing jerky zoom , maximum character walking around in the wood doing nothing . Up until the time flash on the screen of 12:01pm , you can fast forward and miss nothing , since there are three hunter who we know nothing about doing nothing . To be fair , the movie doe have some string music that wa interesting , so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this .

I have seen this film more that 20 time , To me this is a real desert island film , I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed character that I just love , Jessica Tandy , and Hume Cronin , are simply wonderful , Also Beverly D'angelo , Beau Bridges come in at a close second , do n't get me wrong there are many more great performance 's in this film , and it is also the way it is written that made it for me , and I hope you , a film that you will want to see over and over , I think TV show like `` Northen Exposure '' , and now `` Earl '' owe a lot to this film . but remember it is not a Tom Cruise film .",1
it got switched off before the opening credit had even finished appearing . The first joke wa just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go .

This is one of the more unromantic movie I have ever seen . Casting : Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead role anymore . Diane look a bit eager to please and frowning a usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself . Supporting cast not too memorable . Story : The medical drama he ha to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting . The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about . There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here . The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive . NOT destined to be a great one to remember .,0
"( Only light spoiler in here ) Stealing Sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnapper , dimwit victim , and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time . You will see some poor performance all around in this movie . The drama is forced , and the humor make no sense . Whether you 're watching the kidnapper threaten the victim who wo n't shut up , or a victim 's father responding to the criminal 's death threat with `` Care for some tea ? `` , none of it is believable . This quite comfortably fit into the `` wannabe movie '' category . You will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie . It 's quite unprofessional , and add nothing . It 's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty . However , if you 're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief , you might be entertained by the adequate storyline . I voted 4/10 .",0
"Yes , this is one of THOSE movie , so terrible , so insipid , so trite , that you will not be able to stop laughing . I have watched comedy , good comedy , and laughed le than my wife and I laughed at this movie . The other comment give the idea well enough . The character are so unpleasant you cheer the rat on , the effect are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class wa in charge , the acting -- oh the acting -- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pause . But the rat , yes , the big rat . Why we did n't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me . Often the 'big one ' is n't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effect chew up so much money . I surmise , however , that in this case the big rat wa hidden until the end because the filmmaker were ashamed that the best they had wa a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry . The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene . After figuring out that the rat could n't stand loud noise ( migraine from the bad acting ? ) , the main dude rig up a fire alarm to send the rat into a frenzy . If you 've ever wanting to see a pair of rat waltz while blood squirt out of their head like a geyser , this film is for you . Really , you need to rent it and see for yourself . But not for more than 99¢ , OK ?",0
"Well where do I begin my story ? ? I went to this movie tonight with a few friend not knowing more than the Actors that were in it , and that it wa supposed to be a horror movie . Well I figured out within the first 20 minute , what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie . The Plot wa crap , and so wa the script . The line were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically . The cast could n't have been more plastic looking . Even some of the scene seemed like they should have been made much quicker ... like they dragged on for no particular reason . Very poor editing . All in all this movie wa a giant waste of time and money . Boo .",0
"This is one of my favorite . Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy . One is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year . The other is a playboy who ha tired of gold-digging young woman and seek a relationship with a vital , mature woman . If you 've got silver in your hair and/or romance in your heart , microwave the popcorn , curl up with your honey , and prepare yourself for a treat .",1
"Following directly from where the story left off in part one , the second half which set about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man 's legacy is exactly a such . In direct contrast to the first feature , part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country , to Chestruggling liberator of a country to which he ha no previous tie . The change of setting is n't just aesthetic ; from the autumn and spring grey of the woodland come a change of tone and heart to the feature , replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical , battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle . Yet , a Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly a thata struggle . While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that , Part Two take a much more refined , callous and bleak segment of Che 's life and ambition , and give it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible , easy to grasp manner . While the movie 's tone in some regard doe stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however , there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication a much a possible . This somewhat distant , cold approach to telling Che 's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewer off ; indeed , I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything , the entirety of Che , taken a a whole , delivers a tale that go beyond mere biography and instead document a man 's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way . By no mean doe Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago ( excuse the ironic contrast ) ; Che is a slow moving , reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably- conducted the whole thing . Yet by moving from the lush green landscape of Cuba and retreating to the bleak , decaying backdrop of Bolivia for Part Two , the story doe inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doe n't feel too disjointed from it predecessor , but doe enough to give it it own reference point . Here , the basic structure of Part One is echoed backthere 's the initial struggle , the battle , the fallen comrade and the recruiting of those to replace them , all the while we see some glimpse of the man behind the movement . Yet , a anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know , Part Two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming , and disquieting note . This difference , in combination with the similarity to Part One , make a compelling and memorable whole ; by all mean , both could be digested one their own ( and kudos to Soderbergh for achieving a such ) and enjoyed a they are , but taken a one statement , Che delivers exactly what it set out to achieve . Indeed , everything that made Part One the treat that it wa one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performance from the central cast to the slow building , realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the character on screen is just a vague and indiscernible , but with a feature such a this , Part Two once again prof that avoiding such element do n't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other element to keep the viewer engaged . In fact , upon writing this review I wa at odds a to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One , and title the review a a whole , yet I felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both film consecutively . With that said , I can not rightfully decree whether or not Che hold up to the task of engaging an audience for it sprawling four hour plus runtime , but upon viewing both segment I can at least attest to each part 's ability to do just that . With a reflective , intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performance that do justice to the movie 's character without drawing attention to themselves , Che Part Two is every bit a compelling and rewarding a it predecessor , but this time with a tragic but uplifting , reaffirming conclusion fit for the history page of film . - A review by Jamie Robert Ward ( http : //www.invocus.net )",1
"Sometimes it 's hard to be a pirate ............... but by golly Miss Jean Peters ha a lot of fun trying - and it show , particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard ( Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable ) when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face . With fifty year of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie a some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of woman in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubt that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their head at the time . It wa an exciting , entertaining family film with absolutely no pretension , hidden meaning or alternative agenda.It wa fun . M.Louis Jourdan is both winsome and treacherous a her love interest . Mr Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical a the wise and philosophical doctor.Mr James Robertson Justice is just a tad unbelievable a the bosun . But it is Miss Peters who stay in the memory.Wilfully adolescent , illiterate , tough but vulnerable , wonderfully agile , and ultimately , courageous , she is everybody 's idea of a lady pirate . There wa a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume role - that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret .",1
"I had never seen a film by John Cassavetes up until two year ago , when I first saw THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema , which I found interesting , to put it diplomatically , but not so special , I instantly wanted to see more of his work . Since then , I tried - with an emphasis on tried - watching his other work , SHADOWS in particular . I must admit , it took me a a while before I actually enjoyed the film . At first the unpolished , raw and improvised way Cassavetes it wa shot , put me off somewhat and I thought of it a an original - absolutely - but flawed and dated experiment . But now , upon reviewing , these little imperfection make it look so fresh , even today . Shot on a minimal budget of $ 40,000 with a skeleton six person crew , SHADOWS offer an observation of the tension and life of three sibling in an African-American family in which two of the three sibling , Ben ( Ben Carruthers ) and Lelia ( Lelia Goldoni ) , are light-skinned and able to pas for white . Cassavetes demanded that the actor retain their real name to reflect the actual conflict within the group but saw the film a being concerned with human problem a opposed imply to racial one . Cassavetes shot the film in ten minute take and jagged editing , a reaction against 'seamless ' Hollywood production value . Cassavetes main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style the film wa shot - were the Italian neo-realists whilst also professing admiration for Welles ' pioneering spirit . The use of amateur and improvisation might resemble some of the Italian neo-realist director , but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus an Shafi Hadi , the film feel very different , very American , unlike anything made before really . The song with the feathered girl , `` I feel like a lolly-pop '' ( or something ) feel like light year back to me , ancient history . But no matter how dated it might look , it still make a delightful time capsule of late Fifties New York today . I think it 's this is one of the first film made aspiring filmmaker realize they could shoot an independent film , without Hollywood , improvised and without a real budget . Seymour Cassel , who acted and wa involved in SHADOWS , claim it wa Jules Dassin 's THE NAKED CITY ( 1948 ) that wa the first and inspired them all , but I think this wa the one that really opened the eye of aspiring independent American filmmaker .

"This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullet to make John Woo say , `` Enough already ! '' Of course , it is n't nearly a beautiful a Woo can deliver but it get the exploitive job done in 90 minute . Eric Phillips ( Don Wilson ) is an undercover cop in the near future . When his wife is framed for murdering the Governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg , it is up to Eric to clear her name . Wilson get to pull Van Damme duty a he play the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger . Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me . Being a PM production , there are ton of car chase , exploding car ( 4 in the first 5 minute ! ) and shoot out . I particularly liked the van that flip in midair before it even come close to touching an exploding truck . My other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in Don 's simulator . It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effect circa 1995 .",1
"SHALLOW GRAVE begin with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO . ( I 'm leaning toward rip off . ) After that it get worse and then surprisingly get better , almost to the point of being original . Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story , but the film already surpasses many in the `` Yankee come down South to get killed by a bunch of redneck '' genre because it is actually shot in the South . A group of college girl head to Ft. Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road . ( Note to Yankees : stay on the highway when you go to Florida . ) Sue Ellen ( Lisa Stahl ) ha to pee so she head into the wood . When she finally find a good spot to do her business she witness the local sheriff ( Tony March ) strangle his mistress ( Merry Rozelle ) to death . ( Note to Yankees : do not wander off into the wood when in the South ; not because you might witness a murder , but you may run across a marijuana plantation . ) This is the point where the story , not the movie , actually come close to being good . While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech , his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he ha done and what he must do . Tom Law is likable a Deputy Scott and is a authentic a Southern deputy a I 've seen since Walton Goggins ( Deputy Steve Naish ) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES . A few scene in the movie are worth the mention . The girl stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy check them out . Sue Ellen run into a barn to hide behind some hay bale and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her . And in the strangest scene , Sheriff Dean make like he 's about to rape Patty ( Carol Cadby ) and tell her to take off her clothes . Dean ha turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he 's about to do . The preacher on the radio need to go back and read his Bible . His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ . I feel sorry for this preacher 's flock . Jezebel wa in the Old Testament a few thousand year before Christ wa born and by no mean is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven .",0
"Although this film ha had a lot of praise , I personally found it boring . There are some nice Brasilian sunset and the character are believable , but the story of how they interrelate , even if very unusual by our standard , is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long . The central woman take up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interest of her child first . As the tolerance of the various men is stretched , we see their character develop . The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting . It is a rare glimpse into the Brasilian hinterland , far from the city , but hardly exciting enough to keep one 's eye open for .",0
"No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for `` The House Next Door '' from her 1970s novel of the same title , or someone else did it . This Lifetime-like movie wa directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough . Having read the book a long time ago , we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what wa clearly a movie made for television . You know that when the critical moment precede the commercial , which of course , one ca n't find in this version we watched . The film 's star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sport a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress ha gone through . From the new eyebrow to other part of her body , Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable a Col Kennedy , the character at the center of the mystery . This wa not one of the actress better moment in front of the camera . That go for the rest of the mainly Canadian actor that deserved better . The film ha a feeling of a cross between `` Desperate Houswives '' with `` The Stepford Wives '' and other better known feature , combined with a mild dose of creepiness . The best thing about the movie wa the house which serf a the setting .",0

I ca n't help you ! Not in Iran a this movie is banned there ( see IMDb trivia for this movie ) . Which is a shame , because the movie is great . Would it not be for `` Grbavica '' , this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin . Rightfully so ( it wa the runner-up , or second place if you will ) . Why ? Because it is a movie about oppression . It 's not even that this is a complete woman issue . It is about the government trying to keep the people down .

"I know little or nothing about astronomy , but nevertheless ; I wa , at first , a little sceptical about the plot of this movie . It follows three child that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion , and thus ( naturally ) become ruthless serial killer . The plot doe sound ridiculous at first , but once you realise that a solar eclipse block out Saturn and , a you know , Saturn is the emotion planet , it all fall into place ; make complete sense and it 's then that you know you are n't simply watching another silly 80 's slasher with a pea brain plot . Thank god for that ! Seriously , though , Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise , but it more than make up for that with it 's originality . Having a bunch of kid going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema , but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone - I know what I 'd choose . Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it 's silly plot dug it into is the fact that it 's extremely entertaining . Many slasher become formulaic far too quickly and the audience end up watching simply to see some gore . This film , however , keep itself going with some great creepy performance from the kid ( which harks back to creepy kid classic such a Village of the Damned ) , a constant stream of sick humour and a small , but impressive for the type of film , dose of suspense and tension . One thing that I liked a lot about this movie wa the vast array of weaponry . There 's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer us the same weapon over and over again ( cough Halloween cough ) , but that 's not the case here a Bloody Birthday find room for everything from skipping rope to bow and arrow . There wa n't any room for a chainsaw , which is a huge shame , but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it .",1
"After many , many year I saw again this beautiful love story , thinking about how would I , half a century after , react to a film which made so many girl cry and sigh at that time , when I wa just an male adolescent trying to understand woman 's behavior , in a small city in Brazil . This time , however , what caught my attention in the film wa something very different , namely the insistence with which the physician Dr. Han Suyin ( Jennifer Jones ) make clear to the journalist Mark Elliott ( William Holden ) her special ethically condition a an Eurasian . In fact , she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship , repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a `` occidental way '' , provided that , by doing so , she is not betraying her Chinese side . Its seems to the spectator that Suyin is eagerly making effort to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspect of her culture , for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempt to control them . Therefore , Suyin 's attitude always leave poor Elliott  a determined , brave and extremely practical man  anxious and perplexed , without knowing how much importance to give to her word . For him , whose love for her is plain and simple , the situation is totally clear : if we love each other , let u make a couple and begin immediately a life together . `` Not so fast '' , is what she seems , verbally and non-verbally , to answer him all the time . In fact , Suyin 's Chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism . And , a she go on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two world inside herself , she also frequently signal to him that also a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind , namely the constant `` raid '' on the real world by invisible being from an spiritual or non-physical world . For Suyin is always alerting Elliott about how dangerous is life , not because of any objective and concrete threat ( a would be the perpetuation of the English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion ) , but due to the threat of plenty of cruel and harmful god and other mystical and mythical being over the poor , fearful and vulnerable human being . In fact , it look like a whole bunch of Chinese deity are permanently on the watch to make people 's life totally miserable . Because of that , mother must dress their precious male baby in girl clothes , so that they are not taken away by jealous god ; everyone should always be ready to make loud noise to send the cloud away , in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon ; peasant are advised that they should shout loudly `` The rice is bad ! The rice is bad ! '' to protect their crop from being stolen by deity ; and , in a funeral , it is recommended that the dead 's family be isolated from the other people by curtain , so that the god do n't take advantage of their sorrow and fragility . In other word , Suyin introduces u to a culture in which the supernatural ha a real existence , a if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic god are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal act in anyone 's daily life . As the story take place in Hong Kong in 1949 , it should be clear that China really wa , at that time , almost a semi-feudal society , while the country from which Elliott had come from wa not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that , launched by the USA after the first oil shock in 1973 , took charge of the whole world . Therefore , at least in one aspect , both side of Suyin 's Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today . A lot of History came into being since those old day . As to China , the main fact is that , after several phase of a communist regime , the country finally reached , in the last two decade , the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described a State capitalism . And , what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled Suyin in Hong Kong , in 1949 , and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned Elliott , under that tree on the hill behind the hospital ? It is gone , completely gone ! In brief , if that story took place today , Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her entire family . In fact , both men would now be incomparably closer to one another , in their huge pragmatism , talking business a usual !",1
"First and foremost I would like to say , that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual . Someone that cared about others , appreciated others , found no/barely any judgment against other people , and this film ha ( i think ) changed my life or viewpoint dramatically . When i watched it , I did n't know particularly what it wa about , i knew it wa about some type of forbidden relationship , but other then that I wa clueless , and a I began to see what wa taking place between these two wonderfully depicted character , i wa in shock , disbelief , confusion and surprise . The first time i watched it , i wa blind . Blind to their love , to their intimacy , to their connection , to their pureness a human being , to their relationship . I watched it a second time , because i finally figured out how hypocritical I wa being , saying to myself and others , `` Oh i accept all type of people , and try not to judge them '' while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story , because of my fear I suppose . The second time I watched this film , I opened those eye of mine that had stayed closed the first time , and really looked , not at the type of taboo relationship part that I 'd heard about all my life , but simply at two human being in love . And I loved it , i loved the storyline , i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film , i loved the sharing of feeling , and i loved the strong bond created . It is a really eye opening , beautifully done film that made me cry at time , and I hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually , remember that everyone deserves love , no matter what shape or form it is presented in ....",1
"`` ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ '' ! If IMDb would allow one-word review , that 's what mine would be . This film wa originally intended only for kid and it would seem to be very tough going for adult or older kid to watch the film . The singing , the story , everything is dull and washed out -- just like this public domain print . Like other comedy team film with root in traditional kid story ( such a the awful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND ) , this movie ha limited appeal and just doe n't age well . Now that I think about it , I seriously doubt that many kid nowadays would even find this film enjoyable ! So my advice is DO N'T watch this film . If you MUST watch an Abbott and Costello film , almost any other one of their film ( except for A & C GO TO MARS ) would be an improvement .",0
"Once in a while , a movie will sweep along that stuns you , draw you in , awe you , and , in the end , leaf you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form . This is not it . This is an action movie that lack convincing action . It stink . Rent something else .",0
"Hard to imagine this film is based on a true story , and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart-stirring . Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon , really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character . Watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience . The movie is not so pessimistic a I thought before , the story is kinda bright and intriguing . Christy is not despised by the normal , his life is also colorful and delightful , although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eye . One important factor of Christy 's success is his mother 's support which seems to be more touching , and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role , this fat little middle-aged woman us her all to make Christy 's dream come true . So lucky for Christy ! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent a young Christy , what a performance for a child ! The love story of Christy is very well-done , trustful . Christy want love and nothing can derive him of the right to love , his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole ( surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw , I am deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter series , the loathsome Aunt Petunia , so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind , but anyway , any woman ha her own youth ... ) is paranoiac and offensive , I do have sympathy for him , love is a two-edged sword , happiness and agony are just next to each other . Btw , Jim Sheridan 's work are all good ( IN America , THE BOXER etc . ) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying ' , god know why he chose to direct that crap ! Really a career taint for him , what a pity !",1
"I 'm stunned that the reviewer @ IMDb gave this TV film a a high a rating a they did . It 's an innocuous , sweet , uncomplicated cliché ' of a film that had two big name from the past in it ( both of whom did a decent job ) , but this film reek of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channel . I like a good romance a well a anyone , but a my wife and I were watching this -- and before we saw the rating-we said , `` There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there 's nothing in it to challenge their brain , their faith , their comfort level or their cultural preference . It 's possible to make a good film like that ( and Away from Her is an example ) , but this wa amateur hour . There are some quite good film rated much lower than this one . Truly , another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday film . Watch The Family Stone . It 's mile ahead of this schlock .",0
"Do a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the one film missing from the list you 've seen . One of 4 film Scott made at RKO during his prime ( 1947 ) the others are always easy to get . Liberal , Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorn into Trail Street , the town 's main street , and the sod-busters who feed our belly . It 'll take a strong man like Bat Masterson to step between the two group and bring the town to order . More I wo n't say , except that Scott movie usually have just one pretty girl and this one ha three . RANDOLPH SCOTT always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor , courage , level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing . Fifty year ago parent could send their kid to a Scott movie with confidence they 'd learn positive value . ROBERT RYAN co-star in this film , playing a good guy for a change . In real life , RYAN wa one of the many WORLD WAR II HEROS who starred in America 's movie . How sad what we get these day . George Clooney teach our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bomber , while Steven Spielberg teach there is no moral difference between the Olympic athlete murdered in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorist who killed them . Hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left . I wonder how all this play out in Liberal , Kansas . Liberal , after all , wa not a dirty word 150 year ago when the city wa named .",1
"I went to see this one with much expectation . Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest . Even a child can see the missing logic to character 's behavior . Today 's kid need creative story which would inspire them , which would make them 'daydream ' about the event . That 's precisely what happened with movie like E.T . and Star Wars a decade ago . ( How many kid imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers ? ) Seriously do n't waste your time & money on this one .",0

After the high of darkplace it wa never conceivable that Holness and Adobye would be able to create anything half a good a garth marengi . Yet i think that man to man in it own right is a good a show ( on the good episode ) a darkplace . i cant argue that 2 of the episode really are'nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it . if i had to pick 2 great episode id go for formula4 driver Steve Pising ( pronounced Pissing ) and the great Garth Marengi . to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus a Dean Learner make many inside joke but even if you have'nt seen much Dean id recommend this a some of the rant he launch into are genius ie . His argument with Def Lepord over their name . All in All a great show which just miss full mark because of the couple of le funny episode .,1
I saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO . I had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital . I consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that go on in hospital . The idiot that put it down on production value do n't get the point and probably have never been hospitalized . And never worked in one for sure . Billy Jack ( same era ) wa very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and wa a very good movie with a real social message . I have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site I have found where it get mentioned .,1
"I caught this on television one day when I wa young and loved it . In the 1970 's , there were a bunch of lame comedy that tried too hard to be be funny so it this wa a nice surprise . It 's one of the best comedy of the 1970 's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to Murrary 's excellent comedic performance , which still stand a one of his greatest . This is the film that really got Ivan Reitman noticed a a director . Reitman prof with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy director of all time . While this film is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it 's fun , MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely dreadful . Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS .",1
"The film 's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issue in this country ( U.S. ) . We see relationship all over at the university setting for the film . Befittingly , the obvious of student v.s . teacher is present . But what the film add to it value is it other relationship : male v.s . female , white v.s . black , and the individual v.s . society . But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationship is the individual v.s . himself . I wa amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relation on campus . Most film typically show the injustice of one side while showing the suffering of the other . This film showed the injustice and suffering of both side . It did not attempt to show how either wa right , although I would say the skin head were shown a much crueler and vindictive ( quite obvious towards the end ) . The film also discus sex and rape . It is ironically this injustice that in some way brings the two race together , for a time . Lawrence Fishburne doe an over-the-top performance a the sagacious Profesor Phipps . He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead show the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive . Other star that make this film are Omar Epps , Ice Cube , and Jennifer Connelly . Michael Rapaport give an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . Tyra Banks make her film debut and prof supermodel can act . Higher Learning get it name in showing college a more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . In fact , I would say the film is almost a satire in showing student interaction with each other , rather than some dry book , a the real education at a university . It is a life-learning process , not a textual one . I think you 'll find `` Higher Learning '' is apropos to the important issue at many university and even life in general . 8/10",1
"Is rich , ailing Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean , or is she just overreacting -- or more precisely , overacting -- a usual ? Actually , both are applicable in director Joseph Losey 's wandering , meandering mess called `` Boom '' , appropriately titled since temper in the lush , luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode . Richard Burton climb Taylor 's mountain uninvited ; she dress him in a samurai 's robe complete with saber . Though great-looking in widescreen , the picture is otherwise quite deadly , a failure even Liz 'n Dick-philes should shun ( the star ' collective `` what the hell ! '' attitude to their late-'60s film career reached an ego-mad nadir here ) . Pointless , confused , and maddening , `` Boom '' is a catastrophe -- although screenwriter Tennessee Williams , who adapted his own unsuccessful play `` The Milk Train Does n't Stop Here Anymore '' , wa said to be quite fond of it ! * from * * * *",0
"i ca n't even describe it . it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen ( i 'm being a nice guy when i call it movie ) .Just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.It 's not even scary . It 's revolting when there are great movie that never reach the big screen and then come this ... '' thing '' to trick movie fan . I guess big producer make whatever they want . Just get a big producer , hot chick ( allthough horrible actress ) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so , and you 'll get `` The Nun '' . And I thought Bad Boys 2 wa horrible ! ! ! !",0
"The screenplay is the worst part of this film , a it lurch from one premise to the next , missing all the important bit that would have made a number of different story possible . ( This film is confusing , because the audience doe n't know what the story is . ) I had no problem with the low-production value and the acting wa n't great , but this is telly , so it wa fine . I do n't mind if some scene looked like they were done in one take . But having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary . Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash ? Avoid this at all cost . The prologue in particular wa so poorly written , it needed a voice-over to fill in all the detail that had been left out . The prologue wa rushed , it wa n't clear what wa happening , ie . The Russian Revolution wa reduced to `` Some riot are happening in Petersburg '' , with the next scene being soldier arresting them . I know the basic history of the Revolution , so I could fill in the detail , `` those pesky Communists '' . The prologue is best ignored . This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is . It set up this premise in the asylum . It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film . No . Gone . The film assumes she is who she say she is ( even though there is still no empirical evidence . ) It set up a melodramatic romance , a love so strong , it 'll believe anything she say . Okay , a soppy romance . No , because it make no sense . The love interest seems like a crazed ( and incidentally , sleazy ) lunatic , bursting out in wild gesture . This also doe n't work , because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end . They never got married and she returned to America . The love story collapse . Despite there being plenty of love scene , I wa never convinced of the reason that they were in love . I find rom-com romance more convincing , despite there only being one or two scene which establish that they 've even spent any time with each other . It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she say she is , and she struggle to prove her identity . No , the court case is summed up rather than dealt with . The bizarre voice over come back , again to fill in the detail of a better film . The funniest thing to consider is what really happened . Anna Anderson wa a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy thing together . Throughout her life , she had bout of lunatic behaviour . None of this in the film either . There 's a really annoying character in the asylum who crop up from nowhere and announces herself a a 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Next/'Twelve Monkeys'-type informant . Thankfully , she vanishes , having brought nothing to the story .",0
"Lady and the tramp ii : scamp 's adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movie compared to the sequeals is better .

"Wow , what 's this on the video rental store 's shelf in front of me ? Nothing other than a questionable `` sequel '' to 8MM . It wa n't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie . Basically , from the plot outline verbatim , an American diplomat , David Huxley , and his fiancée , Tish Harrington , venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest , Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute , Risa . The entire story is based around the various character who make up these various sex club and strip joint throughout the city . The mystery is solved when , in the end , Tish find out that the ransom money for the video and ( essentially later on in the story ) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband a the story unfolds til the bitter end . I did n't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all . The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it wa , the fact that David end up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner look like the kinky world of the first film , and the fact that the entire movie ha sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene . Otherwise , it a totally different movie . It made for a lousy love story , even before the end is known , which make the ending more of a possibility because I did n't believe the word coming out of David 's mouth the whole time . But we were warned that he wa a liar about most thing that might get him in trouble . There were ridiculous nude scene in most of the `` shocking '' moment of the film , which were trying to stir emotion in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this `` hellish '' sex debauchery . I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequence when there wa nothing but sex to be shown . Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked woman on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative . David wa no heroic person throughout the film . You could guess he wa the main problem long before the end . The actor who played each role were all new to me , which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting `` respect . '' There were plot hole ( How did David and Richard finally impress Tish 's father by getting the lease they wanted when David wa so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute ? ) There were cheesy technology moment ( like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen ) , and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director wa trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character . The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS , too , because it wa n't even about a last breath . Nobody really dy . But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere ... but that wa a good 10 second long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie . Go rent ( and maybe buy ) the original . It 's one of Joel Schumacher 's better and more original film . It ha everything better about it from this film . I would n't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apple to orange .",0
"Ok , honestly I dont see why everybody think this is so great . Its really not . There were two good thing that came out of this movie 1 . Jack 's performance , he wa very good I can tip my hat for him . 2 . Danny 's performance , he wa good . No other then that it got pretty stupid . And , what wa Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly a the Wendy ? She wa so bad . She looked the same every time she got scared . The problem with this movie wa the ending . I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently . And , the over all movie wa just stupid . The problem with the movie is that the book wa so much better . So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off . 3/10 .",0
"This episode had potential . The basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment ( but a phone that constantly ring ) is somewhat interesting . And when she explores the noise , there is genuine tension and fear . But stupid script writing ruin any promise the episode had . First of all , the woman readily admits to seeing thing that would send most of u running in the other direction ( e.g . `` It 's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind ; '' `` This door ha serious damage to it that wa n't here a minute ago ; '' `` The door opened by itself , without me touching it ; '' etc. ) . Given these supernatural phenomenon , plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room , would n't she take some precaution before entering it ? Maybe she could investigate in the day time . Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else . Or maybe she could TURN ON THE LIGHTS ! ! ! Also , while in the haunted apartment , she decides to make numerous phone call to the operator and get into an argument over who ha the power to disconnect the phone , and then they begin discussing the detail of the suicide . JUST UNPLUG THE PHONE ! The phone company doe n't need to be involved . Walk up to the phone and unplug it . Case closed . Finally , showing the phone scamper across the floor like it 's alive wa just comical . If the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card , he could 've done it in a way that did n't look cartoony . Brave Little Toaster anyone ?",0
"The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of it time . Pam Dixon branch out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospect and make this work of art a must-see . Academy Award winner Brenda Fricker ( Home Alone : Lost in New York , A Time to Kill ) , Ben Johnson ( The Last Picture Show , Red Dawn ) , and Adrien Brody ( The Pianist , The Village ) amplify the atmosphere of the movie , drawing in an anxious audience . However , the dramatic performance are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders ( JFK , The Day After Tomorrow ) . The story is centralized around a foster child , up-and-coming actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( Brick , The Lookout ) . Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance a the longtime friend who never knew his parent . The two do n't have much , but what they do have : Angels ' baseball , and what they are seeking : identity . That 's when 4-time Emmy Nominee Danny Glover ( Lethal Weapon , Predator 2 ) come in to save the day a frustrated Angels Manager , George Knox . In relation , all character in the story seem to have the same mission : search within themselves to find out who they really are . Depressed over the fact that Roger ( JGL ) is separated from his father , he wish to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant . Odds are astronomical , but 3-time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd ( Back to the Future , My Favorite Martian ) come in a the omniscient overseer to work a little magic ( pun ) . Before you know it , Al ( Lloyd ) is sitting with Roger in the stand , snacking on cracker jack , and causing some of baseball 's biggest boner ! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells ' ( DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner ) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear ( nominated in Directors Guild of America ) . He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark , played by Tony Danza ( 4-time Golden Globe nominee , Emmy nominee ) , who in relation to all other cast member is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim . Clark ha been dubbed a wash-up , a once big-name in Cinci , but he ha something to prove to Manager Knox . Spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century . This one is a diamond in the rough , and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace . Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey ( A Time to Kill , We Are Marshall ) for all you lady out there ?",1
I kept watching it because it seemed like the plot wa going somewhere . When it ambiguously got there I wa very disappointed . I 'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence . But maybe I wo n't . Maybe I 'll just imply something will happen . The writer lacked any imagination . This is not even a `` B '' movie - it 's a made for TV `` B '' movie .,0
The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too . It wa extremely funny . Angelena Jolie wa wonderful a Juliet . The parent are hilarious.They are caterer a well a enemies.The kid play the part of Romeo and Juliet in the church play.They fall in love and their parent try to keep them apart . ( Spoiler Ahead . I think ) They sneak off after a party and do it . Surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie . If you do n't like stereotype and the defilement of classic literature do n't watch . If you do n't mind those you will have a blast watching this one .,1
"If somebody want to make a really , REALLY bad movie , `` Wizards of the Lost Kingdom '' really set a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness . Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a baggy white `` furry '' costume that look a if it wa stitched together from discarded piece of carpeting . Work your way slowly , painfully , through more not-so-special effect that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief . Add a garden gnome ( just for the heck of it ) . On second thought , skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half .",0
"A film for mature , educated audience ... I saw `` Random Hearts '' in an advance screening shortly before it North American release . This romantic drama wa quite a treat . I 'm sure this story will not be everyone 's cup of tea , especially considering the film 's darkly downbeat premise . But the pic ha some very uplifting strong point in it favor . All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford ( `` Star Wars , '' `` Raiders of the Lost Ark , '' `` The Fugitive , '' `` Air Force One , '' `` Patriot Games '' ) is at the top of his game a the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer , Dutch . Ford 's very subdued , nuanced performance show quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal . This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbuster . Next year Harrison Ford return to action , first for director Robert Zemeckis ( `` Forrest Gump , '' `` Back To The Future '' ) in his summer 2000 thriller , `` What Lies Beneath , '' and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy 's `` The Sum Of All Fears . '' 'Fears ' will be Harrison Ford 's third outing a CIA operative Jack Ryan . Director Sydney Pollack ( `` Out of Africa , '' `` The Firm , '' `` Tootsie '' ) ha a supporting role in this feature a a political advisor to Scott-Thomas ' congresswoman . It 's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack . Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director , he is also one of the most believable , natural and charming actor around ( see `` Eyes Wide Shut '' a well ) . Kristin Scott-Thomas ( `` The English Patient , '' `` The Horse Whisperer '' ) show that you do n't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy . This is one of her better film , and she give a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that work well opposite Ford 's quiet-man toughness . The subplots work wonderfully , especially the subplot involving Ford 's character 's investigation into police corruption . Look for a chilling & effective turn by `` Heat '' actor , Dennis Haysbert , who play Detective George Beaufort , the obstacle to overcome in Dutch 's investigation into police corruption . The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight . Charles S. Dutton ( whose long overdue for a film leading role ) go to show that he is one of the best character-actors around , and Bonnie Hunt , who I find extremely solid in this production , steal most of her scene with that wonderful , charming smile a Wendy Judd . The technical side of Pollack 's thriller is top notched . From Dave Grusin 's ( Pollack 's `` The Firm '' ) perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score , to Philippe Rousselot ( `` A River Runs Through It '' ) crisp photography , to the sharp editing that keep the film feeling fresh , despite the film 's unfortunate downer premise . I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery , well-paced plot , character-driven story , and romance all rolled into one . This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness . It also feature one of the most surprising , yet poignant , and certain to be controversial ending for a Harrison Ford film in recent time . `` Random Hearts '' is definitely one of the better film of the year .

"For all of the Has-Beens or Never Was 's or for the curious , this film is for you .... Ever played a sport , or wondered what it felt like after the light went down and the crowd left .. this film explores that and more . Robin Williams ( Jack Dundee ) is a small town assistant banker in Taft CA. , whose life ha been plagued , by a miscue in a BIG rival high school football game 13 year ago , when he dropped the pas that would have won over Bakersfield , their Arch-Rival , that take great pleasure in pounding the Taft Rockets , season after season .

"I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brother and Jim Abrahams , back in the early day at Comedy Central . Back in those day ( the 90 's ) their programming consisted of Benny Hill rerun and the original MST3k , complete with bearded host . Capt . Frank Drebin ( played by the stone-faced , dead-pan filibuster , Leslie Nielson ) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonist ( think Dragnet meet Starsky & Hutch the Show ) , boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plot and scenario . This is distilled , 3 time to produce the most pure policeman every made . Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz ( for now . save it for later ) . Frank Drebin is clueless at most time , a terrible driver , a terrible shot , macho yet sensitive and vulnerable . He is a master of the police investigative methodology ( a.k.a - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy ) . This doe not make him a bad cop . Cops get lucky also . Capt Drebin ( notice he 's a Captain here ) ha perfected it . Along with his partner , Nordberg , and the rest of force , perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episode . The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables . Most of the sight gag are a bit dated and silly . The magic never came from the sight gag , however . At it core wa a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activity in the foreground , with crazy thing occurring in the background . The movie can best be described a 90 minute compilation of the best gag from this series . Think of Monty Python 's And Now For Something Completely Different ..... If you liked Airplane 1 & 2 , Naked Gun 1,2,3 , or Top Secret , then you will definitely enjoy this . I always liked the series better than the movie , even though I saw the movie first . Why ? 2 word : No O.J .",1
"A guy desperate for action attempt to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus . She refuse him , but when he run after someone who try to steal her purse they get together anyway . And there it start - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero . It ca n't be a secret that thing between them are going to be problematic . In short , a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film . And IMO , it succeeds at being a nice film . It 's no masterpiece , but it had me in tear from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead character twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is , even with the superhero thing going , believable . So . Thin story , but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time . 7 out of 10 broken heart",1

"The film someone had to make . Waco : The Rules of Engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in Waco , Texas that led to the destruction of the Branch Davidian homestead and the alleged government cover-up . The first thing you need to know about this film : you will see brief but disturbing photo of the victim body . This is not done for shock value , but to illustrate point about the way they died , a if you were present at the coroner 's inquest . The second thing you should know about this film : at two and a quarter hour , it 's pretty ponderous - especially if you already followed the event closely at the time . If you are unaware of any of the event other than what wa reported in the mass medium , or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report , this may be essential viewing . If , on the other hand you want a more concise ( albeit unapologetically one sided ) version of event , you should see `` Waco : The Big Lie '' . In summary , this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event , and is very sobering , but a a work of film-making , could test your patience , especially if you have a short attention span . And it 's at time superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearing and the 60 Minutes report . Perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that cover some of the stranger aspect of this story , such a the bizarre chain of event that led up to the ATF raid or the psychological warfare tactic the FBI used blasting rock music at the sect , and their charismatic leader ( all rock musician themselves ) picking up their instrument and turning their massive amplifier outward to blast their own music right back at them .",1
"What a good movie ! At last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock : illusion of fame . Well-known Rockers are getting old and forgotten , not the music . And with a good sense of humour . Have you ever danced on Bill Haley 's Rock Around the Clock ? Anyway , Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll I have ever seen . Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance . Why ? Because in Still Crazy , people are mature . They have a different point of view about rock , about love and about life . They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much . Beyond the story itself , we see character with their own personality , weakness and dream . Like anyone of u . Spend a good time watching this ( listen to the awesome soundtrack ! ) and finally thinking of your own future . Bye !",1
"Had it with the one who raised you since when you were young ? You just want her gone from your life ? That woman is your mother . You should respect her , you should honor her , whether she 's in sick or well . But that in time , it can be aggravating . Especially when she becomes very overbearing . That 's how Owen ( Danny DeVito ) had to deal with in `` Throw Momma Fron The Train '' . His Momma ( Anne Ramsey , 1929-88 ) , is one of the worst . He trying his best to be a writer , and she is everything but grateful . Calls him a `` clumsy poop '' , a `` larda $ $ '' , and `` fat '' and `` stupid '' . For his friend , Larry Donner ( Billy Crystal ) he ha his own woman problem , his ex-wife . She trying to discredit him . So what did Owen do ? Push her overboard . What doe he do ? Help return the favor , get rid of Mrs . Lift ! In the kitchen scene , I liked it where Owen called Larry , `` Cousin Patty '' . And Momma said , `` You do n't have a Cousin Patty ! '' and Owen shout `` You Lied To Me ! '' and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan . Then come the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill Momma Lift . That is thwarted , and she kick Larry off the train . Well , everything back to normal , the ex-wife life , but Momma kicked the bucket on her own . Maybe she should have seen the error of her domineering way . A fun movie it is , and the cast is great . A classic ! 5 star !",1
"Yes , it is a bit cheesy . But it 's suspenseful and entertaining , and one of my favorite ; there are some excellent actor in the film , and they do a commendable job given the limitation of plot and character . It 's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy ' role ; I thought he wa quite believable -- and rather chilling -- a the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite -- I think he brings his character to life very well ; and Sam Waterston ha been star quality in everything of his I 've watched -- movie or TV . I watch this movie every so often but our tape ( a VHS TV copy I got ) is such poor quality it 's difficult to fully enjoy it . This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD ; maybe it would n't be universally sought after , but I 'm sure there are lot of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version . I 'll keep hoping !",1
"So it is n't an epic , but for people experiencing anything similar ( sibling suicide ) it might be an interesting way of therapy . An imaginative narrative and some fine acting make it time well spent . For some reason , it ha n't really caught on in the audience , something I do believe is a result of the main theme . Why did she commit suicide ? Clearly , this is hardly something that US moviegoer will flock to , had it been an European production it probably would have reached it audience in a much greater extent . It is however , a movie that although the realism tainted by a shimmering romanticized glow , give the viewer a whole hearted impression .",1
"I absolutely loved this film ! I wa hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful . I remember how hard it wa when John wa shot . However , watching the `` Two of Us '' took me back to a happier time when he wa still alive and there wa hope and possibility . I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what `` might have been . '' Aidan Quinn wa adorable a Paul and met the challenge head on . I wa impressed with his accent and mannerism . Jared Harris is also very talented and wa quite believable a John . My favorite part were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which wa so poignant . The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction , both of which I feel are appropriate , given the circumstance .",1
"Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film 's plot detail than I could . What I recall mostly is that it wa just so beautiful , in every sense - emotionally , visually , editorially - just gorgeous . If you like movie that are wonderful to look at , and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant , I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art . On a scale of 1 to 10 , I 'd give it about an 8.75 . The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece . If you are in the mood for a really artistic , very romantic film , then it 's a 10 . I definitely think it 's a must-see , but none of u can be in that mood all the time , so , overall , 8.75 .",1
"Great premise , poor execution . Cast of great actor is watered down into a poorly written , poorly directed , poorly edited , waste of film . Only redeeming quality is the numerous shot of the food . Joan Chen , Mercedes Ruehl , Kyra Sedgwick , and Alfre Woodard should fire their agent .",0
"Have to agree that this movie and it 's talented director do not receive the plaudit they deserve . Here 's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience . The actor gave excellent performance and the plot is excellent . Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actor when they are giving strong performance and therefore sometimes hold them in longer close ups than necessary . Good for the actor I am sure but sometimes a the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot . May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the Film business a one of our foremost digital movie director ,",1
"I had two reason for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday . First of all , I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I wa n't disappointed . She looked gorgeous . Second of all , through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca 's film . On this account , however , I wa sadly disappointed . I found the joke predictable ( apart from a few witty remark on the topic of war ) and the character completely one-dimensional . Also , the action scene were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion , with no sense of drama at all . I kept watching until the end , but I got bored very quickly and just sat there , waiting for the scene with Lollobrigida .",0
"This film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making . The lead actor surprise his audience by not actually acting at all . We have to watch almost two hour of his bland soulless face . The joke are all lame I never laughed once it wa Saturday night there were 5 of u having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room . The film ended and the mood wa ruined so we all went our separate way , ruined the night ! OK so pro and con . Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii , look good on bluray . Cons worst acting ever ; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday . Predictable poor plot . Zero character development . Forced joke which fall flat . Many shot of the guy penis which to be fair act better than him and ha more charisma . May all maker of this film hang their head in shame and hold their flaccid manhood cheap .",0
"This wa my first Gaspar Noe movie I 've watched and I have to say I wa shocked . I do n't mind gore in generally , but this is n't even gore , it 's real butchering . For some of you a couple of scene may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting . Leaving aside these aspect , the main idea revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant . When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given , you ca n't stop and take a minute to think about it . The actor did their job well , representing general mask of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society . The movie is full of metaphor , but I 'll let you figure them out . Do n't watch it if you want to have a lite , relaxing time . I recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema .",1
"I agree with BigAlC - this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural difference and practice before I went to live in Japan for a year in 1993 . Tom Selleck doe a fantastic job here , a always , and the movie is greatly humorous and educational . I 'm a big fan of Tom Selleck 's , and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part , bringing the film to life in a way I ca n't imagine any other actor being able to pull off . This film featured some first-rate Japanese actor , and it wa highly entertaining to watch them a they interacted with Selleck - I can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie - Japan 's an awesome place to go , whether you want to party , sight-see or just try to take everything in .",1
"I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt . Ben Affleck wa hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role . Gandolfini give his typical A performance . The entire cast is funny , the story pretty good and the comic moment awesome . I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I wa so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted . I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy , can identify with loneliness during the holiday and/or putting up with the relative . The best part to this film ( to me anyway ) were the subtle bit of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped . Namely , the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree . Go see it and have a good laugh !",1
"Although I lived in Australia in 1975 , I moved overseas not long after , fed up with constant industrial unrest , the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman ! - and the complacency of so many Australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in country to their north . Consequently I missed The Dismissal , along with many other Australian-made TV drama of the '80s and '90s , such a the superb Janus and Phoenix series , which I have since seen , along with Wildside . To me the filmed story of The Dismissal is fair and , a far a I am aware , accurate . However , a to public `` outrage '' it only show one side of the picture , not how family were riven by the controversy . I know , a my two brother would not speak to me for month afterward . But the commentary is , in my view , very one-sided throughout . The inescapable fact is that , notwithstanding fiery expression of rage from a substantial proportion of the community , the Australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favour of Fraser , a they did again two year later . This apart , a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama .",1
"I may be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States of America , but this man doe it for me . That mustache get me riled up . I remember when I first saw a video of his . That girl he beat wa amazing . The depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade wa a new level of masculinity . It reminds me of the granite sculpture of our Mt . Rushmore . If I could ask him one question , it would be , '' If you were a hot-dog , would you eat yourself ? '' Will Orhan be doing a reunion tour ? Take note from the great like Gordon Lightfoot , true music from the heart never fade away . Vive La John Denver . Gracias my friend , O.F.F.L . ( Orhan Fan For Life )",1
"I never want to see this movie again ! Not only is it dreadfully bad , but I ca n't stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick . Mostly I ca n't stand watching this terrible movie ! Frankly , there is no reason to watch this awful film . The plot is just plain stupid . The actor that surround Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier film ! I warn you do n't watch it , the image will haunt you for a long while to come !",0
"The problem is the role of the character in the film . Man to Man show a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmy and taking them to Scotland and then realising that they are not animal or subhumans but actually equal to himself . The problem is the role of the pygmy in the film - two people who are kidnapped , treated like animal , and yet given such a shallow , stereotypical role within the film ... The kidnapper ( british anthropologist ) end up being the hero of the film because he 'manages ' to relate to the pygmy ... No notion of how the two hostage feel , of their point of view , of their ordeal ... I find it is a shallow film , with a one sided fundamentally racist view ... it never manages to move away from the 'white man ' view",0
"Life Begins - and end - in a typical 1930 's maternity / recovery ward , where we view 48 hour in the life of several high risk pregnant woman , played by Loretta Young , Glenda Farrell , Clara Blandick ( Aunty Em ? ? ? ) , Vivienne Osborne , Dorothy Tree , and Gloria Shea , a they await to give birth . While the film feature plot device which seem far fetched today when maternity ward are much more controlled and restricted , it doe offer u a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 wa like for our grandmother and great-grandmothers . I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving . Oddly enough , the most outstanding performance in this film come from a male cast member , young Eric Linden a Jed Sutton , Grace 's ( Loretta Young ) husband . What an actor ! As a first time father , Jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concern about his wife a they might brush crumb off a cafeteria table . I felt his every concern keenly . I 'd like to see more of this actor 's work . He had a very emotional voice , which wa used to unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind . In that film Eric played the young soldier whose leg wa amputated without anesthesia , who screamed `` Do n't cut ! Do n't cut ! '' a Scarlett fled the hospital in horror . Chilling ! Another great performance is from Aline MacMahon , who play Miss Bowers , the nurse . Her character is a salt of the earth type , the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stay , who break the hospital rule constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession . Loretta Young did another superb acting job here a well , a very authentic and deeply felt performance a Grace . My , she is great in these precodes , I 've really grown to appreciate her more a an actress the last few month . Glenda Farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste ( did n't anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn baby ' health ? ) but her character redeems herself in the end . Also in the cast wa an uncredited Gilbert Roland , silent movie star , a a grieving Italian husband . His screen time wa brief , but notable . Life Begins is a must-see precode , try to catch it sometime on TCM , but remember to bring a few hanky to cry into . 9 out of 10 .",1
"This is a great film . Touching and strong . The direction is without question breathless . Good work to the team . I feel so sorry for Marlene , By the grace of God go you or I",1
"I think the manuscript of this movie wa written on the piece of toilet-paper . No respect whatsoever to many important detail which intrinsically make the movie . For example , the name of some Serbian terrorist ( that I remember ) are Caradan Maldic , Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse . What kind of name are that ? Certainly not Serbian ! By the way , Caradan Maldic ! ! ! What a name , I laughed for day thinking about it . Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic . Secondly , there have never been any case of terrorism done by Serbians . A journalist like the main character ought to have known that . Thirdly , the actor playing Serbian terrorist are not even Serbs nor do they speak Serbo-croatian . All this aside , this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of hole . At time it make no sense whatsoever ! ! !",0
"* Criticism doe mention spoiler * I rarely make user comment , but this is one movie I have no problem slandering . This movie stink , and it mediocre of rating of 6 and a half star is probably too high for such pulp . The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were , despite what it ad claim . This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller . The pace of this movie wa extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minute half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression ( I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie 's character debate Denzel about cutting off a corpse ' hand ) . The movie is not at all scary , but try to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie 's character and Denzel Washington 's . Of course , what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship a seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling , however , even this lack all effectiveness and I wa personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so a to avoid hackneyed giggle between the two . With such a crappy movie , I wa half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- thing that mediocre movie like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off . Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock 's Rear Window ) . The cliche of having the killer explain his motif wa uninspired enough , but the reason wa so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen . Esoterically speaking , I even think the murderer 's intention wa completely lost a Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game ' and get with his pet project , Angelina . If you are a fan of movie with original idea and genuinely dynamic concept ( like I am ) , you will not appreciate this film . If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne ( the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer , the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship , the horrible 'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL ) , see this movie .... but even then it too slow-paced and you 'd be bored .",0
"Possible Spoilers , Perhaps . I must say that `` Cinderella II : Dreams Come True '' is one of the worst movie ever made . First of all , the movie wa made during the height of Disney 's sequel rampage . It wa created around the same time a `` The Little Mermaid II , '' `` The Jungle Book II , '' and `` Peter Pan II , '' all of which were disservice to their original film classic . ( Disney also made `` The Hunchback of Notre Dame II '' and `` Atlantis II , '' but I 'm going to drop that topic because their original movie were never really classic in the first place . '' ) Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney film , and I absolutely adore the original Disney `` Cinderella . '' The sequel to `` Cinderella , '' however , wa a waste of time . The character of Cinderella in the sequel wa so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching . In the original , Cinderella wa kind and loving . The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moment with current-era phrasing like , `` I 'm going to do this banquet my way ! '' Let me also tell you that new Cinderella ( a I have affectionately named her ) say , `` Ewww ! '' That is the anti-Cinderella . I try to find the best in people , but in the sequel , Anastasia , one of the stepsister , is good ! What the heck ? Why ? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family member for poor little Anastasia . My question to the world : did the people at Disney watch the original `` Cinderella '' when making this sequel ? Well , it surely doe n't seem so . If I remember correctly , Anastasia wa just a abusive to Cinderella a Drizella and Lady Tremaine . I am all for redemption and forgiveness , but there wa no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie . In the first one , Anastasia wa evil . In the second one , she is good . One just ca n't leave a story like this . I hope Disney realizes that this movie , among other movie , is shaming Walt Disney 's name . Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone , thing will start shaping up around the House of Mouse .",0
"Hopefully the score ha changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of `` 8 '' s , this movie 's true score . As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King ! Previous to going to see this movie I wa n't that over the top about him but now I 'm banging on the door of Chris Rock 's website begging him to take me on a his protege . This film is truly funny , if you do n't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it 's humour which target all area of society including race ( predictably ) , class division , love , wealth , employment , dream , stand up comedy ... the list go on . There wa one slight disappointment for me however . This wa that in going into this film I did n't realise that it wa actually a remake of `` Heaven Can Wait '' another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty . As such I wa quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had watched on TV a few week ago .. Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different area it cover and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any ... you get the picture . Well to the actual plot of the film . Do n't spoil the experience for yourself ! Do n't read the plot ! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two review on IMDb so far that have raved mad about it , go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time , go and see it because it 's a cinema experience that doe n't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema ticket . Go see it because it is a good movie !",1
"Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stand to inherit a fortune and get mixed up in the affair of bad guy and fall in love with a beautiful female lawyer ( Vargas ) . It look very much like a TV movie , not really exciting . The only reason I bothered to see it wa because Valentina Vargas wa in it . No real surprise here , though it is nice to see Vargas . Great looking Chilenian landscape on display but Malcolm McDowell 's part is very small and doe n't add much to the movie . Michael Ironside play a usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable part . The chase scene are standard fare .",0
"Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome . Otherwise , this is only for hardcore addict of ELIZABETH TAYLOR ( her downward phase ) , and RICHARD BURTON ( his miscasting phase ) . Tennessee Williams wrote `` The Milk Train Does n't Stop Here Anymore '' and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play -- but apparently , he wa the only one . Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money . Whatever , it amount to a hill of bean with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner , exploding at the servant and exchanging bad baby-talk with no le than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears . It 's so campy that among Taylor fan it 's probably considered a `` must see '' kind of thing . But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand , you 're way ahead of me . Sadly , this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously a a film actress , even after winning two Oscars . For Burton , it wa equally disastrous and the critic called it a BOMB . Judge for yourself if you dare .",0
"VIVA LA BAM This `` Jackass '' spin off focus on the ( obviously scripted ) adventure of Bam Margera and his pal ( Johnny Knoxville , Brandon Dicamillo , etc ) . This show , while it ha it fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunt , focus mainly on Bam 's torturing of his parent . I 'm sorry to say this , Bam , but ... you 're in no way a cool a you think you are . This ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny ( and yes , I liked Jackass ) , but also narcissistic beyond belief . The overly stylized intro end with Bam coolly explaining that he 's going to do `` whatever the f * * * '' he want to . How about you do something that is actually funny ? I liked `` Jackass '' for what it wa worth . The camera-work wa horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parent ' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy , dangerous or simply disgusting stunt the pal performed . Not so with `` Viva la Bam '' . We follow our hero around a he play prank on his friend and torture his relative , but never doe it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy . The stunt and prank are mildly entertaining , but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile . `` Viva la Bam '' is a poor spin-off of that doe little good but feed Margera 's already too big ego . I do n't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone .",0
"I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing , he should keep his day job a a journeyman actor . Like many others on here , I do n't know how to categorize this film , it wa n't scary or spooky so ca n't be called a horror , the plot wa so wafer thin it ca n't be a drama , there wa no suspense so it ca n't be a thriller , it just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project . People who liked this film used word , like `` ambiguity '' and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wa n't there . Like the Blair witch , people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it wa terrifying . This movie actually started off well with the family `` meeting '' the local after hitting a deer . It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minute , ( well over half the film ) , nothing happened , the family potted about their holiday home which wa all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining . It wa obvious the local would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly ha no idea how to build suspense in a movie . Finally , when something doe happen , it not even clear how the father wa shot , how he dy , ( the nurse said his liver wa only grazed ) , and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently track down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effect . The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way , the film end all muddled and leaf you very unsatisfied , i would have bailed out with 15 minute to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself . It did n't .",0
"Schlocky '70s horror film ... ya got ta love 'em . In contrast to today 's boring slasher flick , these K-tel special actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula . This is a B movie about the making of a B movie ... that went horribly wrong . Faith Domergue ( This Island Earth ) star a an over-the-hill , B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murder that befell a family in their home . Her boyfriend/director , who look and act like Gordon Jump with an attitude , is filming on location and on a tight schedule . The Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetian chant that they work into the script to add `` realism '' . Unfortunately , `` realism '' is something they could have done without . John Carradine , having long since given up looking for the 17th gland ( The Unearthly ) , now eeks out a humble existence a the caretaker for the estate . He go about his daily work , but always seems to run afoul of the director . The horror build slowly ; a dead cat here , John Carradine entering a grave there , finally culminating in seven , yes seven murder . ( At least there 's truth in advertising . ) It 's just sad that the ghoul did n't understand that there wa a movie being made above him . How wa poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chant would actually work ? Face it , you just ca n't go around tugging on Satan 's coat and expect him to take it lying down . Sterno say perform an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses .",0
"I suppose for 1961 this film wa supposed to be `` cool `` , but looking back now ( 45 year ) it 's charm wa just a silly a it 's entertainment value ! Granted , the special effect do well on T.V . with the Series that started in 1964 , but for the BIG screen ? ? I once had a fish tank that wa equally a exciting ! I must agree about the Octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the Seaview . Obviously not well staged ... or trained ! Overall , it 's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effect and I still do recommend it - for fun laugh sake . This wa probably one of Irwin Allen 's Biggest film and I think he thought a lot of it . Barabara Eden went on to play `` Genie `` on T.V . Micheal Ansara wa her Husband . Now that is a cool part about this film ! I always enjoyed seeing real life Husband and Wife team star in the same movie . Neat !",0
"This is one of the finest film to come out of Hong Kong 's 'New Wave ' that began with Tsui Hark 's `` ZU : Warriors of Magic Mountain '' . Tsui set a tone for the New Wave 's approach to the martial art film that pretty much all the director of the New Wave ( Jackie Chan , Sammo Hung , Wong Jing , Ching Siu Tung , etc . ) accepted from then on a a given ; namely , the approach to such film thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony , if not outright comedy . `` Burning Paradise '' put a stop to all that , and with a vengeance . It 's not that there is n't humor here ; but it is a purely human humor , a with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw . But this is just a human are , not even Buddhist priest can be saint all the time . When irony is at last introduced into the film , it is the nastiest possible , emanating from the 'abbot ' of Red Lotus Temple , who is a study in pure nihilism such a ha never been recorded on film before . He is the very incarnation of Milton 's Satan from `` Paradise Lost '' : `` Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven ! '' And if he ca n't get to Satan 's hell soon enough , he 'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule . That 's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here : It 's not that the Abbot just want to kill people ; he want them to despair , to feel utterly hopeless , to accept his nihilism a all-encompassing reality . Thus there 's a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scene that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself - it ha become all there is to the universe , and the Abbot , claiming mastery of infinite power , is in charge . Of course , fortunately , the film doe n't end there . Though there are loss , the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails . ( If you want to know how , see the film ! ) Yet there is no doubt that , in viewing this film , we visit hell . Hopefully , we do not witness our own afterlives ; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all .",1
"Now I do n't hate cheap movie . I just do n't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad 's camcorder . If I rent a movie , I want it to be a MOVIE , not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV - Tapes . Maybe I hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it wa great , and it wa n't . Maybe I hate it because it 's cheap , ha the dumbest plot EVER , the most unrealistic character EVER and the really , really , really WORST SHOWDOWN in the history of film EVER . Even Tom Savini ca n't save this . Seriously , this one is a complete waste of time .",0
"A fabulous book about a fox and his family who doe what fox do . that being stealing from farm and killing prey . until a trio of farmer decide they 've had enough of this fox and try in various way to have the problem `` solved '' . They are of course `` out foxed '' at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raid against the three farmer land . The '' film '' version , and I use the term film very loosely , is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movie particularly the Oceans movie . They they even have George clooney a Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely . So kudos to them .They 'll make lot of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl child book .",0
"As soon a it hit a screen , it destroys all intelligent life form around ! But on behalf of it producer I must say it doe n't fall into any known movie category , it deserves a brand new denomination of it own ! It 's a `` Neurological drama '' ! It saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person 's brain . It 's the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one . It drive you speechless , all you member go numb , your mouth fall open and remains so , and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf . No small feat for such a sort of a `` movie '' . The only word that come to my mind just having finished my ordeal is OUTRAGE ! ! ! ! ! !",0
"For a film made in Senegal , based , I guess loosely on Carmen , the book , by Prosper Merimee , this film doe n't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that ha been made famous a an opera and a other film . Ms. Gai a the Karmen of the title is very good to look at . Her fiery dancing smolder the screen , a is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film . This is a Karmen that aim to please to all gender , but a real Carmen , she is not ! We would like to see Ms. Gai in other film in which her talent is better used than here .",0
"This is a very noir kind of episode . It begin with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend , the recently divorced Karen Mills ( Pat Delaney -- daughter in law of John Huston , who knew a few thing about noir film ) and her daughter . When they arrive , Karen go in the house while Jim pick up her daughter from the back seat and carry her up to her room . He then discovers Karen ha disappeared without a trace . Of course he call Dennis and when the police arrive , they see no sign of Karen , but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bush . So of course that make Jim an immediate suspect . This is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky asking Jim to go over the story once again . Rocky suggests that by Jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he did n't think wa important at the time , but now might lead to a clue a to what happened . It 's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent . It also go a long way to show that Rocky is n't just some clueless old man either . As he say `` You come to me because I 'm your father . And I 'm smarter than you ! '' This is one of those time where we see where Jim got his smart . This episode also feature an appearance by hottie Lara Parker , who played Angelique in the `` Dark Shadows '' series and went on to play Laura Banner , Bruce 's wife in the `` Incredible Hulk '' series a few year later . She look terrific here . This episode also mark the first mention of the Minette crime family , a name that would keep popping up on the Rockford Files almost whenever they needed a mob family . This time , it Vincent Minette who Rockford help apprehend . Lt. Diehl ( Tom Atkins ) make his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he wa on the earlier season one episode to a police Sargent . I guess they figured it would be better to have Dennis le powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police . Frankly , they were right , though I prefer the later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl . Not a lot of the typical `` Rockford '' humor in this episode , but a good mystery with a lot of heart .",1
"The Royal Rumble ha traditionally been one of my favourite event , and i 've been a wrestling fan for a good few year now . The other show may have better match , but i 've always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement . I 'm not going to reveal the winner of any match a i do n't see it a fair to ruin the result on a review . I will comment on the quality of them though . We have the standard 4 match , and then the big rumble event . Two from Smackdown and two from Raw . Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw . This prof to be a good match from two talented guy . This is a match i 'd recommend watching . It 's hard to sum up without giving away the winner . Next we have the usual Undertaker against some big nasty monster , be whoever it is . Giant Gonzales , Yokozuna , Kamala ... well this time it 's Heidenreich . Its also a casket match . Typical Undertaker fare . Watch if you 're a fan . I have to admit i am , purely for the entertainment factor . It can hardly be regarded a a classic wrestling match . The next two match are the title match . For once Smackdown manages to upstage Raw . Their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable , but with a anti-climax and let down to end it . Raw 's match is a pretty dull and boring affair , which is a pity a i 'm a fan of both guy involved . Now to the main reason i love the event , the rumble . It 's a pretty good one this year . Coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win , and it may not prove a big surprise , but hey , it very enjoyable . There are the usual diverse way of people being eliminated . There is the token guy who doe n't make it to the ring , the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished , and someone get eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant . It ha it usual high and low , and i loved the ending , in particular the Vince McMahon entrance . I 'd recommend this show . Not the WWE on top form , but it still good . Add it to your collection .",1
"I remember this in a similar vein to the Young Ones . We 'd stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend week replaying the line to each other . We called one of our mate `` Zipmole Watkins '' after the brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock ha a bit of 'restyling ' on his nose by the Back Street Abortionist . Lots of great line `` Remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man . Take it easy guy ! '' - Gandhi a a local shopkeeper . Tony woodcock wa definitely on there in the episode they were teaching Ralph ( Daniel Peacock ) to be a barman `` It 's no good Amanda I 'll never make it a a bar man '' Helen Lederer teach him to ask people about the match `` See the match last night ? I thought Woodcock played well '' After a string of failed conversation the curly haired Arsenal star wa sitting at the bar : `` See the match last night ? '' `` Yeah . I thought I played well '' We still do odd stupid line now - `` Reg and Ralph ..... or ....... Ralph and Reg . Reg , Reg ... Reg Reg Reg Reg '' Lots of very surreal silly moment and very surreal song from the Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line - `` And he 'll mark your package 'Return To Sender '' Good old Danny Peacock - you added a lot to some young drinker ' evening sir . * * Update - I found a couple of episode on tape - I 'm going to upload the Gandhi sketch to Youtube * *",1
"Destined to be a classic before it wa even conceptualized . This game deserves all the recognition it deserves . At a time when first-person shooter like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers , graphic adventure are a dying breed .

Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island . * prediction * the sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic too . I guarantee it .",1
"Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community towards the end of the last century . Two beautiful and musically talented sister give-up their own prospect of happiness and marriage in order to look-after their ageing father . One day , a French woman , Babette , come to work for them . After some year she win the lottery and is determined to do something for the sister who have taken her in . Her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast , which change the life of all those invited . This is a film about human and cultural interaction , reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from Danish to French , and especially between the dutiful sobriety of Protestant northern Europe and the sensuousness of the Catholic south . It is also about human need , and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the sens . A profoundly uplifting film .",1
"This movie wa way over-hyped . A lot of the viewer , who thought this wa `` amazing '' must have been into the old school movie , cause the whole movie is set in the past . At first I thought the movie wa just showing something from the past , so I wa expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the character to pas , but it just going . Basically this wa a movie trying to mix the future with the past , and the 2 do n't mix very well in this movie , even with special effect . You could actually see the blue screen the actor were working with . There are too many movie out there that do exactly what this movie did , so there is no reason for critic to hype this movie up saying `` it 's the greatest movie ever done '' . It 's just crap on a stick . It also did n't help that the story line wa sooo crappy . I do n't understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced , and I also do n't understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this . It 's almost a though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... '' It will all be done on a computer '' . This wa a movie that should have been on a movie network , because nothing about this movie wa revolutionary . I 'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this . Whatever you do , do n't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow .",0
"It is incredible that there were two film with the same story released in 2005 . This one came out a day before that other one with Tom Cruise . Did n't they do that with Truman Capote the same year , and the Zodiac killer last year ? Interesting . Writer/Director David Michael Latt did n't have Steven Spielberg 's budget and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise . This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $ 588 million worldwide . The action wa minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of Rhett Giles , who played a pastor that wa giving up on his god . Gary Busey wa creepy a an army LT .",0
"I dunno sometimes ... you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the B thru Z grade movie out there , but once in a while a particular movie just test your patience until you want to slap everyone involved . `` Bat People '' ( which I saw under the title `` It Lives By Night '' ) is just such a movie . You ca n't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on `` Night Gallery '' , and not one of the better one , either . The movie ha something to do with a doctor who get bitten by a bat and consequently start to morph into a Were-Bat who drink human blood . ( Actually , you 'd think if he wa turning into a real bat , he 'd be eating mosquito by the gallon bucket , but because this is a cheap , lurid horror movie , blood 's the word . ) In spite of the fact that he ha grand-mal seizure at the drop of a hat , and black-out episode almost every night , his friend and fellow physician , Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme , insists that he 's just having an 'allergic reaction ' to the rabies shot . Meanwhile , the world 's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspect the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girl ( and one wino ) . Also meanwhile , the doctor 's wife decides that denial IS a river in Egypt and alternately patronizes him and nag him to distraction . It 's not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actor are making professional level choice , and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script , even the guy who play the sheriff . ( Okay , it IS pretty bad , but it 's bad in a clichéd , wooden , professional way ) . It 's just that everything about the acting , the way the scene are paced , the costume , the dialog , the script and the story line in general set your teeth on edge and make you want to , well , slap everyone involved . I think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky , unsettling little cult favorite , BUT : 1 ) The director needed to beat Michael Pataki , an experienced character actor , with a chair until Pataki agreed to ACT , and not just channel Dennis Weaver . 2 ) He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole `` Bat Bites Human , Who Then Turns Into A Bat '' scenario . 3 ) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his 'episodes ' , instead of resorting to `` Man Has A Seizure '' page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms . 4 ) He needed to rework the whole 'wife ' character , make her both more intelligent , le shrill and waaaaay more observant . I would never voluntarily watch this film again , except with the help of Mike and the Bots . It 's bad , but it is n't bad in a silly , humorous or interesting way . Still better than `` Battlefield Earth '' or `` Waterworld '' , though .",0
"Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing , great production , and an emphasis on clever idea over adolescent pap . The two star work great together , and -- what can I say ? Amanda Bynes shine . Putting `` Irkel '' and Lee Majors in the film were brilliant touch . Watch this film with your kid . If you do n't laugh throughout it , you must not have been paying attention .",1
"Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actor I have appreciated throughout their career , and that wa the only reason for choosing to watch this movie . Well , all I can say is I totally regretted it ! These two great actor humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant , unimaginative and kitch to the extreme ( not that this is bad on it own ) sketch that are supposed to make people laugh , but fail to do so . The only reason I can think is that the director wa their friend , and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-I ca n't think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap ! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack have n't disappointed me ever since . I would recommend you to avoid this film , unless you want your opinion about the two actor spoiled .",0
"On watching this film , I wa amazed at how medium perception can mould a person opinion of a celebrity . Karen Carpenter wa a carefree , but very unconfident young lady , whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the chart with wonderful song . As with all celebrity of today , they were often criticised about their music a well a their look , style , etc . THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight , which eventually caused her death . This heart felt film wa not initially something which I would have thought of watching . But on starting to view it , then I wa hooked . In the same way that the Tina Turner story doe , then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performer life . The acting wa superb and even after nearly 20 year after it wa made , then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining . I would recommend this to anyone who ha n't yet watched it . It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged .",1
"Nothing is sacred . Just ask Ernie Fosselius . These day , everybody ha a video camera , and a movie is hardly out before the spoof start flying , quickly written and shot , and often posted directly to the internet . Spoofs are hot these day , and we go out of our way to make sure filmmaker do n't get off on their own self-importance . 25 year ago , when the first Star Wars wa made , it wa a different world . Filmmaking wa the playground of a select few and spoof were very rare . Then God gave u Hardware Wars . It wa shot to look cheap ( or wa it just cheap ? ) and the audio wa obviously recorded after the fact . Does that take away from the experience ? HECK NO ! That 's what make it so great ! It wa raw and unpolished , and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moment of the original movie . From Fluke Starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber ( I did that when I wa young ! ) to Chewchilla the Wookie Monster , to Auggie Ben Doggie 's `` nah , just a little headache '' remark , this film short is a much a part of the phenomenon a any of the actual Star Wars film . Rent it . Buy it . Borrow it from a friend . And may the Farce be with you . Always .",1
"I hated it . I hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerade a art . This film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid . After the first half hour , I fastfowarded through the DVD version , and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over . I became angered that I had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap . Tinting drivel in sepia or blue doe not make something a movie , let alone art .",0
"I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movie , but my GOD ! ! ! This wa THE worst movie I have ever seen . Bad acting , bad effect , bad script , bad everything ! The plot follows a group of teen cliche 's on their way to a rave ( that take place in broad daylight ) at a remote island . However , when the group arrives , all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes . Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers , the clan set 's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest . During this crusade , they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapon to give to each of the kid . They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivor . Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequence including a far too long shootout outside of the `` house of the dead . '' This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence , redundant clip from the HOTD video game , and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotation . One of the character 's even volunteer to sacrifice himself to save the others . Why ? Not because he wa noble and brave , but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled ! I 'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? ! ? To sum it all up , there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is . The theater I wa in wa more dead than the zombie on the screen , and I 'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh * t could easily cover the cost it took to make it . GRADE : F",0
"If you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school , try to convince your teacher to see something else . believe me , anything is better than this movie . it is slow paced , confusing , boring , poorly constructed , gory , gringy , do I need to go on ? It 's message is good , but I have seen them been handled better in several other film . The acting is n't even any good . This movie is just even more awkward , a it start off a being funny ( not intensional though ) because of it 's surreal story , than at the end , just becomes uncomfortable to watch . I honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minute of my life ha been robbed . Why would anyone want to watch a girl describe a threesome for 10 minute , than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minute , listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear , witness a sort of rape , than see the female lead role eat her husband . Honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10 . And if your not happy with my preview , seriously I 'm an open minded guy and I like movie that protest through symbolism , but this movie wa just awful . make any excuse you can , to avoid this film .",0
"This is like a zoology textbook , given that it depiction of animal is so accurate . However , here are a few detail that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film : - Handgun bullet never hit giant Komodo dragon . It doe n't matter how many time you shoot at the Komodo , bullet just wo n't go near it . - The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant Cobra , or a giant Komodo dragon , is just to stand there . The exception to this rule is if you 've been told to stay very still , in which case you should run off , until the Komodo is right next to you , and then you should stand there , expecting defeat . - Minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credit really make for enjoyable watching . - $ 5,000 is a memory enhancement tool , and an ample substitute for losing your boating license/getting arrested . - Members of elite army unit do n't see giant Komodo dragon coming until they are within one metre of the over-sized being . Maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragon ha something to do with it . - When filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing , a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need ; sound gear , a second camera , microphone etc are all superfluous . - When you hear a loud animal scream , and one person ha a gun , he should take it out and point it at the nearest person . - When you take a gun out , the sound of the safety being taken off will be made , even if your finger is nowhere near the safety - Reporters agree to go half-way around the world in order to expose something - without having the faintest idea what they 're exposing . Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism . - Handguns hold at least 52 bullet in one clip , and then more than that in the next clip . Despite that , those with gun claim that they will need more ammo . - Expensive camera ( also , remember that the reporter only ha one camera ) are regularly left behind without even a moment 's hesitation or regret . These camera amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves . - The blonde girl really is the stupid one . - The same girl that say not to go into a house because a Komodo dragon can easily run right through it , thus making it unsafe , take a team into a building made of the same material for protection - and nobody say a word about it . - High-tech facility look like simple office with high school chemistry set . - Genetically-modified snake grow from normal size to 100 foot long in a matter of a day , but do n't grow at all in the week either side . - The military routinely destroys entire island when people do n't meet contact deadline . - Men with gun do n't necessarily change the direction they 're shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them . Instead , they just keep shooting into the air . - The better looking you are , the greater your chance of surviving giant creature . - Women 's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of mind . - Any time you 're being hunted by giant creature is a great time to hit on girl half your age . - Animal noise are an appropriate masking noise for 'swearing ' at the same volume . - Old Israeli and Russian plane are regularly used by the US Military .",0
"This movie is awful , I ca n't even be bothered to write a review on this garbage ! All i will say it is one of the most boring film I 've ever seen . And the acting is very bad . The boy who play the main character really annoys me , he 's got the same expression on his face through out the movie . I just want to slap him ! Basically 80 % of the movie is slow motion shot of skateboarder , weird music , and utter sh * t .. Apparently I 've got to write at least 10 line of text to submit this comment , so I 'll use up a few more line by saying the lead character ha got one of those face you just want to slap !

"Why do movie maker always go against the author 's work ? I mean , yes , thing have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest , but look at Anne of Green Gables .

Paul Irving , little Elizabeth , the widow , Windy Poplars . . . and Anne 's college year , for heaven 's sake ! ! ! Would n't it have been delightful to meet Priscilla and all the rest of the Redmond gang ?

"I ca n't believe that those praising this movie herein are n't thinking of some other film . I wa prepared for the possibility that this would be awful , but the script ( or lack thereof ) make for a film that 's also pointless . On the plus side , the general level of craft on the part of the actor and technical crew is quite competent , but when you 've got a sow 's ear to work with you ca n't make a silk purse . Ben G fan should stick with just about any other movie he 's been in . Dorothy S fan should stick to Galaxina . Peter B fan should stick to Last Picture Show and Target . Fans of cheap laugh at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B 's amazingly awful book , Killing of the Unicorn .",0
"This film really used it location well with some amazing shot , dark and disturbing the film move very slowly , but constantly keep you watching . Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audience a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected . Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie character and story line we have seen done to death over the year . This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after it screening . The performance and character are well developed , and the cinematography is fantastic . An interesting exploration into family relationship , and environment .",1
"Strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in Denmark , so I had to wait for the video release . My expectation where high but they where in no way disappointed . As always with Ang Lee there is fantastic acting , an intelligent and thrilling plot that ha you guessing right till the end and superb filming . Along with Unforgiven this is easily one of the two best western of the 90 ` s . People who expect something along the line of Mel Gibson in The Patriot ( corny ) or Braveheart ( acceptable ) will be sourly disappointed , all others who appreciate the above mentioned quality will have a fantastic time watching it . 9 out of 10 .",1
"This film is so bad - dialogue , story , actor and actress - everything ! - that it 's hard to imagine that we 'll see a worse movie this year or in the following year . `` Love 's Brother '' ( set in Australia among Italian immigrant ) ha nothing but shallow clichés about Italian culture to offer , and it is quite telling that even the Italians from and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film . The message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people , beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting . Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in film like 'Suburbia ' or 'Lost in Translation ' , but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear . See this film at your own risk . Trash a trash can !",0
"I do n't leave IMDb comment about film but this .... this film wa bad . very bad . I fast forwarded through most of it , stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene , only to continue with the fast forward . Formula plot -- once the obvious murderer were discounted , there wa only the one left . And that wa in the first five minute . Scene by scene it felt a though I 'd already read the script before because there were no surprise , no mystery . The Tori character ... bad bad acting . A true waste of time on DVD and a definite 'let 's go to bed early ' option if it 's the only thing on television . If you watch this film , you will find yourself realising you 'll never be able to get back the time you 've just wasted .",0
"In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the youngest son of his mother , who had uninterruptedly cried for five year . When he is a young man , he fall in love for Karina ( Mariana Ximenes ) , a seventeen year old teenager that dream to see the world and becomes an actress . Antônio promise Karina to bring the world to Nordestina , and once in Rio de Janeiro , he participates of a sensationalist television show and promise to travel to the fifty year ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented . Fifty year later , Antônio ( Paulo Autran ) try to fix what wa wrong in his travel . `` A Máquina '' is one of the best Brazilian movie I have recently seen . The refreshing and original story is a poetic and magic fable of love that will certainly thrill the most skeptical and tough viewer , in a unique romance . The direction is excellent ; the screenplay is awesome ; the cinematography and color are magnificent ; the cast leaded by Gustavo Falcão , the icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic , with marvelous line ; the soundtrack ha some beautiful Brazilian song highlighting Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha 's `` Dia Branco '' . If this movie is distributed overseas , please thrust me and rent it or buy the DVD because I bet you will love the story that will bring you into tear . My vote is nine . Title ( Brazil ) : `` A Máquina  O Combustível é o Amor '' ( `` The Machine  The Fuel is Love '' )",1
"`` I like cheap perfume better ; it doe n't last a long ... '' - Ralph Meeker 's convict character ( Lawson ) tell this to Barbara Stanwyck 's Helen character , after he get a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w/her husband in Tijuana ... ! This line cracked me up , and also seemed like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive , because a cheap perfume-loving man who ha a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run ! I agree with some of the other comment posted about Helen 's attraction to Lawson . Even though her narration state that she want Lawson to be put away , she did seem attracted to his fiery nature , and that passion he stirred up in her would n't likely wash away with the tide !",1
"I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart , and I just knew that I had to see this movie , even though I ca n't say I 'm a soccer fan . But watching this just filled my heart with joy , and I had a great time in the movie watching it . Bjørn Fast Nagell doe a tremendous job directing this movie , and even though you notice the main character are new at acting , they grow with the movie and make it what it is . Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie , there is surprisingly little soccer in it . The whole idea is to show the six guy making up the word N O R W A Y on their trip to the World Cup in soccer playing in Germany this year . If you 're only gon na see one Norwegian movie this year , this is the one ..",1
"Based on the best-selling novel `` The Dismissal '' , The Missing Star , the latest film by acclaimed Italian director Gianni Amelio , is the story of the growing friendship between an older Italian maintenance man and a young interpreter he hire in Shanghai to be his guide through China . Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the Maintenance Manager at a steel mill in Italy that ha been shut down and the blast furnace sold to China . When Vincenzo ( Sergio Castellitto ) discovers that a control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous , he travel to China to find the steel mill where the part ha been sold in hope of preventing a fatal accident . The film , of course , is about the journey not the destination to use a familiar cliché and , on that journey , we are privy to an engaging look at China with all it immense beauty and complexity , via the outstanding cinematography by Luca Bigazzi . The film take u to Shanghai , Wuhan , Chongquing , Baotou , and a trip along the Yangstze River showing u coastal area that are scheduled to be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully operative , a Chinese mega-project that ha resulted in the displacement of 1.2 million people . The trip brings the traveler face to face with poverty , overcrowded housing , and child left to fend for themselves . The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Hua ( Tai Ling ) who first meet in Italy where his impatience with her translation at a dinner meeting cause her to lose her job . When he track her down in Shanghai she is working at a library and resistant to Vincenzo 's approach . Looking at his offer to help him in his travel in China a little more than a well paying job , she reluctantly agrees to accompany him . Their relationship , however , grows a they move from city to city , her interpretive skill much in evidence to help the bewildered Vincenzo who doe not own a cell phone . As they slowly open up to each other , they expose each other 's vulnerability and the film delf into their past and present life and how they arrived at their present situation . We meet Liu 's son ( Lin Wang ) at the home of her grandmother . In China 's one child policy , he is one of the unwanted child who have been `` hidden '' since the father of the boy abandoned the family . Although the meeting between Vincenzo and the boy is casual , their relationship becomes central to how the story play out . Castellitto is an excellent actor ( though one longs for a younger Enrico Lo Verso in this role ) . However , he is emotionally distant throughout the film , his expression rarely changing from a far away hangdog expression . Though Tai Ling brings a great deal of presence to the role , her relationship with the much older Vincenzo never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known a the movie . Though Amelio is one of my favorite director , coming on the heel of the brilliant Keys to the House , Missing Star is a disappointment .",1
This is sad this movie is the top this should at least be in the top 250 movie here . This is still the best Action movie ever done . The action movie of today are badly done The actor and action director do not no how to do it fighting and stunt properly . only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan . The stunt are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the like of ever . The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing . The end fight stunt are for me the best fight stunt ever put to film . The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie wa badly hurt .,1
"I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minute of the film . I managed to stomach 45-50 minute before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead ( which , by the way , is great fun ) . The story ha massive hole in it . The plot line is hugely over stated and dull , the acting is awful , especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at ( looking daft and singing like a castrato ) . Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable , especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet . Freeman and Timberlake 's character seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sort or something , which simply is n't evident at all apart from the fact that ; though Freeman 's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake , he never the le pull out all the stop to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up . It would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line , which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion . Do n't watch this film , it is a pure waste of time .",0
"This movie is a real low budget production , yet I will not say anything more on that a it already ha been covered . I give this movie a low rating for the story alone , but I met the director the night I saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie . He asked me how I enjoyed it and I told him that it wa not easy to like . My main objection wa the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main character , I wa never convinced that they were close . I also told him that the scene where the main character were presented a child becoming friend wa too late in the film . He told me that the flashback scene were not in the original script . That they were added because he felt like I did that the two main character did not appear close . He went on to explain that these scene were not filmed to his satisfaction a they were out of money . I agree that they did not do much for the film . Another fact about the movie , that I wa not aware of , is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience . This is usually a bad move a some writer do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer . The story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption a to the audience 's reaction to his own tragedy . And the story is tragic . However , it did not work for me a I never cared for any of the character , least of all the lead . What wa presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any mean , regardless who get hurt . When Ms. Young 's character decides to give up he evil way , it appears that she doe so because she is ineffective , not because she know she is doing wrong . If the movie ha a message then I suspect that only the writer is aware of it .",0
"I watch this movie without big expectation , I think everyone should do . It 's a great Tv-serie and of course we could n't compare it with Gone With the wind , but it 's still nice to watch . It 's also weird to see a different Scarlett . Joanne Whalley do n't play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh , but I believe that Scarlett is changed when she became older . Do n't expect to much of this just watch but do n't watch like : I think this would be horrible .",1
"What a fun filled , sexy movie ! They certainly do n't make them like this anymore . 4 sexy au pair arrive in London and have all sort of sexual misadventure . The tone is oddly innocent , a the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situation , rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the character . It is only when the actress accidentally lose their clothes that the male character become rampant . Richard O ' Sullivan literally get 'Randi ' ( sic ) . The film certainly betrays the origin of the softcore feature a lying in the nudie cuties and naturism film of the old school . My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls ' is that I am a huge fan of Gabrielle Drake . If any actress ha ever looked better naked ( she 's slim but wonderfully curvy ) , or clothed , come to that ( I 've loved her since the original run of UFO - who else could carry off a purple wig ! ) , I 'll eat my hat .",1
"Jackass Number Two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006 , beating the also hilarious Clerks II . It is one of the best sequel in recent memory , beating Jackass The Movie in every way . Now , this film may be the funniest , but it is also the most offensive , appalling , and utterly disgusting . You will find yourself feeling sick several time throughout the film . I 'm completely serious when I say do n't eat anything before watching or during this film , because chance are that it will literally come back to haunt you . Keep the drinking to a minimum a well . You 've been warned , because , just like the tagline say , it will make you beg for mercy . Jackass Number Two follows the crazy men from the hit show Jackass , Johnny Knoxville , Bam Margera , Ryan Dunn , Steve-O , Chris 'Party Boy ' Pontius , Preston Lacy , Ehren McGhehey , Dave England , Brandon DiCamillo , and Jason 'Wee Man ' Acuna ( Chris 'Raab Himself ' Raab is absent ) a they perform the most outrageous , life-threatening , and revolting stunt imaginable . I 'm not going to tell what the stunt are , but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening , and that one cast member ( once again , not telling ) will flirt with death several time in the film . What make Jackass Number Two so entertaining is not the stunt themselves , but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them . To put it simple , if they loved doing it and had a blast , you will too ( this go for 99 % of the stunt ) . All the stunt are very original , and 90 % of them are never-before-seen . You will witness a few recycled one , but they 're amped up . You would n't think directing really factor into a movie like this , but it doe ; Jeff Tremaine 's direction make the movie so much funnier , because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing , which is simply brilliant on his part . He could have just sat back and slept throughout filming ( actually , you 'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming ) , but he went out there and helped these crazy guy make the stunt a funny a he could . I give Mr. Tremaine two thumb up for that . Another great thing about Jackass is it bonanza of celebrity cameo , and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman , skateboard god Tony Hawk , director/actor Jay Chandrasekhar ( Super Troopers & Beerfest ) , actor Luke Wilson , Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor , and director/actor Mike Judge ( Office Space ) . The scene with Hoffman , Taylor , and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film , a it 's even funnier to see these men a a part of the film . Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect , morally degrading , and just plain wrong movie of all time , if not the most . Despite this , it is so original and so hilarious that you wo n't care about that . You 'll be gasping for air , laughing so hard you 'll be cry , and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film . Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film , no one under 18 should watch this film . You 've been warned . I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two a much a I did . 10/10 -- spy",1
"Turn your back away or you 're gon na get in big trouble out of MY BOYFRIEND 'S BACK ! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you 're watching this . It 's safe to say that the entire movie fall apart , with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie show that defy nonsense to the max . We get a name like `` Johnny '' every so often , and this `` Johnny '' ha nowhere to go . There is n't a specific reason to why our `` dead corpse '' crawl out of his grave just to survive until prom night , so that render the movie totally useless . Without a feeling of sorrow , his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he 's dead . Johnny take a bite out of Eddie 's arm afterwards . The viewer is asked a tough question : Why doe the movie have to be this cornball ? There is an answer . Any resemblance to all person living or dead is purely coincidental . `` Living '' is a coincidence . `` Dead '' ha nothing in common with the movie . Show this one to your girlfriend and she 'll skip the senior prom , turning your life into a deserted ruin . Blah ! ! !",0
"I remember the event of this movie , the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968 , in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race . I wa a 13 year old , living in England . The previous year Francis Chichester ( later Sir Francis ; he wa knighted for his exploit ) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe . I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return ( on a grainy black and white TV ! ) and then his knighting by the Queen . It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK . It all seems so quaint now . Chichester became a national hero , but he had stopped half way , in Australia , to re-fit his yacht , so the next logical step for yachtsman wa to attempt the journey without stopping . It 's important to remember that this wa a world pre-GPS , when communication on land were still pretty erratic , never mind in the middle of the ocean . Now with GPS receiver that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth , it 's hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally , vanish . As Donald Crowhurst did . A number of yachtsman signed up ( all men back then ) , including mystery man , Crowhurst . Essentially a weekend sailor , Crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise , including career in the British Army , the Air Force and a an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aid . He wanted to do something big with his life , and he saw the five thousand pound first prize ( well over $ 100,000 in today 's money ) and the ensuing publicity a a mean of kick starting his business . He signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat , and which meant failure would bankrupt him , and soon found himself a popular figure with journalist a he prepared for the race . Now the Brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the 'pros ' . ( Think Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jump competition , and the amateur rider who regularly start the Grand National horse race . ) The public queued up to see him set off , but his boat wa n't really ready , and even a he started ( the last competitor to leave the UK ) Crowhurst must have known he did n't seriously have a chance . But too much wa riding on him to quit . In the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife 's face . Left behind with their 4 child , she is interviewed movingly throughout the film , together with one of Crowhurst 's son . She wa in a no-win situation . Had she attempted to stop him , she would have been considered a spoiler , but afterward she wa riven with doubt , a to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him . Faced with the certain truth that his boat wa leaking and would never make it through the southern ocean , and unable to turn around and face ridicule , bankruptcy and ignominy , Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat . Laid up offshore Argentina and Brazil , out of radio contact , he waited for the leader to round Cape Horn and start back up the Atlantic , thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe . He elaborately falsified his log , and made 16mm film and audio recording to back up his plan . But a one after another the other competitor dropped out , he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his log would be scrutinized . Unable to face certain detection , his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide . His yacht wa found . He never wa . This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier , an experienced and enigmatic French sailor , who wa in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize , when he abruptly left the race , unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face , and sailed into the wide blue yonder , eventually pulling up some 10 month later in Tahiti . Having spent some seven year working at sea myself , ( albeit on very different ship to these ) I well understand the pull of the ocean . Standing on deck , seeing water in every direction to the horizon , knowing there 's a couple of mile of water below you , nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull , without easy access to TV or radio ( even nowadays on most working ship , you feel pretty isolated ) , it 's possible to truly escape from the responsibility of everyday life for a while . There is some thoughtful analysis of what drive people to attempt this kind of very long , lonely journey and the effect it ha on the human mind . Most people would think that attempting to raise 4 child is adventure enough , but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardship at sea , the search for self . I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston , the ex navy guy who won the race ( and many since ) probably knew pretty well who he wa before he set off , which wa why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route . Those who went searching for something profound within themselves , may not have entirely liked what they found . The marvelous archive footage of Britain in the late 60 is almost reason enough to watch this , ( did it really look quite that bad ? I do n't remember it looking quite so dowdy , but perhaps we blot out the worst aspect of the past ? ) but overall , it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie . Highly recommended .",1
"`` Ally McBeal '' wa a decent enough show , but it wa very overrated . The character become boring after a while and the joke begin to fall short . I think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave - it wa starting to outstay it welcome .",0
"Bad , ambient sound . Lots of shuffling . Loooong pointless scene . Eg : guy see interesting woman in lobby . Manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package . Says nothing . Stares creepily . More shuffling and other irritating ambient noise . Wait . Wait . Wait . Guy say nothing . Woman look frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so . Manager come back with package . Guy go up to the apartment with the package . Another example : the guy and his host sit around watching bad TV . More ambient noise and shuffling . Wait wait wait wait . Guy wanders off to bed . If you can stand to sit through any more of this movie , you get to watch them watch TV again later . If you want a story , any dialogue , entertainment , or a well crafted film , look elsewhere .",0
"Okay so I love Aidan Quinn 's acting even with a bad script . This is not the case in The Assignment . As other viewer have said , this wa a movie I stumbled upon on cable and got so into it I did n't want it to end . Take one Cuban American Navy Ofc . ( Quinn ) who is an upright , uptight soldier and family man . Add a crazed agent ( Donald Sutherland ) who is looking for the world most notorious terrorist and add a Ben Kingsley and you have `` The Assignment '' . Sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist Carlos action in a cafe on a lovely day where he is so profoundly rocked at this man evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man a long a he draw breath . Take one soldier on a pas in Israel who is a dead ringer for this man and is beaten and held by Kingsley until they realize they have a plan . By taking on Carlos by being him , or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him , make for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip . By not helping his country he is bound a a man and his military duty to chose wisely . So the training begin . Lets say Carlos training is right up there with the academy of art and holocaust . When I say this intense and wonderfully casted , scripted and executed film rate the best , I am not understating it . All three actor could save almost any script .. together this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credit . I am not into terrorism or movie about it but I got hooked ! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn who for once play a heavy that could hold up to any actor including Gary Oldman . Thats a compliment . Rent it and get lot of popcorn . Oh did I mention the sex ? ? It work better than `` Last Tango ! `` and it educational .",1
"You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it wa ( besides the song ) , well their manager Simon Fuller ( also this band 's manager ) make the same error putting S Club ( another of my favourite band ) in their own film . S Club : Tina Barrett , Jon Lee , Bradley Mcintosh , Jo O'Meara , Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens ( what happened to the seventh member , Paul Cattermole ? ) basically ask their bos for a break , they go on , and while there they see themselves on TV ! Three of them swap , and vice versa , half discover they are clone made by a greedy scientist , and the other half just get themselves in trouble . Also starring Gareth Gates a a clone of himself . This film may have more of a plot than Spice Girls ' film did , but besides the song `` Bring It All Back '' , `` Do n't Stop Movin ' '' and `` Never Had A Dream Come True '' this is no goo reason to see this film . Not too long after the band split for good . Adequate !",0
"I saw SEA OF DUST a part of a NYC screening audience several year ago . I enjoyed the film at that time , so I wa a little confused by some of the amendment that had been made since . Perhaps it 's my memory , but there seemed to be chunk of exposition missing from the version that wa shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival . I 'm really not sure which version I prefer , but I can honestly say that I found something to appreciate it both . Let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie . Although it 's been promoted a a Hammer Films tribute , people expecting a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula are going to be sorely disappointed . There 's some cleavage , but no nudity ( a staple of the British production house 's later movie ) . And while SEA OF DUST is filled with gorgeous eye candy ( it really is shot like a sixty film ) , and feature Hammer starlet Ingrid Pitt , it 's not like any of the company 's picture in tone or execution . This film is very dark , very confusing , and ( at time ) very funny . I do n't remember the earlier version being quite a nutty a this one , but that 's not a bad thing ( especially the showdown in the Black Forest that play like a Three Stooges short ) . And some of Ms Pitt 's ranting are quite entertaining . It 's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose . The uniqueness of this film doe n't lie with the borrowed detail , though . It 's in the idea . As an occasional Sci Fi Channel viewer , I 've regularly taken the network to task for it one-note variation on a theme ( CGI monster kill , then get destroyed ) . SEA OF DUST is so full of idea that you start to trip over them after a while . But do n't get me wrong . I 'm not complaining . If anything , I applaud these guy for making such an enterprising low-budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concept . It 's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movie ( you know who you are ) . But for the rest of u , those of u who are tired of the formula of modern horror film , the predictability , the lack of respect for the audience , this may just be your ticket .",1
"This is a good time to say how good I think of this site : it give me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration I lived for two hour , awaiting for something to happens , for something to be said , to be shown , to be insinuated subtly , for a symbol , an idea , whatever . No , just long , endless violin , alternated by a tired piano . Tired voice , tired actor and bored character and situation . Boring is the long death of the mind , and this movie is , from that point of view , a public enemy . How many thousand of live hour will be still stolen to another thousand of innocent spectator . I do n't claim for my money back , just for my time and the time of person I invited to watch this thing ... oh God !",0
"I 'm a Christian . I have always been skeptical about movie made by Christians , however . As a rule , they are `` know-nothings '' when it come to movie production . I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . However , they did a hideous job of it . The acting wa horrible , and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some fashion , one COULD NOT have understood what the movie wa trying to get across . Not only wa the movie terribly made , but the people who made it even had some fact wrong . However , in this `` critique '' , those fact are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . In short , the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen , and I would not recommend it to anyone , except for comic relief from the every day grind .",0
"Having finally caught up with this `` masterpiece , '' it strike me that it must have seemed terribly clever , in it day . It 's French , arty , under-played to the point of agony , and ultimately downbeat . But viewed from the vantage of 37 year in the future , it 's also just a bit vacuous , pretentious and unsatisfying . Others have summarized the story , but I do n't think anyone ha pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film : the lead character , Corey and Vogel , really do n't deserve what they get . They play square within their code , never harm anyone who did n't ask for it , and show great courage and initiative . Moreover , Corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland 'friend , ' who stole his girl and who repeatedly try to have him killed , apparently just because he ( Corey ) dared to 'borrow ' a few thousand franc . These are guy who really ought to be due for a break ! Instead , thing go far worse for them than they really need to , within the logic of the story . One might contend that this is the whole point : that the real villain never get caught ; that they collude with the police a needed , sell out their friend , and always come out on top . But that 's not shown either . Corey 's old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police . Nor is he shown gloating over his victory . In fact , after materializing several time when he 's needed , he 's nowhere to be seen at the conclusion , leaving a dramatic tension ( his feud with Corey ) entirely unresolved ! Nonetheless , I 'd say this film is well worth seeing for it beautiful photography , it slow , deliberate pacing , it great deadpan performance , it elaborate heist sequence , and it encapsulation of the art-film style of the late 1960s .",1
"Thoughtless , ignorant , ill-conceived , career-killing ( where is the talented Angela Jones now ? ) , deeply unfunny garbage . It 's no wonder Reb Braddock ha n't directed anything else since - anyone who ha a chance to make his first film on his own rule , based on his own script , with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself , and creates something like THIS , anyone who feel that THIS wa a story worth telling to the world , doe n't deserve a second break . Under the circumstance , the performance are good - the actor do what they 're told to do , and they do it well . It 's just that they should n't have done it in the first place . 0 out of 4 .",0
"Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedian in film today . With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy , and we love him for it . He ha the ability to make mediocre comedy ( ala Ace Ventura ) , and turn them into decent comedic outing . Or , in the case of 'Liar Liar ' , make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedy around . Carrey ha also proven himself capable of tackling drama . He wa excellent in both 'Man on the Moon ' and 'The Truman Show . ' The guy is remarkable . Then come 'Bruce Almighty , ' an ideal vehicle for Carrey , and a premise that should have worked ; Carrey , after complaining about God and how his life stink , is enabled with God 's power . However , the script is pure recycled garbage . Now , no matter how bad a script is , Carrey 's improvisation alone sometimes make an unfunny scene funny . The problem is that there are very few opportunity for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effect , only some of which are amusing . Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he ha to work around the special effect . The writer apparently thought that all these special effect and superpower sequence were funny , because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless . He seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention , wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny , when it 's really just annoying . I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends ' and she wa superb in last year 's 'The Good Girl . ' She too ha a gift for comedy , but with the script a linear a it is , she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend . She come across a nagging , grumpy , and there is no chemistry between the two star . 'Bruce Almighty ' should have been a comedy that work . But it doe n't even have the gut to tackle the subject matter that it 's making fun of ; religion . A few minor giggle ( his internet is Yehweh ) , but instead it 's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy . Not to mention that it 's tone shift from silly to heavy-handed , and even black comedy at time . The movie fails on nearly every level . That 's not to see it is entirely devoid of laugh , but it 's close . Any movie that feel the need to incorporate scene of a dog peeing to get it 's laugh ha problem . But hey , if you find pee joke funny , go for it .",0
"Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British ( I think ) DVD-label , specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movie  mostly Italian one - from the glorious era when everything wa possible , namely from the late 60 's up until the mid-80 's . The label 's selection feel like a crossover between the oeuvre of `` Mondo Macabro '' and `` No Shame '' ( they probably even borrowed the name of the latter ) and they already released some really rare sick Italian puppy like `` Ratman '' , `` My Dear Killer '' , `` Killer Nun '' , `` Phantom of Death '' and `` Torso '' . `` The Frightened Woman '' wa completely unknown to me , but since fellow reviewer from around here , whose opinion I hugely value , described it a one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro-sexploitation movie of it era , I did n't hesitate to pick it up . This is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 % of the average cinema-loving audience . If you 're part of that remaining 1 % , however , you 're in for a really unique treat . The style , atmosphere and content are similar to Jess Franco 's `` Succubus '' and Massimo Dallamano 's `` Venus in Furs '' , yet they 're both widely considered a classic whereas `` The Frightened Woman '' is virtually unknown . It 's all a matter of profiling and good marketing , I guess . The story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor ( he life in a gigantic secluded mansion , owns multiple old-timer car and ha a very impressive collection of artsy relic including a life-size mannequin doll replica of himself ) with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards woman . He considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his day kidnapping , humiliating and sexually abusing random he pick up from the street . Dr. Sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit , but he slowly fall for her . Just he start to believe in actual love , she strike back with a vengeance . This really is n't for everyone , but if you can appreciate moody & sinisterly sexy ambiance , bizarre scenery toy and psychedelic touch that seem utterly implausible and surreal , you can consider this one a top recommendation . It 's slow , stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers Shameless Entertainment , all right !",1
"The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia 's `` Nine Lives '' come when Sissy Spacek , hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with Aiden Quinn , find a nature documentary on television , at which point Quinn note the contrivance of such thing -- disparate footage is edited into one scene , predator and prey are thrown together in order to capture the moment -- all to force connection where none actually exist . Characters in the nine short that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others story , but none of them ever seem to really connect . A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy . A man who run into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and see how his life should have been later host , with his current wife , a dinner party for an unhappy couple . Garcia arranges some of his character in front of each other , but none of the subsequent story ever really build on what came before . Garcia 's first film , the wonderful , overlooked `` Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her , '' also had a short-story structure and overlapping character , but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow . The gimmicky premise of `` Nine Lives , '' that each of it nine story is told in a single , unbroken take in real time , never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum . It 's also a fairly visually ugly movie . Interior shot are often murky and hard to watch , while other scene -- particularly one where a girl walk back and forth between room to talk to her uncommunicative parent -- are rendered annoying by the camera-work . Given that this is Garcia 's third film and that he ha a respectable history of directing for television , the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish . Like fellow filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer Rebecca Miller , Garcia ( son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez ) is focused on the writing and character aspect of his film often to the detriment of the film-making one . Individual scene are touching and even affecting . I did like Jason Issacs kissing Robin Wright Penn 's pregnant belly . And Joe Mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife a she slip into pre-surgery sedation . And Sissy Spacek stealing a few happy moment away from her life with Aiden Quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter . But the film ( unlike `` Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her '' ) feel more like an exercise than actual drama . We are just watching people act .",0
"MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! How did such talented actor get involved in such mindless retreaded drivel ? Robert DeNiro play a Dumb Hollywood version of the standard violence prone tough cop ( i.e. , he beat up the bad guy and roll his eye at cop who prefer to stick by the book ) , and Eddie Murphy play a not so tough cop who would rather be an actor ( i.e. , he scream out , `` Freeze , police ! '' and ha his `` tough look '' down pat ) . Naturally , they are partnered when Bobby 's loose cannon tactic get him in hot water with the medium and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a `` Cops '' -like reality show . Take a breath , cuz that 's a funny a it get . No energy wa put into the script - it feel like a pale retread of every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with `` 15 Minutes '' starring , yes , DeNiro himself a , pretty much the character he is playing here . The joke fall flat , the action feel listless , and no one seems to be having a good time . It 's dead on the screen . Please do n't waste your time . Even if you have an overwheming affinity for one of the actor - avoid it and do them a favor . Becauze if this make money , these kinda of script will be deeemed perfectly acceptable for actor of their quality . And to Mr. DeNiro . You used to make serious film . I remember them - they were good . You were nominated for award for them - remember how much fun that wa ? Now after `` Analyze This '' ( which wa good ) , `` Meet the Parents '' ( which wa also good ) , and `` The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle '' ( which wa NOT good ) , I think we need to see you parodying yourself le , and BEING yourself more . `` Casino '' feel like a long time ago . And no , I do n't count `` 15 Minutes '' a serious Bobby . Anyone who took that medium satire seriously must get their weekly world news",0
"I ca n't really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie . A woman meet a man , he want to play game , she too , but only until she realise what she 's missing . She leaf , and that 's it really . It took 9 1/2 week before Elizabeth ( Kim Basinger ) left John ( Mickey Rourke ) . She should have left him after 30 minute and ended our misery .",0
"A major disappointment . This wa one of the best UK crime drama / detective show from the 90 's which developed the fascinating title character played by Scotland 's Robbie Coltrane . However this one-off ha little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectation when a favored show return after a long hiatus . Coltrane is n't really given much to do , much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer , and in what he ha to act in , he seems uninvolved , almost bored . The ex-soldier 's story is written by the book and the attempt to update u on Coltrane 's family life seems lightweight . Perhaps if the writer had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth . As is , skip this and watch the old Cracker from the 90 's which is far far superior .",0
"I saw this movie only because Sophie Marceau . However , her acting ability it 's no enough to salve this movie . Almost all cast do n't play their character well , exception for Sophie and Frederic . The plot could give a rise a better movie if the right piece wa in the right place . I saw several good french movie but this one i do n't like .",0
"OK , how 's this for original- this mean , rich old geezer leaf his estate to his adult child , all of them ungrateful loser , and two creepy servant , provided they spend the week in his spooky old house . What happens that night will surprise only those who have n't seen a movie or television show before . After a string of murder in which the victim look like they 're bleeding restaurant ketchup , we have a painfully obvious twist ending . The cast is lead by some once respectable actor must have been desperate for their paycheck . There are also a few second-tier actor who were rising at the time but long forgotten now . As a result , the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of `` Matlock . '' I will give credit where it 's due- the closing scene is clever and amusing , if you 're still awake .",0
"L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy , and it 's honest , realistic , and refreshing . Not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in Barcelona for one year . Beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack . If you 're older , this movie should bring back a flood of good memory . If you 're young , learn by this example .",1
"Make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season ! If you admire Dennis Morgan or Barbara Stanwyck , this film is a fun one to watch . They really work well together a you would see in this movie . The whole cast wa very entertaining . Since I 'm a Dennis Morgan fan , this film wa a real treat ! But ... everyone can enjoy it ! Recommended !",1
"`` Så som i himmelen `` .. a above so below .. that very special point where Divine and Human meet . I ADORE this film ! A gem . YES amazing grace ! I wa so deeply moved by it very HUMAN quality . I laughed and cried through a whole register , indeed several octave of emotion . Mikael Nyqvist ís BRILLIANT a Daniel , a first rate passionate performance , charismatic and powerful . His inner light and exceptional talent shine through in every scene , every interaction , in every meeting . I wa totally mesmerised , enchanted and caught up the story , which is our collective story , the story of life itself . The film wa also so inclusive of many archetype , messiah , wounded child , magical child , artist , teacher , priest , abuser , abused , victim , bully , divine fool - ALL the character so real and true to life - all awakened great fondness and compassion in me . It is a real treat to see such a thought provoking yet thoroughly enjoyable , entertaining film . Oh .. must n't forget the heavenly choir of angel and breathtakingly beautiful sound . THANK YOU ALL - This Swedish film will surely captivate people world-wide . BRILLIANT !",1
"At the height of the 'Celebrity Big Brother ' racism row in 2007 ( involving Shilpa Shetty and the late Jade Goody ) , I condemned on an internet forum those ' C.B.B . ' fan who praised the show , after year of bashing 'racist ' '70 's sitcom such a 'Curry & Chips ' & 'Love Thy Neighbour ' . I thought they were being hypocritical , and said so . 'It Ai n't Half Hot Mum ' wa then thrown into the argument , with some pointing out it had starred an English actor blacked-up . Well , yes , but Michael Bates had lived in India a a boy , and spoke Urdu fluently . The show 's detractor overlook the reality he brought to his performance a bearer 'Rangi Ram ' . The noted Indian character actor , Renu Setna , said in a 1995 documentary 'Perry & Croft : The Sitcoms ' that he wa upset when he heard Bates had landed the role , but added : `` No Indian actor could have played that role a well a Bates. '' . Indeed . 'Mum ' wa Perry and Croft 's companion show to 'Dad 's Army ' ; also set in wartime , the sedate English town of Walmington-On-Sea had been replaced by the hot , steamy jungle of India , in particularly a place called Deolali , where an army concert party put on show for the troop , among them Bombadier Solomons ( George Layton , his first sitcom role since 'Doctor In Charge ' ) , camp Gunner 'Gloria ' Beaumont ( Melvyn Hayes ) , diminutive Gunner 'Lofty ' Sugden , 'Lah de-dah ' Gunner Graham ( John Clegg ) , and Gunner Parkins ( the late Christopher Mitchell ) . Presiding over this gang of misfit wa the bellicose Sergeant-Major Williams ( the brilliant Windsor Davies ) , who regarded them all a 'poofs ' . His frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he wa nice to Parkins , whom he thought wa his illegitimate son ! ) . Then there wa ever-so English Colonel Reynolds ( Donald Hewlett ) and dimwitted Captain Ashwood ( Michael Knowles ) . Rangi wa like a wise old sage , beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure Hindu proverb . He loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself a practically British . His friend were the tea-making Char Wallah ( the late Dino Shafeek , who went on to 'Mind Your Language ' ) and the rope pulling Punka Wallah ( Babar Bhatti ) . So real Indians featured in the show - another point it detractor ignore . Shafeek also provided what wa described on the credit a 'vocal interruption ' ( similar to the '40 's song used a incidental music on 'Dad 's Army ' ) . Each edition closed with him warbling 'Land Of Hope & Glory ' only to be silenced by a 'Shut Up ! ' from Williams . The excellent opening theme wa penned by Jimmy Perry and Derek Taverner . Though never quite equalling 'Dad 's Army ' in the public 's affection , 'Mum ' nevertheless wa popular enough to run for a total of eight season . In 1975 , Davies and Estelle topped the chart with a cover version of that old chestnut 'Whispering Grass ' . They then recorded an entire album of old chestnut , entitled ( what else ? ) 'Sing Lofty ! ' . The show hit crisis point three year later when Bates died of cancer . Rather than recast the role of 'Rangi ' , the writer just let him be quietly forgotten . When George Layton left , the character of 'Gloria ' took his place a 'Bombadier ' , providing another source of comedy . The last edition in 1981 saw the soldier leave India by boat for Blighty , the Char Wallah watching them go with great sadness ( a did viewer ) . Repeats have been few and far between ( mainly on U.K. Gold ) all because of it so-called 'dodgy ' reputation . This is strange . For one thing , the show wa not specifically about racism . If a white man blacked-up is so wrong , why doe David Lean 's 1984 film ' A Passage to India ' still get shown on television ? ( it featured Alec Guinness a an Indian , and won two Oscars ! ) . It wa derived from Jimmy Perry 's own experience . Some character were based on real people ( the Sergeant-Major really did refer to his men a 'poofs ' ) . I take the view that if you are going to put history on television , get it right . Sanitizing the past , no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audience , is fundamentally dishonest . 'Mum ' wa both funny and truthful , and viewer saw this . Thank heaven for D.V.D . 's I say . Time to stop this review . As Williams would say : `` I 'll have no gossiping in this jungle ! ''",1
"I am from Texas , and live very close to Plano where the actual death occurred , so I might be a bit biased in saying that `` Wasted '' is a film that you just ca n't get out of your head . Stahl , Phoenix , and Paul all play their character very realistically . You truly believe that they are everyday high school student who just happen to be heroin addict . The drug content is handled very graphically a well - although everything that happens in the film serf a purpose , and each moment the character spiral further downward is heartbreaking . I definitely recommend this film to anyone . Once you watch it , it stick with you !",1
"Mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story . Everyone probably ha one , and this is writer-director Yasmin Ahmad 's story of hers , with a boy called Mukhsin . We know that her movie have been semi-autobiographical of sort , having scene drawn upon her personal experience , and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotion to the big screen , that ha her film always exude a warm sincerity and honesty . Mukhsin is no different , and probably the most polished ad confident work to date ( though I must add , a a personal bias , that Sepet still ha a special place in my heart ) . Our favourite family is back - Pak Atan , Mak Inom , Orked and Kak Yam , though this time , we go back to when Orked is age 10 . The character are all younger from the movie we 've journeyed with them , from Rabun to Gubra , and here , Sharifah Amani 's sister Sharifah Aryana and Sharifah Aleya take on the role of Orked and Mak Inom respectively , which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen , nevermind that their not playing sibling role . The only constant it seems is Kak Yam , played by Adibah Noor , and even Pak Atan ha hair on his head ! Through Mukshin the movie , we come full circle with the character , and the world that Yasmin ha introduced u to . We come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more , set in the day when they 're still living in their kampung ( revisited back in Rabun ) , where Orked attends a Chinese school , and pack some serious combination of punch ( and you wonder about that burst of energy in Gubra , well , she had it in her since young ! ) . The perennial tomboy and doted child of the family , she prefers playing with the boy in game , rather than mindless `` masak-masak '' with the girl , and favourite outing include going with the family to football match . The arrival of a boy called Mukhsin ( Mohd Syafie Naswip ) to the village provides a cool peer for Orked to hang out and do stuff with - cycling through the village , climbing tree , flying kite . And a what is desired to be explored , the crossing of that line between friendship and romance , both beautiful emotion . Mukhsin doe have it cheeky moment which liven up the story , and bring about laughter , because some of the incident , we would have experienced it ourselves , and sometimes serve a a throwback to our own recollection of childhood . In short , those scene screamed `` fun '' ! We observe the life in a typical kampung , where some neighbour are very nice , while others , the nosy parker and rumour monger , spreading ill gossip stemming from envy . There are 2 additional family dynamic seen , one from an immediate neighbour , and the other from Mukhsin 's own , both of which serve a adequate subplots , and contrast to Orked 's own . As always , Yasmin 's movie are filled with excellent music , and for Mukhsin , it ha something special , the song `` Hujan '' a penned by her father , a well a `` Ne Me Quitte Pas '' , aptly used in the movie Given that the Yasmin 's movie to date have been centred around the same character , the beauty of it is that you can watch them a stand alone , or when watched and pieced together , make a compelling family drama dealing with separate theme and universal issue like interracial romance , love , and forgiveness . Fans will definitely see the many link in Mukhsin back to the earlier movie , while new audience will surely be curious to find out certain why and significance of recurring character or event , like that pudgy boy who steal glance at Orked . And speaking of why , part of Mukhsin too is curiously open , which probably is distinctive of Yasmin 's style , or deliberately left a such . I thought that a a story about childhood , recollected from memory , then there are detail which will be left out for sure . And subtly , I felt that Mukhsin exhibited this perfectly , with not so detailed detail , and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episode between the two . Another highly recommended movie , and a rare one that I feel is suitable for all age - bring along your kid brother or sister !",1
"The film is partly a thriller and partly a public-service announcement when seeing the event through the perspective of politician , terrorist and of course victim . In this smart drama lesson are given about contamination and surviving chaos while meantime the backstage look at the way crisis is managed prompt viewer to distrust guardian and to be scared by assailant . The film , originally aired on BBC , get to arouse effectively doubt on official prepareparedness . Performances are proper , understated though never terrific . The flick is just a beginning , a provocative start leading to a larger discussion but it get to work in my opinion , giving the right thrill and causing the audience to reason and to ask itself question .",1
"This could have been great . The voice-overs are exactly right and fit the character to a T. One small problem though ; the look of the character , mostly the supporting or guest character look exactly the same . The same bored look on every face only with minor change such a hairline or weight size . It look kind of odd to see a really big guest star 's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the character here . If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voice-over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny . There is a few other problem , one being the family plot . The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situation the character got themselves into . Here we get too much annoying diversion , like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off . As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more `` Married with Children '' . If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it 's repetitiveness . Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others . Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of one-dimensional . Seth Green a the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show . So what more can I say . There is n't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it take a lot of work to do what the Simpsons ha done for almost two decade .",0
"A good documentary reviewing the background behind our society oil addiction , the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally discus the effect of the coming energy deficit originating from the peak oil production problem . This movie should be educated to all student a part of their education . Show it to your child , parent , relative and friend . They will thank you eventually . After reviewing the content of this documentary and comparing it mentioned source I would say that the fact in this movie are well scientifically supported .",1
"Not the best plot in the world , but the comedy in this movie rule . Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie . Another funny guy is Rob Schneider who will make you crack up with his segment with Ken Hudson Campbell who play Buckman . Lauren Holly play probably the more serious character in the cast a Lt. Lake . Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie , playing probably the most serious character in the movie . The actor i liked the most wa Toby Huss a Nitro , all the electric shot his character take in the movie is hilarious . Plot is a little uneven , about Lt . Commander Tom Dodge , who for year ha wanted to Command his own sub . When he finally get the chance , instead of a brand new sub , he get a rusty WWII Diesel Sub , the Stingray . His crew is n't any better , misfit of the U.S. Navy . He is then put in a series of War Games , that show how an old Diesel Engine can handle itself against the current Nuclear Navy . Things still do n't get any better when he find out his dive officer is actually a female officer , to see how Women do on actual Subs . To get the commander position he want , he ha to win the War Games , and blow up a Dummy Ship . The movie fair quite well , in fact i laughed non-stop when i saw this movie in theater . I loved when they were in silence and Buckman fart , and everyones reaction to the smell is hilarious . Overall , 9 out of 10 , this movie is just plain fun to watch , it nice to have a movie like this , i hate movie that try to be 100 % serious .",1
What a surprise ; two outstanding performance by the lead actress in this film . This is the best work Busy Phillips ha ever done and the best from Erika Christensen since Traffic . This film certainly should be in Oscar contention . See this movie !,1
"Felt it wa very balanced in showing what Jehovahs Witnesses have done in protecting American freedom . It also showed the strong faith of two family who were first generation witness . I also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a Jehovahs Witness affect non-witness family member and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they do n't celebrate holiday , the sad part is that non-witness family do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners/visits or give them gift at any other time but for holiday or birthday . When it come to medical care the witness want and expect a high standard of medical care , what people forget is that blood transfusion allow for sloppy medical care and surgery whereas bloodless treatment cause the medical team to be highly skilled and trained , which would you prefer to treat your loved one ? I highly recommend this video !",1
"A proof that it 's not necessary for a movie to have a deep many-layered story and other sophisticated element to be a good movie . Even if the story could be expanded in many direction , especially in more sociological way ( people lust for money ) it seems that it 's perfect just the way it is . Through many sudden change it take the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complication and without letting the spectator taking the eye of the screen . But the acting for me is n't so good . With the exception of Lindsey McKeon the others were average or even worst . In some scene they just empty-stared in front of themselves . For exception of Lindsey which wa more convincing . It 's a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying . 7/10",1
"I also saw this at the cinema in the 80 and have never forgotten it , even though I have never seen it again anywhere . I do n't know whether if I did see it now it would seem dated , but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern film I 've seen on Zone Horror I should think it would stand up very well . I can still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead body becoming reanimated , and the blue lightning . Having seen hundred of horror movie and still remembering this one , it must be good .",1
"The film `` Chaos '' take it name from Gleick 's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory . What doe the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie `` Chaos '' ? Nothing . The film maker seem to have skimmed the book ( obviously without understanding a thing about it ) looking for a `` theme '' to united the series of mundane action sequence that overlie the flimsy string of event that act in place of a plot in the film . In this respect , the movie `` Choas '' resembles the Canadian effort `` Cube , '' in which prime number function a a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed : in `` Cube '' a bunch of prime number are tossed in so that viewer will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about prime : the same approach is taken in `` Chaos '' : disconnected extract from Gleick 's book are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever . This , of course , is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience , and any literate viewer of `` Chaos '' who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered . How could a film so bad be made ? Rewritten a a novel , the story in `` Chaos '' would probably not even make it past a literary agent 's secretary 's desk . How could ( at least ) hundred of thousand ( and probably million ) of dollar have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film ? Regarding what 's in the movie , every performance is phoned in . Save for technical glitch , it would be astonishing if more than one take wa used for any one scene . The story is uniformly senseless : the last time I saw a story to disconnected it wa the production of a literal eight-year-old . Among other massive shortcoming are the following : The bad guy leaf hint for the police to follow . He ha no reason whatsoever for leaving such hint . Police officer do not carry or use radio . Dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy . Let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film . If there is any other movie you like ( or even simply do not hate ) watch that instead .",0
"I rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh . We actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie taste . Unfortunately , I do n't remember the first half of the movie because all I did wa stare at the giant metal brace Jane wore . and I did n't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp . The other thing that wa able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth wa her questionable fashion sense . This movie wa made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes . If you remember the day when Aaron Carter wa considered a `` popstar '' and you like high waisted jean , ankle sock and knee length skirt , then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you .",0
"Silent historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn , newly arrived lady-in-waiting to the Queen who catch the lustful eye of Henry VIII , bad-tempered King of England who love to feast , drink , hunt , be entertained by his court jester , watch joust , and chase around after young beauty who jump out of cake and assorted attractive female around the castle . Well , he 's soon annulled his marriage , married Anne , and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir . She fails on that score and he soon ha his eye on yet another lady-in-waiting . Meanwhile , Anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant , perturbed , or downright ready to burst into tear . She just doe n't come across a a happy camper ( or is it just bad acting ? ! ) . This film is a solid piece of entertainment , with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hour - plus I enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print . Emil Jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-done portrayal of King Henry the Eighth - he really seemed like he WAS Henry the Eighth . I am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who play Anne , seemed a bit over the top . The DVD of this film feature an appropriate , nicely done piano score that perfectly suit this story . Quite a good film .",1
"As a camera operator , I could n't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved . The performance were excellent , a wa the story . Just when I thought this film wa about to slow down , it did n't . Heart-pounding tension , great pacing through editing , and a score that know when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction . The camera wa always in the right place . Love that .",1
"I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I can say is ... '' What did I just watch ? ? ? ? '' And I mean that in a good and bad way . The plot is really simple . Stiller and Black play friends/neighbors . Stiller is the focused , hardworker while Black is a dreamer . Black invents this idea to create a spray that era poo . The idea becomes very popular , and Black becomes very rich . The extravagant lifestyle that Black gain and the fact that he still try to be best friend with Stiller cause Stiller to become crazy with envy . As I said , the plot is simple . Everything else is plain odd . The direction is odd , with a weird rotating opening shot to out-of-nowhere sped up sequence . The dialouge and the acting is very odd ; odd in a rambling sort of way . And the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie , from the weird `` Envy '' song that keep on reappearing to the scene where you think you 're going to hear a classic 80 's song but suddenly it 's in Japanese . So , the true question is this ... is odd funny ? That depends purely on the individual . I wa cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie . After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it wa free . Strangely , I understood their point . There are no joke whatsoever , so if you are n't hooked by the uniqueness of it all , you will hate this movie . Absolutely hate it . This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic . If you can laugh at a movie with no real joke , like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love , then I suggest you see it . If you do n't , run away from this movie . It 'll only make you mad .",1

But Thomas ' friend arrive to help save the day . The wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in Paris . This is a charming film . The song , including `` Everybody Wants to be a Cat '' , are lively and upbeat . The voice cast is excellent , with Eva Gabor ( who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney 's THE RESCUERS film ) a Duchess , Phil Harris ( Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK , Little John in ROBIN HOOD ) a Thomas , giving interesting personality to their character . Supposedly Walt Disney , before he died in 1966 , gave the go-ahead to this film . Recommended for Disney fan or cat lover everywhere ! 10/10 .",1
"Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines , Iowa . Nine band member who all wear customized boilersuit , and personalized , homemade mask ( eg . # 6 's clown mask , # 0 's various gasmask , # 8 's tattered + torn crashtest dummie mask with dreadlock ) . The music itself seems to walk the finelines between sane and otherwise , yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic . `` Welcome To Our Neighborhood '' sound rather a generic title , but the footage itself is something else . Interviews with the band , soundbites from their latest , selftitled album , 2 live performance , and one banned-by-MTV music video ( a brilliant homage to the classic Kubrick film `` The Shining '' ) , the movie clock in at not even half-an-hour , but is certainly worth it . It is perfect for introducing any metal/hardcore fan to Slipknot .",1
"The review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent . No you should n't . There are spoiler at the end of this review but how I can `` spoil '' this rotten movie I have no idea . Even if you are a die hard Alien/Pred fan like I am wait for the DVD . It is n't worth a 3.99 rental either but you 'll be much le inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 buck or better per person plus concession purchase at a theater . In the theater I watched AVPr there were exactly two laugh , both by a girl sitting next to me . Other than that there wa total silence throughout . No ooohs , or `` that wa bad as ! `` , nothing . Imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic . Now you know what you 'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of AVPr . What wa the budget on this movie ? Like War of the Worlds , MI 3 , and other f/x driven movie the director seems far more involved in what the CGI people can come up with than developing character or a plot . Spielberg ha tried and failed at this several time , usually with Tom Cruise . Sure the movie make money but should they ? War of the Worlds and Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent script , Tom Cruise et al , and SS himself but were still awful . I 'm sure AVP wasted 90 % of their budget on CG and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actor at random . There is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised . Who care who get killed ? We did n't know any of them , we all know what happens when the lil alien make their corporeal exit , we all know the blood is acid . In Alien , Aliens , 3 , Resurrection , and even AVP the director make use of the fact that the Aliens can think , can hide and can lay trap . This director decided that the Ridley Scott , James Cameron , and others were idiot for developing character you actually want to see either live or get killed . In this installment you will never care who life or dy , not a kid , a parent , a pregnant woman . The character serve only one purpose in this movie , to die . The opening scene establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke . The character development scene mix clichés , bad humor , and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really do n't care if they get killed so long a they die in never before seen way . But they do n't . The director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the Alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good part of the first film , the human protagonist , and stealing the rest from other recent sci-fi film . There is not one original use of the either the Alien or Pred character . The Pred actually ha little trouble killing Aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led u to believe that Pred revered the Aliens a such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one a Rite of Passage . The AlienPred is never really developed a a fearsome creature . Its ability to inject parasite into a host is ripped from several different movie most recently probably wa Hellboy where Samiel 's dismembered tongue injected egg into Hellboy or Doom where the mutated creature would leave their tongue behind after they speared a victim 's throat . Simply put we are n't given reason to care about anything in this movie . There is violence but it doe n't shock or surprise and is nothing that ha n't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flick . The CG is OK and both specie of alien are made to look and move a they have in movie past . But since the character are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die . The little girl wa probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we are n't made to care whether or not kid , woman , or anyone else life or dy . We just want the movie to end . Eventually it doe but not before another stolen plot line from Resident Evil 2 ha a nuke aim Gunnison 's way to wipe out the `` infection '' . And not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequel but doe it ? In a movie filled with bad scene the worst may have been saved for last . Sorry for the repetition but everything bear repeating : bad script , no plot , unoriginal action scene , uninspired direction , abysmal acting , decent f/x that were wasted because of the many flaw . I do n't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed . The actor and director and crew are probably getting their career going and working on a shoestring budget . For a movie with this type of budget and hype I feel cheated along with disappointed . This movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credit . Sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 wa the best part of AVPr and HB2 did n't even look that good .",0
"The movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream . There is not enough realism to hold the viewer 's interest . The Vermont Farm scene wa a failed opportunity to show the way farm were set up and farm family lived which would have been interesting and entertaining . There wa little if no research into the whiskey bootlegging trade of the period . The costume of the Canadians looked like something from the French Revolution , totally unbelievable . The fiddle playing wa good and of the time period but Chris 's motion while supposedly playing were unbelievable . The owl 's appearance wa a never explained mystery and the train disappearing into thin air wa too much . I could n't understand how a live trout got frozen into the ice and why two men in the wilderness without food would release the trout , a good food source .",0
"It 's 2005 , my friend ... a time of amazing special effect and an age of technology . So , why ca n't we see a movie that 's a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film . I 've seen a lot of low-budget movie that rock my sock off , but this one ... it 's almost a if it 's trying to be horrible . Just ... do n't ... watch it . I can look past lack of special effect and computer generated scene if the acting itself wa at least good . I feel like a small child produced this entire movie . There 's not even an original plot line . Vampire Assassins , in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself . Can someone tell me if , perhaps , this wa designed a a comedy movie and I just did n't know it ? It make me wonder , what doe the sequel have in store for u who so loved the first installment ?",0
"Even with a cast that boast such generally reliable name a Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow , Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film . It barely brush the surface of the incident that happened on that July night in 1981 . Kilmer just go through the motion a John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead role ; a Holmes 's wife and underage girlfriend , respectively . The rest of the cast ha such small role that it 's impossible to get any dimension from them . The film also star Carrie Fisher , Ted Levine , Franky G , MC Gainey , Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton .",0
"In the colony we 're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey , so I nearly skipped this film ( which had it TCM preview recently ) on account of the negative comment here on his appearance in `` Ghost Train '' -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying . Instead I wa pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly . The physical aspect of Askey 's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you 'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby . There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyor of comic relief who turn up in film of this genre . One can feel , moreover , the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 year later ; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he ha more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterpart over here . As for the rest of the film -- the more movie you 've seen , the more likely you 'll guess at the ending , but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for it next appearance .",1
"Probably New Zealands worst Movie ever made The Jokes They are not funny . Used from other movie & just plain corny The acting Is bad even though there is a great cast The story is Uninteresting & Boring Has more cheese then pizza hut cheese lover pizza kind of like the acting Has been do 1,000 time before I watched this when it came on TV but wa so boring could only stand 30 minute of it . This movie suck Do not watch it , Watch paint dry instead",0
"Like the other comment say , this might be surprise to those who have n't seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica . But have you already seen Delicatessen , there is nothing new it this film . I thought Delicatessen wa great when it came out , but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest . I do n't think it 's a worse film than Delicatessen but it 's a bore to see it now , like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again . There is really no point to the film , nothing that really matter or stay with you . There may be a distant similarity to the film of Kusturica , but he 's really in a different league , so you should rather go see his film than waste your time on Tuvalu .",0
"To put it simply , The Fan wa a disappointment . It felt like a if I wa watching Taxi Driver , except Taxi Driver wa much better than this . It seemed like the filmmaker wanted u to root for Robert Deniro 's character 100 percent . This approach did n't work .",0
"The opening scene keep me from rating at absolute zero . I wish the entire movie wa a gritty and real a the intro . In order to enjoy some movie , a lot can be forgiven , ( hand gun with 60 shot , hero 's with super human power , all woman are gorgeous AND half naked ) but Puuuuleeese this `` Assault On My Intelligence 13 '' is so far fetched that I 'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming . Firstly , how did these guy get to be cop ? Based on stupidity I guess . How do the main female character justify being half naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or wherever the heck they are . As a matter of fact no character reacts to the element whatsoever in this movie . No window , no electricity ( which miraculously return unexplained ) during the storm of the century and they are all comfy a bug in a rug . What technology exists which disables all cell phone , radio , and brain function . This must be the same power which cause Maria Bella to walk from her disabled car knee deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress .",0
"In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussion of waterboarding , image of Abu Ghraib , or tale of forced detention at Guantanamo Bay , Gavin Hood 's `` Rendition '' is about a up-to-the-minute and timely a movie a is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mill of mainstream Hollywood . It 's not , by any stretch of the imagination , a perfect film , but neither doe it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it ha received at the hand of critic from all across the ideological and political spectrum . The term `` rendition '' refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individual it suspect of terrorist dealing , then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time , all without due process of law . Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who ha been living for twenty year in the United States . He ha an American wife , a young son and a new baby on the way . He seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist , yet one day , without warning or explanation , Anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claim to know nothing about . On the negative side , `` Rendition '' falter occasionally in it storytelling ability , often biting off a little more than it can chew in term of both plot and character . The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman , a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwar 's `` interrogation '' at the hand of Egyptian official . The problem is that , a conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal , Freeman seems too much of a naïve `` boy scout '' to make for a very plausible agent , and he is n't given the screen time he need to develop fully a a character . We know little about him at the beginning and even le , it seems , at the end . He `` go through the motion , '' but we learn precious little about the man within . Thus , without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together , the film occasionally feel a if it is coming apart at the seam , with story element flying off in all direction . A similar problem occurs with Anwar 's distraught wife , played by Reese Witherspoon , a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface . Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actor under other circumstance , but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely let them go beyond a single recurring note in their performance . What make `` Rendition '' an ultimately powerful film , however , is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot line elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie 's closing stretch . It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject , but , hey , this is Hollywood after all , and the film ha to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectation if it is to get itself green lighted , let alone see the light of day a a completed project . Two of the supporting performance are particularly compelling in the film : Omar Metwally who make palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he can not awaken , and Yigal Naor who make a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer . Meryl Streep , Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their mark in smaller role . Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebe . Does the movie oversimplify the issue ? Probably . Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government force ? Most definitely . ( One wonder how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist ) . Yet , the movie ha the gut to tread on controversial ground . It is n't afraid to raise dicey question or risk the disapproval of some for the political stance it take . It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to it hard-won principle of `` civil liberty for all '' in the face of terrorism and fear . And just how much courage doe it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say `` enough is enough , '' even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power ? ( The movie also doe not , in any way , deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism ) . Thus , to reject `` Rendition '' out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good . `` Rendition '' may not be perfect , but it IS good , and it ha something of importance to say about the world in which we now live . And that alone make it very much worth seeing .",1
"I 've never laughed and giggled so much in my life ! The first half kept me in stitch ; the last half made me come completely unglued ! I think I giggled for 15 minute after the tape wa over .

Which is probably why my `` laugh center '' wa so overwhelmed ; it took an extra 15 minute to laugh at everything .",1

"My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator ( the extra on the film ) and his unhappy assessment of the film . I think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director . The film wa sweet , the acting sufficient , the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week . It wa n't `` The Hours '' ( acting ) , or `` The Matrix '' ( Special Effects ) , or even `` The Color Purple '' ( Direction ) . Most movie wo n't be . But it also wa n't the crap fest that `` vinny ... '' would lead you to believe . Sorry guy , just my 2 cent . As to the movie itself , it wa in the end very gay affirming ( + # 1 ) . It showed a world full of diverse and le than perfect people -- you know , just like ours ( + # 2 ) ! It opened a door on one culture without excluding other culture ( + # 3 ) .

"The DVD version released by Crash Cinema wa very poorly done . The mastering engineer must have been either drunk , asleep or not even in the room while it wa being done . It look like it wa mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film , the audio synchronization disappears . The dialog is about 10 or 15 second behind the audio . If you 're thinking about purchasing this DVD , please save your money . I remember seeing this film at the theater back in 1973 . Also , the VHS copy of this film under the title of `` When Taekwondo Strikes '' look better than the DVD , but the remaining several minute of the movie are `` missing '' . Where is the original camera negative ?",0
"Ahh , nuthin ' like cheesy , explopitative , semi-porn , masquerading a horror ...

They turn to a large-brained evil genius in a wheelchair , and his family of moronic misfit , who us mind control to send out zombie to do his nefarious bidding . Said-genius ha a giant head , hence the clever title of the film : that 's about the extent of the film 's humor . But basically , it 's an excuse to show off the ample talent of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo ( Ernestina ) . Laced with some of the wierdest dialogue can be herd ( what the heck is `` plowing oat '' , anycow ? ? ) , and just plain stupid , this titular thriller will moost likey appeal to the breast-cownters of Drive-In Theater , but no one else .

"i happen to love this show . Its a refreshing take on some older sci-fi feel and style . they are n't afraid to shoot , and when they do people tend to die . Far too many show 's are afraid of this and end up just pointing the gun and then having it be a standoff . Farscape also come complete with a large amount of heartwarming character . They all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discus taking some of the animatronic one out of their box 's to make the mini-series . From beginning to end farscape leaf you with a feeling of hope , and dispair , a new and unexpected thing happen and then people live and die , surprising you every time .

"Wow , i 'm a huge Henry VIII/Tudor era fan and , well , this wa .... interesting . The only one I watched wa the Catherine of Aragon one . And wow ... just wow . I 've seen bad acting before , but this reached new height . When the actress who played Catherine wa umm .. cry ? she wail and scream and i have to admit i rewinded many time ... many , many time .... funny , funny stuff . The only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent wa the actress playing Anne Boleyn ( i might be prejudiced though , i do have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn , she wa a really facinating woman , read up on her , it 's worth it ! ) Also , i have read a lot about the Tudor time period and i think that the character were n't very acurately displayed , they were all very stereotypical . Only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period , and the important life of those involved turned into a laughing stock .",0
"It is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie . Imagine King Kong being recast a an organ grinder 's monkey and Fay Wray 's part being played by a young boy . How about Elton John a Rambo ! ! ! ! .This movie is even worse than the TV remake of The Night of the Hunter . By using the title Watchers and Dean Koontz 's name the maker of this movie should be sued for fraud by reader of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book . Read the book , I have never talked to anyone who did n't like it . Another good book is The Winner by David Baldachi .",0
"Must have to agree with the other reviewer . This ha got to be the WORST movie , let alone western I have ever seen . Terrible acting , dialogue that wa unimaginative and pathetic ( let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s ) , and oh , did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the character ? I wa waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene . And the ending ? The least I can say is that it wa consistent with the rest of the movie ... completely awful . And yes , it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable `` let 's remember when '' shot when a main character dy . Luckily I saw this on free TV . Do n't waste your time .",0
"In KPAX Softley brush on the subtlety of Eastern Religious Mores from the small archetype embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of Prot . Spacey ( Prot ) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film - it is a if the statement he make embody general truth about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in Buddhism and Hinduism . It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is 'bright ' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else see , but Prot see truth - he see the minute - and appreciates it and at some point fear it a he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly . The film is particularly detailed , therefore I would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how Softley interjects nuance . Listen carefully to the narrative at the beginning and end a they truly touch on concept not commonly presented in western philosophy . 9 of out 10 rating - Superb - with nominal room for improvement .",1

"I thought Rachel York wa fantastic a `` Lucy . '' I have seen her in `` Kiss Me , Kate '' and `` Victor/Victoria , '' a well , and in each of these performance she ha developed very different , and very real , characterization . She is a chameleon who can play ( and sing ) anything ! I am very surprised at how many negative review appear here regarding Rachel 's performance in `` Lucy . '' Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critic seem to have missed the point of her portrayal . So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel doe n't really look like Lucy . My response to that is , `` So what ? '' I wa n't looking for a superficial impersonation of Lucy . I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown . And Rachel certainly gave u that , in great depth . I also did n't want to see someone simply `` doing '' classic Lucy routine . Therefore I wa very pleased with the decision by the producer and director to have Rachel portray Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skit - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory . ( It seems that some of the reviewer did n't realize that these two scene were meant to be rehearsal sequence and not the actual skit ) . This approach , I thought , gave an innovative twist to sketch that so many of u know by heart . I also thought Rachel wa terrifically fresh and funny in these scene . And she absolutely nailed the routine that were recreated - the Professor and the Grape Stomping , in particular . There wa one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachel 's mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember Lucy having . I could n't believe she wa able to capture that - and so naturally . I wonder if many of the folk who criticized the performance were expecting to see the Lucille Ball of `` I Love Lucy '' throughout the entire movie . After all , those of u who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what Lucy wa really like in her early movie year . I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that wa brilliant . She planted all the right seed for u to see the clown just waiting to emerge , given the right set of circumstance . Lucy did n't fit the mold of the old studio system . In her frustrated attempt to become the stereotypical movie star of that era , she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gift . I believe that Rachel deftly captured the comedy , drama , wit , sadness , anger , passion , love , ambition , loyalty , sexiness , self absorption , childishness , and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon . And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that wa totally endearing . `` Lucy '' wa a star turn for Rachel York . I hope it brings a flood of great role her way in the future . I also hope it brings her an Emmy .",1
"I have to say the first I watched this film wa about 6 year ago , and I actually enjoyed it then . I bought the DVD recently , and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it . The acting wa awful , and a usual we have the stereo-typical clansman in their fake costume . The acting wa awful at best . Tim Roth did an OK job a did Liam Neeson , but I 've no idea what Jessica Lange wa thinking . The plot line wa good , but the execution wa just poor . I 'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the film . Braveheart wa even worse though , which is this film only saving grace . But seriously , people did n't speak like that in those day , why do all the actor have to have Glaswegian accent ? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotype . I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans , and to be honest I can see why they 'd like it , I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts . However , if you are thinking of buying the DVD , I 'd say spend your money on something else , like a better film .",0

"Lovely Candace Bergen a the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one dashing Sean Connery . The incident come during 1904 a Theodore Roosevelt run for election to the presidency in his own right . Needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the United States , Brian Keith a Roosevelt issue a stunning declaration to the Sultan of Morocco , `` Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead . '' But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story . The Perdicaris in question wa in reality one Ion Perdicaris who wa a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy . In fact Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship year ago and wa back a a Greek national . Never mind that though , his predicament wa serviceable enough at the time . The damsel in distress make better screen material though so it 's a widow woman and her two kid that are in harm 's way here . Of course a presented here the incident is also used by some of our European power to get their foothold into Morocco . The intrigue get far beyond one brigand 's demand for ransom . The Wind and the Lion is hardly history . But it is an enjoyable film and Sean Connery is always fun to watch . Brian Keith also fit my conception of Theodore Roosevelt and the scene in the Roosevelt White House do ring true to all the story told . John Huston play the ever patient Secretary of State John Hay who Roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor William McKinley . But kid do n't use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the Theodore Roosevelt era .",1

Usually road trip movie have great music , but I ca n't even recall whether there wa music . The only high point wa a small role with Rip Torn a a wise old hitchhiker/guru .

"Sharky 's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds best effort . It also stand a one of the best contemporary crime drama . Erotic and violent , the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in Atlanta , and delivering a chaotic detective case , to you ( the viewer ) , on a silver platter . Dedicated and determined , Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe , a lovely lady of the night , who 's clientel is anything but ordinary . Before long , Sharky 's crimefighting Machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order , which threatens to corrupt the inner body of Atlanta . As a resident of Metro Atlanta , I recall the excitement in town during the movie 's production . Sharky 's Machine go to great length to give an accurate portrayal of Atlanta . Twenty year removed and 2,000,000-more people later , the film stand the test of time . Trust me , Atlanta ha not changed . One of the highlight of the picture is Dar Robinson 's daring stunt ( a classic , symbolic ending ) . It wa even featured on That 's Incredible , ABC 's reality show of the period . It 's just too bad that Hollywood doe not make enough film like this one . Kick back , each your popcorn , and watch sterling silver cinema action .",1
"Winchester '73 is a great story , and that 's what I like about it . It 's not your everyday western -- it us a rifle , which pass hand from various character -- a a mechanism for telling the story about these people .

It 's important to note for those politically correct type -- they kill a lot of indian in this movie without remorse . By today 's standard , it 's still pretty violent . But it 's a great story and worth watching . Enjoy !",1
"Peak Practice wa a British drama series about a GP surgery in Cardale  a small fictional town in the Derbyshire Peak District  and the doctor who worked there . It ran on ITV from 1993 to 2002 , and wa one of their most successful series at the time . It originally starred Kevin Whately a Dr Jack Kerruish , Amanda Burton a Dr Beth Glover , and Simon Shepherd a Dr Will Preston , though the roster of doctor would change many time over the course of the series . The series wa axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main character plunged off a cliff . Viewers wrote to ITV in their thousand and a petition for one last episode wa set up by website Peak Practice Online . However , all plea were unsuccessful and ITV said they would not make any more episode . Peak Practice wa replaced by Sweet Medicine , another medical series set in Derbyshire . It lasted a few episode before it wa dropped from the schedule . Cardale wa based on the Derbyshire village of Crich , and the series wa filmed there and at other nearby Derbyshire town and village , most notably Matlock and Ashover . After the end of this programme , ITV attempted to launch a follow-up series called Sweet Medicine , which extended the story of different character from the original show .",1

She will do everything to make her marriage work , including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation . And thus beneath the vicey exterior , she reveals a rather sweet value system . The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feel wholly inadequate , with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then I woke up ' .

She and Fumiko ( another childhood friend ) then learn that Sayori 's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic . Already the bond between the dead and living are getting weak and the friend and villager are seeing ghost . Nothing wa exceptional or even very good about this movie . Unlike stellar J-horror film , the suspense doe n't really build , the result doe n't seem overly threatening and the ending border on the absurd . This movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy . Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurant or cook your own white rice a little too long . You end up eating it , because you need it with the meal , because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice , but it almost ruin the meal because of the gluey , gooey tastelessness of it all . 3/10 http : //blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",0
"This dreadful film assembles every Asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package . Money grubbing , devious Japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman Pat Morita to recover industrial secret in Detroit . Here he encounter a down at heel Jay Leno , who promptly refers to a murder victim a a Jap and call Morita Tojo . It 's all downhill from there .",0
"`` Gypsy '' is possibly the greatest musical ever written , so it 's too bad that it 's film version wa such a disappointment . To make up for that , we have this re-make which , if not flawless , is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical . The script is completely accurate , all the song included , and the staging remains close to the original Jerome Robbins ' staging . Bette Midler is a deft choice for Rose , her singing and personality Merman-esquire , and her acting splendid . Peter Reigert is a fine Herby , if not a great singer , and Cynthia Gibb is a straight forward , natural Louise . In truth , a live taping of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly might have been a better idea , if only because `` Gypsy '' is simply more exciting on stage , But this film is a fine translation of a great musical .",1
"Unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minute . The Plot - Even for a Seagal film , the plot is just stupid . I mean it not just bad , it barely coherent . The Acting - Unbelievably wooden . Literally seen better acting in porno 's . Ironically this film try to cash in on this audience which a 'lesbian love scene ' which is utterly cringe-worthy . Special Effects - would n't look out of place in a 60 's sword and sorcery flick . Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cure , do n't make the same mistake a i did and buy this DVD , a you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .",0
"When I first saw it 9 year ago , when I wa 9 . I thought it stunk . I 'm 18 now and I still think it stink . I mean geez no Special effect or anything , it wa boring and kinda anti-climatic . My cousin watched once and George Takai ( Sulu ) kept talking about how it wa supposed to be so much better , but they kept cutting to the budget . It would have been a great episode , but it wa a terrible movie .",0
"Saw a screener of this before last year 's Award season , did n't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended , but whatever , maybe for exposure , at the least , but the movie wa a convoluted mess . Sure , some part were funny in a black humor kind of way , but none of the character felt very real to me at all . There wa not one person that I could connect with , and I think that is where it failed for me . Sure , the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology , WOW ! What a grand idea ... let 's see if that already ha n't been mined to the point of futility . The whole ordeal feel fake , from the lighting , the casting , the screenplay to the horrible visual effect ( which is supposed to be intentional , I can tell , and so can everyone else , no one is laughing with you though ) . Anyways , I hope it make it out for sale on DVD at least , I would n't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed . But it 's tripe either way . Boring tripe at that .",0
"Read Eric 's review again . He perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than I ever could . I 'm only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it . I saw it many year ago on TV , the IFC I think . It is such a unique film I hesitate to make comparison . It wa filmed in northern Mexico , somewhere in the relentless badlands of Coahuila/Zacatecas/San Luis Potosi . This is n't the Sedona-like Durango , Mexico ( of the John Wayne film ) but a truly stark and wild place . I have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story . Like the location , this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone . It is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film . I had n't actually forgotten this movie , it is indelible . Yet , over the year , I had forgotten of it existence . I know nobody who ha seen it , had never read of it , nor seen any reference to it . Erendira is such an unusual name , I 'd even forgotten the title . Well , I 'll be looking to buy a copy now . * * I have since the above posting become a huge fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret not having read him before . Relative to MsMyth 's comment below ; the movie wa filmed in Mexico but the author is Colombian and wa not commenting on Mexico or Mexican history in any way , although Marquez now life in Mexico for `` political '' reason . This story is universal . I am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library . Liked the movie ? You have to read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote . And , by the way , the original location in the story wa Colombia .",1
"This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage , that no doubt want to be a Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) clone . The poster for this movie make it look like there 's going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy , which is likely to attract movie-goers . There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie . It just make me sad , just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers ( 1988 ) on video or DVD , and waste their time with this sad , cynical , depressing movie . Angela Baker ( Pamela Springsteen ) is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills , who hope that the other camper are a nice a she is , and that they stay out of trouble . Meanwhile , the other camper are realizing that people are disappearing one by one , with Angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home . Could Angela be the killer , who wa once a man , who underwent a sex change operation year earlier ? Who know ? Who care ? The 1980s wa home to a lot of movie that made the cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager genre , in which a mad killer go berserk . Some have a plot , some do n't , but they 're all about a bad a this one . Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers is 80 minute of teenager being introduced and then being stabbed , strangled , impaled , chopped up , burned alive , and mutilated . That 's all this movie is . It is just mindless , bloody violence . Watching this movie , I wa reminded of the Friday the 13th movie , in which the message for it viewer wa that the primary function of teenager is to be hacked to death . The filmmaker of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed of themselves . Imagine the sick message that this movie offer for it teen viewer : `` The world is a totally evil place , '' this movie tell you , `` and it 'll kill you . It doe n't matter what your dream or your hope are . It doe n't matter if you have a new boyfriend , or a new girlfriend . It doe n't matter what you think , what you do or what your plan for the future are . You can forget those plan , because you 're just going to wind up dead . '' And the sickest thing is -- and by not giving too much away -- the movie simply set up room for a sequel . Well , why not ? They 've probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movie . I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp ( 1983 ) , and , after watching it first sequel , I will hopefully stay away from the other sequel , a well a the original . And for parent , if you know kid who actually LIKE this movie , do not let them date your child .",0
"This is the worst movie that I have ever seen . At first i thought that it wa going to be good because I 'm interested in the bermuda triangle , but instead it wa terrible . All it did wa offer a bunch of lame explinations that did n't make sense ( if time move differently there how come the woman did n't age , and her son aged rapidly ) , and have a horrible sappy ending . Next time the guy who made this go to Bermuda they should take all copy of this movie with them . Please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list .",0
"Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT ( 1955 ) : the first half is deadly dull , even dreary - but the latter stage improve considerably with the scene involving the rampaging 'monster ' . In the accompanying featurette ( a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minute , when compared to the one created for the other title in Criterion 's `` Monsters & Madmen '' set ) , director Day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - try to justify the film 's shortcoming by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with ( where all the outer space scene were composed of stock footage ! ) ... and I 'd have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had I not recently watched CALTIKI , THE IMMORTAL MONSTER ( 1959 ) - a similar ( and similarly threadbare ) but far more stylish venture from Italy ! Bill Edwards a the cocky but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular feat - is positively boring at first , but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical feature are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood ! Marshall Thompson a his commanding officer and elder brother is O.K . a a leaner Glenn Ford type ; he had previously starred in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE ( 1958 ) , another ( and more successful ) Richard Gordon-produced sci-fi which , incidentally , is also available on DVD through Criterion . Italian starlet Marla Landi , struggling with the English language , make for an inadequate female lead ; even her input in the featurette prof to be of little lasting value ! The Audio Commentary is yet another enjoyable Tom Weaver/Richard Gordon track where , among many thing , the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE wa intended a a double-feature with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD ( 1958 ) is brought up - but it wa eventually put out a a standalone release , so a to exploit the topical news value of the current space race ; it 's also mentioned that the monster dialogue wa actually dubbed by Bonar Colleano ( who , tragically , died in a traffic accident prior to the film 's release ! ) . Weaver even recall a couple of anecdote from the time when he wa involved in the production of the DVD featurette shot by , of all people , ex-cult-ish film-maker Norman J. Warren : Landi , who by then had become a lady of title , wa still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flight of stair ! ; Edwards wa supposed to have contributed to the featurette but , once in London , he proved reluctant to co-operate with Weaver - eventually , the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and , in fact , he died in 2002 !",0
"( This ha been edited for space ) Chan-wook Park 's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify . Nominally a horror movie , the central character is a vampire , the film actually ha element of comedy , theology , melodrama , cultural invasion ( and it analog of viral invasion of a body ) , romance and few other thing a well . It 's a film that ha almost too much on it mind . The film take it own matter and mix them with classic European literature , in this case Emile Zola 's `` Thérèse Raquin '' . It 's an odd mix that doe n't always gel , but none the le ha an incredible power . Here it is almost 24 hour since I saw the film at Lincoln Center ( with a post film discussion by the director ) and I find my cage is increasingly rattled . Its not so much what happens is bothersome , it more that it wide reaching story and it theme ring a lot of bell in retrospect . The plot of the film ha a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease . Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dy , but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood ( it not explained ) he actually survives . Hailed a a miracle worker the priest return to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick . Unfortunately all is not well . The priest find that he need blood to survive . He also find that he ha all of the typical problem of a vampire , and it no not possible for him to go out during the day . Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family . The priest , some of his animal passion awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend . From there it all go sideways . An ever changing film , this is a story that spin through a variety of genre a it tell the very human story of a man who find that his life ha been radically altered by a chance event and find that he is no longer who he thought he wa . It 's a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else . Its also a film that ha a great deal on it mind and the theme it playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of way The film ha enough going on that one could , and people probably will , write book discussing the film . The two of the strongest part of the film are it vampiric element and it romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant . There is something about how it lay out the ground rule and the nature of the `` affliction '' that make such perfect sense that it kind of push the old vampire idea aside . Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked . I think the fact that it played more or le straight is what is so earth shaking . Here is a vampire who just want to have a normal life . It 's contrasted with what happens later , it make clear that living an existence of hunting human really is n't going to work . Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys , rather it something else . I personally think that the film change the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible . ( The sequence where the power kick in is just way cool ) The romance is also wonderfully handled . Sure the sex scene are steamy and well done , but it 's the other stuff , the look , the talk , the gesture outside of the sex that make this special . I love the look , the quiet stare a the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act , the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected , and the mad passion of possible consummation . This is one of the great screen romance of all time . It perfectly capture the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love ( and lust ) . If you 've ever loved deeply I 'm guessing you 'll find some part of your hear on screen , I know I did . The statement `` I just wanted to spend eternity with you '' ha a sad poignancy to it . It 's both a statement of what wa the intention a well a the depth of emotion . The tragic romance will break your heart . I wo n't lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great . Its not , a good a the piece are and almost all of them are great ( especially the actor who I have unjustly failed to hail a amazing ) the whole doe n't always come together . The various genre , thematic element and tone occasionally grate against each other . Frequently I wa wondering where the film wa going . I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly . I liked the film a great deal . I loved the piece more than the film a a whole . Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it , and I 'm guessing that it will do so for several day more . Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it ha so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for day afterward . One of the meatiest and most filling film of the year .",1
"The idea behind this movie wa great . The story of a little girl facing abuse ( both emotional and physical ) and trying to deal with it and survive . What make the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice over and the corny dialog . The actor have to point out the most obvious thing over and over again . Also , there is very tedious , almost funny , overuse of metaphor in the voice over . The high point is the acting of the little girl . Nice try , but this one 's a stinker .",0
"I watch them all . It 's not better than the amazing one ( _Strictly Ballroom_ , _Shall we dance ? _ ( Japanese version ) , but it 's completely respectable and pleasingly different in part . I am an English teacher and I find some of the ignorance about language in some of these review rather upsetting . For example : the `` name should scream do n't watch . 'How she move . ' Since when can movie title ignore grammar ? '' There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar . It 's just not Canadian standard English grammar . Comments about the dialogue seem off to me . I put on the subtitle because I 'm a Canadian standard English speaker , so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it . It wa n't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour a the other step movie I have seen were so American . I loved that this movie wa set in Toronto and , in fact , wish it wa even more clearly set there . I loved that the heroine wa so atypically cast . I enjoyed the stepping routine . I liked the driven Mum character . I felt that many of the issue in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movie . In summary , if you tend to like dance movie , then this is a decent one . If you have superiority issue about the grammar of the English standard you grew up speaking , your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie .",1
"Dear God ! I kept waiting for this movie to `` get started '' ... then I waited for it to redeem itself ... and when it did neither , I just sat there , dumbfounded that : 1 ) it could possibly be this bad , and 2 ) that I had just wasted a couple of hour on just sheer stupidity . I had faith that Drew could n't possibly have made this bad of a movie ... and boy , did I ever lose my faith ! Do n't bother with this one ! Drew tried , but the movie wa poorly written , poorly acted , and just poorly conceived ! I ca n't believe a script this bad ever got funded ! It had a million chance to actually do something with the idea , ( the word `` concept '' is too big for this movie to even qualify for ! ) and it STILL did n't go anyplace ! Its just pitiful ! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wa n't the worst , baffle me ! Because believe me , if it got any worse I 'd have slit my wrist before finishing it !",0
"First , let me start off by saying this film SOUNDED very interesting : A serial killer copycatting the work of Edgar Allan Poe ( who is one of my writer of all time ) . Sounds cool , right ? Yeah , definitely not . Probably the worst film I 've ever seen . Ever . And that 's not an exaggeration . I 've seen a lot of very , very bad movie . This one take the cake . And I wa even prepared for a bad movie before going into it . Perhaps the writer should 've studied some law enforcement procedure : If you have the name of the killer , his entire life 's history , a criminal record , and HIS ADDRESS , where is the first place you should look ? Hmm . . . possibly . . . his house ? What ? ! NO ! That 's a preposterous idea , Anthony ! How could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley ? * spoiler end * Honestly , sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad , or vice versa . . . but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find . I think my biggest pet peeve wa how the police/FBI acted . For example : Black FBI Agent : `` Okay , endangered female , just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be . Sound good to you ? '' Moronic Female FBI Agent : `` Yeah , sound a-okay to me . Go right ahead . I 'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter . '' Black FBI Agent : `` Excellent , that 's what I would do ! '' Honestly , if you want to be in law enforcement , rent this movie so you can learn how not to act . . . or if you 're a human and want to learn the same . 0.5/10 : A half-point just for getting a film produced and in store . Congrats . -AP3-",0
"Billy Crystal co-wrote , co-produced and star in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about father and son , adult irresponsibility , and growing old . Billy play a heart surgeon who ha a heart attack ( ha ha ) which cause him to seek out his estranged father ( Alan King ) , a movie-extra who fancy himself a big star . The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-liner galore , a flat , inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler ( stuck in sitcom mode ) , and family-conflict at the ready . Crystal and King try their best , but King is over-eager and frequently over-the-top . JoBeth Williams ha another one of her thankless role , but manages to bring her innate , down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character . It 's a comedy , I guess , but one that blink back the tear ... shamefully . * * from * * * *",0
"I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone . He 's one of my favorite actor and he rarely fails to deliver . I 'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly : it 's about a little boy who is about to be born , but a his mother go into labor , he refuse to come out ! This sends God and the whole human being factory into a crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born . So Finney take the unborn boy for an adventure in the Big Apple in hope of showing him all the reason he should want to live . Despite the ridiculousness of the plot , I could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical Hollywood sentimental moralistic message film . Directorially , the film wa rendered unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of the stock sentimental music that Hollywood director seem incapable of resisting . He further butchered the somewhat unconventional story by giving away it hand at every moment . Whatever twist and turn were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story unraveled . It wa a if the director assumed the audience is just a bunch of idiot who can not see the obvious hint coming from a mile away . Even Finney in his performance , though satisfactory , seemed a bit awkward and out of place ; and the little boy with curly lock , though he wa supposed to be cute , wa in fact rather dull . Bridget Fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate Demi Moore 's performance in 'Ghost ' , shedding tear at a moment 's notice . I understand that the film ha been unsuccessful thus far at getting distribution in the U.S. , which surprise me a I think it ha the box office potential to be a modest hit , appealing to both kid and sentimental adult . As far a the quality go , it 's not an awful film , it 's just not very good . ( 4 out of 10 )",0
"An astronaut get lost in deep space and find himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien-outlaws . This incredible plotted and enjoyable TV-installment come along a a positive birth-fantasy . The individual character , in conflict at the beginning of the series , have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last . Most of the action take place inside the womb of Moia , the living space-ship ( who even get pregnant and give birth to another ship ! ) . While science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasies ( watch the 'Alien'-movies for example , especially the fourth part 'Resurrection ' ) this come a a surprise . Also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human ( and alien ) body . One of the female character who is actually a plant experience 'photogasms ' while being exposed to sunlight . The crew even ha to go to the toilet . Would n't that be impossible in 'Star Trek ' ?",1
"This is a film that can make you want to see it again . I especially , liked the way it ended . I did not see the end coming , but when Laws wa not blown away the first time , one suspect he will be back again . The story is gripping and could have been more psychological , but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action wa necessary for that . Hard to believe Michael Jr. could be so apparently unmoved a his younger brother and mother a blown away . But , I can appreciate the scene play could n't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell . Some have complained about Hanks a a gangster . I believe that is n't justified . If his character had been any harder , he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not . Eight Stars for this one . Although it wa released in 2002 , I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD .",1
"I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty year ago . Perhaps the long wait wa worth it , since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive . In it outline this movie follows the time-worn script : a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault , the heist take place , a small seemingly insignificant event lead to the ultimate demise of all . Even though the heist footage is transfixing , it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film . This film separate itself from the typical heist movie by giving u insight into the personality of the character and their motivation - it play a much a a drama a it doe a thriller . Relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on , giving u two movie for the price of one . John Servais play the idea man Tony le Stéphanois ( always referred to a `` le Stéphanois '' ) with such world-weariness that he could have just stepped out of a Camus novel . Tony ha just recently gotten out of jail and resists re-entering the life of crime until he ha a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover ( who ha taken up with another man ) where , a punishment , he physically whip her with a belt . Thankfully that scene occurs off camera , but you are not likely to forget it . After that sobering event , since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship , Tony meet with two of his old partner in crime , Jo and Mario , and decides to join them in one last big heist . They enlist the service of Cesar , an Italian safe cracker - played by director Dassin himself - and we are off to the heist . The heist go off without a hitch . But Cesar 's womanizing bent is a personality trait that turn out to be fatal for all concerned . However , we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he ha fallen for , since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it ha to be one of the most memorable scene from any noir film . It is established early on that Tony ha a close relationship with Jo and his family ; in fact Jo 's son refers to him a uncle . I think it is partly to help Jo 's family that Tony agrees to the heist . The ending scene , where Tony save the life of Jo 's kidnapped son , partially redeems his more brutal and amoral action . But only partially .",1

"I have not read the book that this wa based upon/inspired by . This being some of ( the others are film role ) the last work of John Ritter ( RIP ) , one hope that it is hilarious . And it is . Almost every time he 's present in this , a a matter of fact . Most of the cast , supporting a well a regular , play off each other well , and the material tends to be great . He play Paul Hennessy , the father of three teenager : Rory , the typical guy of that age , Kerry , the depressive middle-child who fight for cause and awareness , and Bridget , the fashion-loving , popular ditz . Sagal make a return to being the female lead in a sit-com , and her character is far removed from Peggy Bundy . The show changed somewhat after Mr. Three 's Company passed on , and for a while , they could n't seem to make up their mind if they wanted to go for getting laugh , or being poignant and making sure to be respectful . One can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that : It could still be quite good , some of the addition were fortunate ( if you like David Spade , most of his part consists of him doing his schtick ) and had stuff to say . My personal favorite episode is in the last season . The humor is a nice mix of `` dumb person '' joke ( mainly related to the high-schoolers ) , silliness , dark comedy and crude material . This dealt with sex and other adult topic , but never in a graphic manner . The language is mild , and , on occasion , moderately strong . I recommend this to any fan of those who made it . 8/10",1
"Brilliant thriller , deserving far more fame , Mitchum and Ryan are awesome in their starring role , a is the entire supporting cast . A truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully image and some great dialogue , at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding . Based on a novel concerning homophobia , this movie attack post-war anti-emitism , and all intolerance and hatred , with considerable power . Though part may seem a little preachy to modern audience , it still ha the power to shock , and work very well a a thriller in it own right . A credit to all involved .",1
"I saw this movie a few year ago and wa literally swept away by it . So charming and so very romantic . David Duchovny and Ms. Driver have chemistry that is so hot , you will need to take off a layer of clothing . The supporting cast is 100 % top notch . Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play off one another is pure poetry . Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the film most charming moment are when they are on the screen . Like Jim Belushi screaming at his child to go to sleep `` FOREVER ! '' or him dancing in the kitchen . This film made we wish I knew people like that in my own life . Not to mention , what woman doe not want David Duchovny for a boyfriend ?",1
"I just watched this movie on Bravo ! and it wa absolutely horrible . It ha the plot of a Shannon Tweed movie without the nudity . The premise wa interesting enough , a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reason why they want the money . The character were trite a were the observation on human nature and greed . For a movie called Class Warfare it had very little to do with class difference other than the first 20 minute and the predictable ending . This movie could have done a lot better if there had been more character with motivation to get the ticket and wa a `` who done it ? '' The acting wa n't fantastic but it 's hard to seem believable with such a terrible script . Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I 'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script . She 's probably the only reason why I sat through the whole movie .",0

What transpires when the group , which includes four teenager , two preteen and two younger child , make one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for Carrie and Jim . The fight between the kid ( and one little love affair between two of them ) make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along . More interesting than the Brady Bunch , what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hour . Recommended a a feel good movie for all age .",1
"As a fan of Henriksen ( I liked him in the `` Millennium '' series ) and of course Lorenzo `` Renegade '' Lamas , I had expected at least SOMETHING from this film . Sadly , the plot is predictable , the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunt do n't work out . Sometimes it even look like they 've captured some shot from Microsoft Flight Simulator . The cinematography suck a well . Unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts ( from the cheesy dialogue ) and give the film a cheap , made-for-video-look . It work in hiphop-movies and Jet Li movie , but seems out of place in this flick . I would have liked this film 10 year ago . I wa 11 then .",0
"In theory , film should be a form of entertainment . While this excludes documentary and other experimental form of film-making ; most movie , specially genre film , must not only tell it 's story or message , they must entertain their target audience in some way . All this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production value or low-budget , a bad movie is one that is boring . `` Hellborn '' or `` Asylum of the Damned '' a is known in the U.S. , is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving , and irremediably boring and tiresome . While it ha a very good premise , it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doe n't make thing better . On another hand the film probably could had been a fine or even classic B-movie , but here it is just a bad attempt at film-making . Director Philip J. Jones tell the tale of James Bishop ( Matt Stasi ) , a young psychiatry resident , who just got his dream job at St. Andrew Mental Hospital ; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret . After the mysterious death of some patient and the constant rumor of satanic practice , James decides to find out what is going on ; only to find the incredulity of his bos , Dr. McCort ( Bruce Payne ) , who belief that Bishop is going a insane a his patient . While the premise is quite interesting , the execution of the film leaf a lot to be desired . In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller , Jones go for the easy way out and make a movie filled with every cliché of the genre . Of course , there are lot of great movie that are also filled with clichés ; but in `` Hellborn '' every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep thing moving , resulting in a boring and predictable storyline . The acting is quite mediocre for the most part , with one big exception : Bruce Payne give a top-notch performance that make the movie look unworthy of such good acting . Matt Stasi is very weak a the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performance . Despite all this flaw , one thing ha to be written about `` Hellborn '' ; it ha a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big-budget Hollywod `` horror '' production . Also , the make-up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the design for the main antagonist are quite good . Sadly , the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated , making a huge contrast with the make-up & prosthetics . `` Hellborn '' is a movie with a few good thing outnumbered by it serious flaw with terrible result . Hardcore horror or b-movie fan may be interested by it premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience . 3/10",0
"Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends bride poisoned orchid on their wedding day , steal the body in his fake ambulance/hearse and take it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juice in order to keep Bela 's wife eternally young . Some second rate actor playing detective try to solve the terrible , terrible mystery . Bela Lugosi ham it up nicely , but you can tell he needed the money . This film is thoroughly awful , and most of the actor would have been better off sticking to waiting table , but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous . Tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film . I got the DVD in a discount store 2 for £1 , which I think is a pretty accurate valuation , anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind .",0
"What the hell wa this ? I 'll admit there were some scene that caught my eye such a the 23 bullshit where the protagonist see or calculates the number 23 everywhere he go , but that wa pretty much the movie in a nutshell ? ! For cry out loud this wa supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled a a psychological thriller I would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get ? We just got something a shitty a an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption . Kinda like an old-man flick if you ask me . I probably should have just rented Wild Hogs , it would n't have made a difference . I mean who are we kidding , they should have made someone else the killer of that girl . By juxtaposing Sparrow with the protagonist of that book The number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewer by hinting that he wa the killer all along . How would that have shaken our head ? Shame on all of you voter who chose to show some generosity towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critic who concurred with my reaction .",0
"I have to say that this miniseries wa the best interpretation of the beloved novel `` Jane Eyre '' . Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable a Rochester and Jane . I 've seen other version , but none compare to this one . The best one for me . I could never imagine anyone else playing these character ever again . The last time I saw this one wa in 1984 when I wa only 13 . At that time , I wa a bookworm and I had just read Charlotte Bronte 's novel . I wa completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember not missing any of the episode . I 'd like to see it again because it 's so good . : - )",1

"My roommate and I have another friend that work at a local Blockbuster Video . He find truly awful movie for u and tell u about them . One of them wa a `` Christmas Horror '' film starring former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg a a killer Satna Claus . We did n't watch it immediately , but we did n't think there could be anything worse . Apparently , we were wrong . We were shown this slasher film `` starring '' Ken Shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow . At first we thought Ken would actually BE the killer scarecrow , and that 's why we wanted to watch , but he wa n't , and that made the movie even worse . What absolutely RUINED the movie wa the teen drama . If you want to save your brain cell from trying to escape from your head , NEVER EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE .",0
"This movie seemed like it wa put together very quickly in both plot and graphic . My two daughter were ready to go 30 minute before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theater . This wa a Nickelodeon Production and it would have been better if they had released it on the t.v . station . The animation itself in some part wa o.k . but the plot wa horrible . A classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a father expectation is used in a lot of kid movie , but the animation or graphic need to be really good to keep a child attention . This wa not the case with this film . There were also awkward element between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without .",0
"This review is for the extended cut of this movie . I first watched Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many year ago . I always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive review of it to get the general idea . That being said . I 've always found the storyline a bit confusing . The movie is , after all , a love story . And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene . Well , in the extended version this is no longer so . The old `` original '' version begin off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version . The opening sequence is Dragon ( Jackie Chan ) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around . Other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story make a lot more sense when you watch it . The pacing is also better and overall it just work better . It feel more like a love story and doe n't leave you asking question about why it end so drastically and dramatically a the regular version doe . I suggest everyone who is a Hong-Kong cinema , or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it wa originally intended . ( Or at least that 's how I think it wa intended . Why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scene ) When I wa done watching it , I felt like I had watched a completely new Jackie Chan movie although most of the sequence were the same .",1
"Detective Tony Rome ( Frank Sinatra ) return to the screen after his self titled debut , this time it 's a film that 's played for erm laugh . While on a diving trip , Rome find the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea , her foot a you might expect , encased in cement . Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky . Rome find himself immediately at risk a he ha to investigate some mafia type , who turn the table on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect , he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone . The portly Sinatra try hard to sell u the lame joke and make u believe he is a good detective , oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch , but he fails miserably , in this ham fisted vanity project . The frankly laughable denouement that surround every female is quite astounding , every woman in the film is a dither head , who like bending over is front of the camera , Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the crack of their ass each time a they flex their posterior muscle . There 's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggar belief , this wa a film made by `` real men '' for `` real men '' to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality , it 's a shameful shamble .",0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many year I wa surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p . I enjoyed the film , the twist and turn in the plot and that the file wa mainly about the main character Sinuhe make it more of a `` family saga '' rather than an action film . The costume and attention to detail wa remarkable for it time ( 1955 ) . The back projection during the chariot ride now look clumsy . My main interest wa in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion . In this film he wa portrayed a being `` Jesus '' like in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites even through they were invading Egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power . Initially one make a connection between Sinuhe , who wa cast adrift in the river Nile in a reed basket , and the Old Testament Moses . But this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a Moses like character carry Akhenaton 's monotheistic religion out to the wider world , if such a film will ever be politically possible to make . It is universally accepted that were woman are concerned we man are stupid creature but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit , the character played by Jean Simmons is hard to accept . And that Sinuhe , an educated physician , would be so smitten by Nefer the Babylonian `` femme fatal '' to the extent of giving her his adopted parent house and Tomb is not really believable , neither that his parent would even have a tomb . In real life Nefer ( Nefertitti ) wa the wife of Akhenaton . And although Horemheb did become Pharaoh it wa after a few others including Tutankhamen , who wa the son of Akhenaton . But of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus . Maybe following `` The De Vinci Code '' book and film this film be re-made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism ! I wait in great anticipation of such a film , there are already numerous book on the subject .",1
"This is an hilarious movie . One of the very best thing about it is the quality of the performance by each actor . From the largest role to the smallest , each character is vivid , unforgettable and so understandable . It can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve .",1
"Amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthology in the 70 's , and this , from leading horror scribe Robert Bloch , is one of their best effort . There are four story , all worthwhile , but two -- `` Sweets For The Sweet '' and `` Method For Murder '' -- distinguish themselves a highly effective journey into fear . In `` Sweets '' , Christopher Lee play an impatient widower whose lovely daughter ( Chloe Franks ) becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance , so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she express her distaste for his method . Franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performance in a horror film since Martin Stephens in `` The Innocents '' . This installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage , occurring off-screen , is a moment of purest horror . `` Method of Murder '' is about a horror novelist ( Denholm Elliott ) who is menaced by one of his own creation , the creepy Dominic . This episode is striking for it simplicity and stark terror . Dominic may or may not be real , so director Peter Duffell ha a great time playing with our expectation . The brief shot of Dominic reflected in a pond or seen a a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting . The original poster art , featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding Peter Cushing 's severed head , wa a rich enticement for punter fixed on fear .",1
"Let 's start from this point : This is not a movie intended for the common audience . Utterly bizarre , somehow incomprehensible , totally unpredictable , it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next . If that by itself doe n't make you agree it is an excellent movie , then go back to your `` family '' movie and forget about MOTORAMA . It ha material to be considered a cult movie , it can be placed in the same category with movie that win award in Cannes or other intellectual film festival , but , sadly , Hollywood already let if fall in oblivion , simply because it is not commercial . The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be Oscar material , but he give the right touch to the story . Even the genre is difficult to describe ; it is not a comedy in the proper sense , you do n't know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situation in which Gus get involved . It is more like an impossible adventure that some kid may wish to have , but do n't let them watch it either ... it is not a movie for kid . So , if you like Disney movie or are looking for a `` Home Alone '' style , this one is definitively not for you . But if you enjoy reading Edgar Alan Poe or the work of Tim Burton , then you will like Motorama . So , jump in your red Mustang , get a tattoo spelling `` Tora '' and cruise Strangeland with Gus . I 'd like that ...",1
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen . The story line is a joke , the effect are terrible , the cinematography doe n't fit the tone of the movie , the dialogue is cheesy , and the actor do a good job at screwing up the rest . People just do n't act that way in real life situation . My question is : Who would fund such crap ? The movie start where some miner fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them . Next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunt on their bike . One guy fall and break his leg or something . The fireman arrives to help them . Meanwhile , somebody start a fire . Some more bike stunt . Bla bla bla . I wasted my time . Do not watch this movie .",0
"The somewhat-belligerent brother of a suicide find that he and his mother grieve in much the same way ( by acting out ) but that Dad is morose and blaming himself . Writer-director Dan Harris give u a dysfunctional family torn at the seam , character with question mark hanging over them , and then lay all the story-points out in the most obvious term : Suicide ! Secrets ! Gay shame ! Family sickness ! Ultimately aiming to wrap thing up with a tidy bow , Harris want to make sure we do n't miss a trick , initially giving u thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary , sentimental fashion . Sigourney Weaver 's bemused performance a the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she 's a joy -- that is , until Harris give her a make-over ( complete with sensible new hairstyle ) . It 's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head . * * from * * * *",0
"I have n't had a chance to view the previous film , but from what I 've read on other post it wa supposedly worse than this one , although I doubt that is possible . I 'm a huge fan of the `` Zombie '' genre , and I am fascinated by the psychological aspect of viewing creature , that for all intent and purpose are human , a an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head . That said , HOTD 2 take the `` Zombie '' movie to an all new low . Without giving any big spoiler ( which I really should do just so you wo n't bother wasting your time actually watching this movie ) I would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writer of this film portray our country Special Forces . Gomer Pile could have probably survived longer than the `` Spec Ops '' soldier in this film . For cry out loud they should have called them the Special Education Forces instead . If you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombie , at least have the soldier be smarter than the walking corps . I understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team , but you can find better way to do it than having them set down their machine gun and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement . The writer actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high-tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for , and the idea ha merit , if it wa n't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making . I mean come on , zombie film are n't exactly `` high art '' , and the viewer expects some tongue-in-cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrill , but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that make you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the character . If you are a zombie movie fan like me , please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one .",0

"Last year , I fell in love with the Tim Burton 's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to check out the other version of this musical and I found this one at the library . Though I think Burton 's is best , probably because I like film a lot better than theater , this is still a great production of the story . I have n't seen any of the other version but I am trying to get my hand on them . After seeing Johnny Depp a Todd , it 's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role , but George Hearn doe a fantastic job .

"I wa very impressed with what Eddie Monroe wa able to accomplish in regard to it overall affect on me . I say this because I know this independent film had a limited budget/resources , but despite this , it come across a a convincing and well crafted piece of work . Enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actor which I ca n't help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in year to come , Eddie Monroe did n't fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing . It 's a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard . Many of the cast name listed for this film are name to look out for in the future . Someone told me that Paul Regina recently passed , and if this is true it 's a real tragedy since his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable . Kudos to Fred Carpenter who ha truly pulled out a winner with this one !",1
"This is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doe n't appear literally until half way in . Nevertheless I wa engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady . Curtis , though competent a the falsely accused Scott Henderson , look a little tough to be be sympathetic towards ( perhaps he should have shaved his moustache ) and his behavior when he first come home should have convinced the cop at least to some degree of his innocence . While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone a Jack Marlowe I found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex . He is no stock villain . Superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in top form a the 'little man with big ambition . ' His drumming in the musical number added a welcome touch of eroticism . This movie however is carried by the very capable and comely Ella Raines a the devoted would be lover of Henderson , Carol Richmond . She definitely ha talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall . This is the first of her work I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see her other role . The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent . All in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to . Recommended , 8/10 .",1

A friend of mine recommended this and i rented it , needle to say i will not be pursuing anymore recomendations from her anytime soon . This movie show the rollercoaster of drug use . The problem is , you really do n't care about any of the character due to lack of believabilty and their own self discipline .

"I 'm a 53 year-old college professor . I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter . We all enjoyed the movie . The film is original , witty , fast-paced and totally charming . The plot wa easy enough for a 10 year old to follow , but twisty enough to keep an adult interested . I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast wa just fine . My only criticism is that the Los Angeles set were not a interesting a they should have been . They were functional , but nothing stood out . On the other hand , make-up , costume , lighting , cinematography , editing and directing were excellent . Altogether , I thought it wa a totally enjoyable experience . I am disappointed that the professional critic ( almost all adult male ) savagely attacked the film . Apparently , they have something against film that portray strong , intelligent and independent young woman . Their writing reveal more about their own sexist nature than anything about this wonderful family film . I recommend it strongly to every child and every parent .",1

"This show ha to be my favorite out of all the 80 's horror TV show . Like Tales from the Darkside , also from the same creator , this show is a rare gem . If you agree with me , PLEASE sign this petition I started , to get the word out for Monsters and get it out on DVD . Here is the petition address : www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episode would have to be Glim glim , and Rain Dance . I also loved the opening intro with the monster family . That used to creep me out ! One of the thing I would have to ask the DVD creator to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be . I do n't know if any of you remember that part but that 's one of the main thing that brings back memory to me . I mean , come on ! War of the Worlds the TV series already ha been released on DVD , so I say Monsters , and also Tales from the Darkside , and Friday the 13th the series should be released too !

"This is one of the movie of Dev Anand who gave great yet distinct movie to Hindi movie industry such a Jewel thief and guide . The story is short ( if you ask me what is the story ) , plot is simple- a brother seek for his lost sister . Sister ha joined the hippy who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna . Yet the movie portrays few of the significant event that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture , their submission to drug , freedom , escaping duty , family , and adopting anything new such a eastern ( which wa new for white ) religion . They have been handled perfectly . Zeenat gave her best and Dev a usual wa remarkable . Songs are the best used ( unlike they are abused for the sake of having song ) in this movie . They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo ' . Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful . The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie . Overall Devji who doe believe in making different movie ha been successful in showing what he wanted to show here .

"Winchester 73 get credit from many critic for bringing back the western after WWII . Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction . Jimmy Stewart doe an excellent job , but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guy involved in a high stake poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner . This is a good script with several story going on at the same time . Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson a Young Bull . Thank God , with in a few year , we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western film . The film is in black and white and wa shot in Tucson Arizona . I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach , High Noon or Shane , but it get an above average recommendation from me . .",1

First , Robert Culp play an investigator for Ray Milland 's character . He hire him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair . In return , Culp 's character blackmail the cheating wife who plan to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career . Out of anger , Culp kill her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere . I do n't know . Maybe I just did n't care for this one at all . Of course , Columbo get him in the end . It 's just the question of how .",1
"Prison is not often brought up during conversation about the best eighty horror film , and there 's a good reason for that because it 's not one of the best ... but a you delve past the classic film that the decade had to offer , this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller film . The film doe have some connection to blockbuster ; for a start it 's an early directorial effort for Renny Harlin ; the capable director behind a number of action film including Die Hard 2 , Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea ; and secondly we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen . The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting . We focus on a prison that ha been reopened after a number of year . This wa the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth wa sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison 's governor . Naturally , the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace ; and when the old execution room is reopened , the spirit of the dead convict escape for vengeance . The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption , but it doe take care to build up it various character and while the main point of the film is always the horror , the prison drama behind it all doe make for an interesting base . This is a good job too because other than the basic premise , the film doe n't really have a 'plot ' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the character to keep thing interesting . The horror featured in the film is at time grotesque but it 's never over the top , which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered , being released in a decade of excess . The murder themselves are rather good and imaginative , however , and provide some major highlight . As the film go on , we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict 's ghost and while it 's fairly interesting , some thing about it do n't make sense and it drag the film down a little . Still , everything boil down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that Prison is a film well worth tracking down .",1
"Butch the peacemaker ? Evidently . After the violent beginning with Spike , Tom and Jerry all swinging away at each other , Butch call a halt and want to know why . It 's a good question . `` Cats can get along with dog , ca n't they ? '' he asks Tom , who nod his head in agreement . `` Mice can get along with cat , right ? '' Jerry nod `` no , '' and then see that is n't the right answer . They go inside and Butch draw up a `` Peace Treaty '' ( complete with professional artwork ! ) . Most of the rest , and the bulk of the cartoon , is the three of them being extremely nice to one another What a refreshing change-of-pace . I found it fun to watch . I can a million of these cartoon in which every beat each other over the head . Anyway , you knew the peace wa n't going to last . A big piece of steak spell the death of the `` peace treaty '' but en route it wa nice change and still had some of usual Tom & Jerry clever humor .",1
"like in so many movie of the past , you would think Hollywood would learn this by now , make for a very disappointing movie , not to mention , make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransom . Maybe this film want to remind of these basic fact in case it should ever happen to one of u . Why the long walk in the wood and can a city guy really go through the wood without getting lost ? Just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that wa meaningless in the end . I had to listen to part of the director 's comment in the special feature section , from the great move that Redford ha made in the past , ( Sneakers for one ) surprised he agreed to star in such a film . The director 's comment and reason were weak . The best part of this movie wa the scenery , ca n't wait for spring to come .",0
"I really wanted to write a title for this review that did n't come off a corny or gushing but still described my feeling for this show . I can see now that it is not possible . `` American Family '' is one of the best show I have ever had the pleasure of watching on television . Several reviewer here on IMDb have mentioned the word `` beautiful '' when describing this show . Never ha a word been more fitting . The cinematography for this show is stunning . Every scene and shot look like a masterpiece . The lighting , camera move , scene composition and color ... I have to keep reminding myself that I 'm watching a TV Show and not a Motion Picture masterpiece . The score by Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang brings tear to my eye . And most importantly , the acting by the all around amazing cast is honest and sincere . I do not feel like I am watching performance ... I feel like I 'm watching real life . If only real life could be this beautiful . `` American Family '' ha indeed raised the bar for quality entertainment on Television . I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it . I could easily chide CBS for passing on this show , but I have to say that it doe n't matter to me who air it . I 'm just glad it 's out there for everyone to see . So I do thank PBS for not allowing this show to disappear into nothingness . I have to give special recognition to the way each season 's finale ended . The first one wa pure creative brilliance and it moved me to tear . I wa waiting to see if season two would also end in a creative way , and sure enough it did . Again , tear . My thanks to all of those involved . You really have made a special piece of art with this show , and I sincerely mean that . It is a shame that we only got two season , but a miracle we got anything at all .",1
"I saw this film at a special screening . At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie , but I wa wrong . The movie is based on the Shakespeares book `` The Twelth Night '' This movie tell the story of a girl who life to play soccer . Well when the girl team is cut she ha to go to great length to get on the guy team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guy team at her old school . On her way she get caught up in a long tangled web of love , lie , and deception . This movie is this year Mean Girls . I think it show some great new actor ability and there are defiantly some big star to be featured in this movie .",1
"I saw this kung fu movie when I wa a kid , and I thought it wa so cool ! Now I am 26 year old , and my friend ha it on DVD ! ! ! We got a case of brew , and watched this classic ! It lost NONE of it 's original kung fu coolness ! If you are a fan of kung fu/karate movie , this is a must see ... the DVD is available . I believe this movie is also called `` Pick Your Poison '' . Watch it soon !",1
"... And there were quite a few of these . I do not like this cartoon a much a many others , partly because it wa made in it period . I much prefer cartoon with Daffy and Bugs which are fifteen or so year before-hand . Many people will like this , particularly people who always find violence funny , cartoon or not . The basic plot is a pretty well known one for Looney Tunes : Elmer go out hunting , Daffy lead him to Bugs and Daffy end up being shot instead . Also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining joke ( some do not enhance the episode ) , ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre . The plot is mainly geared by joke - each joke keep the episode going . This way of plot-going is not all that unusual in Looney Tunes ( of course if you are pretty much a Looney Tunes boffin - or an eager one - like me , then you 'll know this already ) . For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I have said about it , enjoy `` Rabbit Seasoning '' ! 7 and a half out of ten .",1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangement . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd be looking at when attending a live performance . The foot , the face , the overall view . Unfortunately , it fall a bit short . But , having said that , watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying . It 's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video . The progression of the show is evident , change from the original Dublin production are evident . `` Trading Taps '' is the highlight of the video , in my opinion . Tarik Winston is unbelievable , a is his partner in the piece . I think the audio wa better in this version than the original video production ( 1995 ) . In Dolby 5.1 on DVD it 's excellent . Despite the flawed videography , it 's a must-own for Riverdance fan .",1
"When I saw this in the cinema , I remember wincing at the bad acting about a minute or two into the first scene , then immediately telling myself `` no , this ha to get better '' . It did n't . The performance are pretty uniformly teak 'n pine and no , there is NO sexual chemistry in this film whatsoever , just the awkward posturing of a reasonably comely , discreetly talentless actress who seems born to grace the cover of `` Interviú '' and not much else besides . If the scriptwriter thought that making Mérimée a character wa a stunningly original creative ploy he perhaps ought to get out more . And Aranda , if he 'd given the matter a bit more thought , would have realised that the story of Carmen is just CRYING OUT for a thoughtful , iconoclastic , parodic deconstruction , not this leave-your-brains-at-the-turnstile affair of ersatz passion and comic-book dialogue . This is contemporary Spanish cinema at it worst .",0
"De Palma 's technique had hit it high maturity by the time of this film , which is a wonderful showcase of his classic technique , though unfortunately , a with many of the film written by De Palma himself , the story serf the meta more than the interest of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale . The story open with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in a shower while she look at her husband . She is then grabbed and raped while he husband stand obliviously near-and the whole thing is revealed to be Angie 's fantasy a he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed . She ha a short scene with her son , a dead ringer for Harry Potter , which concludes with a joke that `` she 'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter . '' She then go to her therapy session , where she complains about her dead marriage , before attempting to seduce her therapist , Michael Caine . He refuse , and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled . Then begin a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film . Among the many thing De Palma gleaned from Hitchcock is the understanding of film a a purely visual medium of telling story and in typical De Palma fashion , he turn this into a way to show off his formidable skill . The problem , for me , is that in this instance one begin to feel that scene are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director 's skill . The sequence begin with Angie at an art museum . She watch stranger , all involved in sexual or family activity , then begin to get turned on to a man sitting next to her . De Palma very skillfully tell an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about Angie 's attraction , embarrassment , retreating , and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab , all set to a wonderfully lush score by Pino Donaggio , who also scored Carrie . In the second part of the sequence Angie ha slept with the guy , and get up to return to her husband . Again De Palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered , a Angie realizes that she doe n't have her panty , that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is , that she ha probably contracted a venereal disease , and that she ha lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle . It 's all very admirable , but one begin to feel a little strung along a we are forced to do thing like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor , then up again , almost in real time . ... Spoilers from here on out ! When Angie reach the seventh floor again , she is killed by a big woman with blond hair . The woman hack away at her until she reach the ground floor , when the door open and Nancy Allen see her there . There is a wonderful slow-motion sequence a Nancy reach into the elevator , Angie reach up toward her , and the killer 's blade is held poised to slash Nancy 's hand . Then follow some electrifying shot a Nancy look up and see the killer in the elevator convex mirror . It 's all good , and by the time we have some dialogue again , you think ; `` Woah , that wa just 22 straight minute of purely visual narrative ! '' Or maybe you do n't , but I do . A younger Dennis Franz ha a great part a a sleazy and tough New York detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him . He Interviews Michael Caine , making the outrageous implication ( though it pass a commonplace ) that Angie WANTED to be killed . Angie 's son is there a well , and he hook up with Nancy , and they set about to spy on Caine 's therapist and find out who the killer is . Once again there is a strong tie to a Hitchcock film , in this case Psycho ( just a Obsession is a re-working of Vertigo ) . You have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut , who get killed in the first 30 minute in an enclosed space , in this case an elevator rather than a shower . Then the relative of the deceased conduct an investigation , which reveals that the killer is a man who dress a a woman to kill . De Palma even throw in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing . It is very interesting , but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around , and that is my primary reservation about this film . It is definitely essential viewing and showcase some of De Palma 's greatest setpieces , but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for De Palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasy make it hard to look back on this one with whole-hearted affection . -- - Check out other review on my website of bad and cheesy movie , Cinema de Merde , cinemademerde.com",1
"Having read many of the comment here , I 'm surprised that no one ha recognized this a basically an overlong remake of a Twilight Zone episode from 1960 called `` Mirror Image , '' starring Vera Miles . Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minute than Sean Ellis did in 88 minute with this tedious snooze . A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending , but in a feature film , there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense . Sadly , substance and sense are two thing missing from `` The Broken . '' Yes , it ha some moment , but they are not enough to justify your time . Some further observation : although this is clearly a contemporary story , not one character in the movie ha a cellphone ! And even though a car accident is the event that get the story going , there is never any reference to an insurance company , to the person who wa driving the other car , or to the police who would have been required to do a report . My advice : skip this bore and watch the original instead !",0
"Just got around to seeing Monster Man yesterday . It had been a long wait and after lot of anticipation and build up , I 'm glad to say that it came through and met my expectation on every level . True , you really ca n't expect too much from hearing the plot rundown , but after reading some of the review for it , I wa ecstatic . I mean , what trash fan would n't want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make-shift monster truck ? I went in expecting a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more . This wa a horror comedy that actually worked . The film maker got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time . Kudos to Michael Davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor . Let me list just a few reason why I love this movie so much : First off is the story . It 's been done to death in so many other flick . A college guy get wind that his childhood crush is getting married . He , being the 25 year old virgin that he is , hop in his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love , hoping that she will fall head over hill and all that good jive . Hidden in the backseat of his station wagon , is good buddy Harley . Harley is the loudmouth , former friend , who laugh and talk just like Jack Black in High Fidelity . You ca n't help but like the guy , but if he wa your friend in real life , you 'd have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy ( laugh all you want , but have you ever been hit with one ? ) to keep him in check . So , he 's a little on the obnoxious side , to say the least , but you can tell that he 's a loyal friend , deep down ... Anyway , they 're on the road and when they stop in a bar , they aggravate the local . Now they 're being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck . That 's it . Yeah , along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but I 'm too lazy and hungover to go into that right now ... so just watch the damn movie . Second thing I love wa the humor . This one had some of the sickest laugh of any movie since Cabin Fever . Just how messed up is it ? Well , I wo n't even go into the whole cat scene and a for the `` corpse burrito '' thing , I 'll leave that to your virgin eye a well . The bar full of amputee wa somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too . Harley , although a totally obnoxious frat-boy type , can really sling off the one liner . Love the clog , by the way . I need a new pair .. The GORE . This one pours it on heavy . While the first hour play out a a demented road comedy , the last third is all about blood and gut . If the movie had n't kept such a light tone throughout , it would have been a little disturbing , but seeing how it wa all played for laugh , there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it . If you 're still in your seat by the time it come , you 'll probably see the humor in it too , but seriously , there were bucket and bucket of the red stuff . There wa a big plot turn that I DID N'T see coming and when the credit rolled , I wa completely satisfied . I had gotten exactly what I came for and I 'm really glad that I bought it . Much like Cabin Fever , it 's going to get a lot of replay . The Look of the movie wa outstanding . There wa this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80 and I loved the exaggerated color . It 's obvious that Monster Man wa done on a relatively low budget , but much like Cabin Fever ( sorry I keep comparing the two ) it actually work in the movie 's favor . Cabin Fever wa an ode to the 70 great , this wa the 80 answer to that . So take that for what it 's worth . No CGI here . This is what we all needed . I 'm not exactly sure why it did n't get a theatrical release because this is everything that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been . Thank god for Lions Gate .",1
"I wa very moved by the story and because I am going through something similar with my own parent , I really connected . It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing wa once vibrant and passionate . And then there 's the mistake they made and have to live with . I loved Ellen Burstyn 's performance and who is Christine Horne ? She 's fantastic ! A real find . There is probably the most erotic scene I 've ever seen in a film , yet nothing wa shown - it wa just so beautifully done . Overall the look and feel of the film wa stunning , a real emotional journey . Cole Hauser is very very good in this picture , he humanizes a man spiraling downwards . I liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman 's life , never sentimental , never too much - just enough to hook u in , but not enough to bog down .",1

What great location . A visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens.This little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 day . Good going folk ! . I can not wait to see what your next feature will be . I 'll be with you all the way .,1
"The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns . Christopher Lee ( who ha since said that he wa duped in to appearing in this by his producer who told him load of great actor were involved ) is Father Pergado and get to do his usual serious and scary routine . The cast are not too bad , though most have now retired from acting . The film ha terrible sound effect ( mainly created from pressing key on an old computer it seems ) and it ridiculously pondering at time - showing a scene of the sky , for instance , for what feel like hour at a time . Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way and the production is adequate . Interestingly one scene feature Albert Band and wife Jackie ; Meda Band ; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band 's assistant Bennah Burton . Despite it plodding nature I genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it .",0
"Well , where do I start ... As one of the other reviewer said , you know you 're in for a real treat when you see the opening shot - minute and minute of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelator . I wo n't repeat Rubin 's excellent summary of the story . What I would like to say , though , is that this film gripped me more than any film I can remember . I sat open-mouthed , and on the edge of my seat all the way through . The camera work , sound track and * fantastic * performance ( particularly that of Tony Servillo ) draw you to the screen and wo n't let you look away . It 's Italian , so of course everyone look fantastic , but it is by no mean merely an exercise in cool style . This is a film with lot to say about luck , loss and love . Go and see it .",1
"Begotten is one of the most unique film I 've ever seen . It is more , to me , a study of sound , light and dark , and movement than a real story . The type of thing you see a a video instillation at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater . I 'm not going to try to interpret the image of the mother nature , the beast in cloak , the twisted and tortured body of her `` child '' . Some thing just defy interpretation .",1
"Although this wa a low budget film and clearly last minute , it hold a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint . I tend to believe it is the scriptwriter- Grant Morris ( see Dead Dog ) , who , despite the warped plot line injected a fantastic slice of humour , sorely missing in many of today 's box office hit . Definitely a must see for a Sunday afternoon laughfest . Speaking a a true single girl , and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly , but did ignite a small flame of hope for a lovelife . Not my lovelife , so much a my slightly crazy neighbour 's lovelife who let her hamster sleep in her bed with her . She may find someone .",1
"Darr is a great movie ! Shahrukh play an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is Juhi Chawla . Little doe Juhi know in the film that Shahrukh ha a MAJOR crush on her and is constantly stalking her . I have to admit , some of the thing he did in this movie were pretty creepy ... like the threatening phone call . Never in my life will I forget the line , `` I love you K .. k .. k .. Kiran ! '' It 's just too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi were n't exactly `` together '' in the film . But Juhi and Sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie . Though Shahrukh 's role wa pretty psychotic , I still think he did a great job of playing it and ca n't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role . No wonder he got an award for Darr in 94 ' ! Juhi ... what can I say ? ? ? She look especially amazing in this film ! It 's not that she doe n't always look amazing in her other film , but Darr did give the public a wonderful image of her ! As for the music ... it wa excellent ! Especially `` Jaadu Teri Nazar , '' one of my all time favorite song . I also thought `` Tu Mere Samne '' wa quite nice also . A must see for everyone ! Overall Darr deserves a 9/10 !",1
"It would be a shame if Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval ever see this movie a they will probably be associated with it in year to come . `` Oh yeah '' , the public will say , `` 'Comanche Moon ' , that 's the mini series about the Texas Rangers and the Comanche Indians that starred Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval . It wa a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in . I think it wa a comedy but a not very funny comedy . I really do n't understand why they agreed to be in it '' . That would be such an injustice a the original `` Lonesome Dove '' wa a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and Jones and Duval will be remembered for it .",0
"I love this movie . The cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various character . Judith Ivey did so well portraying a weak , fearful , dependent , who wa passive aggressive in her complaining and self-involved character , that it wa a relief to see the character 's metamorphosis . Blythe Danner wa equally appealing in her role a a somewhat judgmental Jewish mother , devoted wife , and loving sister . Jonathon Silmerman , Bob Dishy , Stacey Glick , and Lisa Walz performed their role equally well . If you enjoy movie that relate to going through challenging time without loosing your sense of humor and hope , you will love this movie .",1
This is one of the unusual case in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great . Maybe this is because Gorris ' take Nabokov 's initial idea and give them a different interpretation . The final consequence is a point of view over Luzhin which dignifies him more than the Nabokov 's one . The only thing in the movie which I do n't like is the influence of Valentinov 's on Luzhin 's destiny . I ca n't imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel 's argument .,1
"Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school film of the same name , this is a stylised look at Hong Kong 's triad gang . Called election because a new leader or 'chairman ' is elected by ancient tradition every two year . Two candidate are up for the position and through ego , bribe and past track record the race is tense to say the least . Expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twist and turn before revealing itself in all it brutal glory . The Asian godfather this is not , but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence . Subtitled volume 1 I think it safe to say there will other instalment a we go deeper into the murky world of the triad and all their feuding and underhand business deal . Either way this is a good start and if there are no sequel a great film in it own right .",1
"A SHIRLEY TEMPLE Short Subject . It can get mighty rough at Buttermilk Pete 's Cafe when the local contingency of diaper-clad WAR BABIES come in for their midday milk break . This primitive little film - a spoof of military movie - provides a few chuckle , but little else : tiny tot talking tough can begin to pall in a short time . Shirley Temple , playing a duplicitous hip-swinging French miss , ha n't much to do in this pre-celebrity performance . Highlight : the real sign of toddler temper when a few of the infant unexpectedly get well & truly soaked with milk . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subject were useful to the Studios a important training ground for new or burgeoning talent , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamic for creating a successful short subject wa completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in term of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subject were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature film .",1
I liked this movie a lot . It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friend over such a tragedy .

"I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through , since I had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own , but I came close many time to turning it off and just writing off the money I had paid for it . If you are a fan of gore and sadism , this movie is OK . If there is one thing that the maker of this film know , it is the creative use of fake blood and body part for a sickening effect . If that doe n't thrill you , then stay away . This movie is shot on a home video camera , with grade school prop and terrible actor . It 's dubbed from German , but even allowing for that , the sound is awful . This film is about a budget a budget get , except for the aforementioned special effect . If they had spent a little more money on actor and a real script instead of blood and gut , the film might have been a little more enjoyable . The story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadist . They are captured , and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape . I call this a story in the loosest sense , since it is really a series of scene of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog . There is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie , unless you like mindless gore . Consider yourself warned .",0

"George Saunders is a forger who steal a rare copy of Hamlet , killing a guard in the process . Months later an associate of his is selling forgery of the book for great sum of money . One of the forgery is sold to a man working for the Nazi 's . Not happy at being taken the Nazi front man insists on getting his money back , at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled client show up . The middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begin to play all side against each other and set up a meeting at the New York public library between various party , however a people begin to die , the library is locked down and more murder ( and perhaps some rare book larceny ) seem to be close to happening . Complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast ( Saunders is joined by Richard Denning and a cast of solid supporting player ) If there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plot with in plot and everyone pretty much out for themselves . The layer of theft , forgery , murder and war time intrigue ( this wa 1942 ) are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time . Still it an enjoyable little film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the character that clearly mark this a one of the first film noirs . Until Denning show up we 're down among some charming thief , whom we like , perhaps even more than the hero , but it clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending , and they know it , even if they fight it . A good little film that 's worth searching out .",1
"This is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a African-centric over the top airliner . They even portray the owner a not only being in control of the airline , but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport . One day this guy win $ 100 million dollar a the next time you see him , he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport . Everyone call this movie a parody , but nothing about this movie shout parody ! This movie is a flop and will forever be in the $ 4.95 bin at Wal-Mart . I ca n't even come to term to why MGM would waste 16 million dollar on this movie . This movie doe n't even warrant straight-to-video status . The writer ( one black and one white ) should be blackballed from Hollywood forever . Not only do they over-stereotype black , they portray them a ignorant human being . I would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me . Do n't waste your time at the video store , wal-mart , pay-per-view , or on a Sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on TBS .",0
"I 've noticed how all the other review of this film mention how `` wholesome '' and `` entertaining '' it is . These people need to get out of the house more often . I do n't know why they 're shilling for this vapid , insipid , brainless piece of fluff . Pat Boone ha absolutely no acting talent whatsoever , and his ineptness is exceeded only by that of his co-star Pamela Austin , a former model ( yet one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless model on an unsuspecting moveiegoing public , a foul habit that unfortunately persists to this day ) . A good supporting cast ( Terry-Thomas , Edward Everett Hortyon , among others ) try hard to make some sense out of this , but to no avail . I noticed that two director shared credit , although `` credit '' is n't the word I would use ( neither is `` director '' ) . As for `` wholesome entertainment , '' there are plenty of those type of movie available without torturing your loved one by forcing them to sit through this . Find one of those film , and skip this one .",0
"This movie wa an excellent acted , excellent directed and overall had an excellent story . Ive had real life experiance with a boy like 'Radio ' . At the football program in my town , weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice , travel , and have fun with the football team . This movie is really true and i can identify with it 100 % . A boy like 'Radio ' just need to feel like they belong to something ; they need to feel like their life is worth living . Thats how 'Radio ' feel and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school . This is a very touching movie that im glad ha been brought to the big screen . My dad and I loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tell a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man !",1

Well , there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver a a rally car driver . If you ca n't tell the difference , go watch it , you 'll have a blast . It really come down to this , there are really really really nice car in this movie , they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic . The acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot . If you want to see hot girl , turn on mtv or vh1 instead . I am disappointed that such nice car would be represented in such a bad movie . If the class of the car were to match that of the movie , they should be racing with rusted bicycle .",0
"Who doe n't have unresolved issue with parent ? And which parent do n't have unresolved issue with each other ? I know , that sound heavy . But this is played for laugh in the movie , making both the comedy better and the drama better . I 've always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk , and although I wa a bit concerned that their star quality might be too big for a small movie , I wa enchanted from the very first scene . Especially entertaining were the discovery that the son make about his father a a person . And Peter Falk 's monologue about being a hard-working , sacrificing father and husband wa the perfect balancing point . Without that scene being acted so well , the movie would have seemed far le nuanced , and the character far le interesting . Nicely done , Paul and Peter !",1
"Good animation , nice character design , and a light-hearted story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu enjoyable to watch . After my first viewing , I thought that this anime wa pretty good , but but wa much better on for a second watch . This is because it is done out of chronological order , and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connection you did n't see before . ( OR it may be that you see a second meaning to some event you did n't notice before ) You may want to read the original novel ( not manga ) by Tanigawa Nagaru before/after seeing this . The anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the story it show . However , there are some short story from the book that are not animated , but are referenced to . ( bamboo w/ wish attached shown in episode 14 ) Overall , this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot ( reading the book improves upon it a well ) . It is a nice break from the shounen-jump anime that seem to be taking over .",1
"A film like Crossfire put another film that spread around it social consciousness- i.e . the recent film Crash- almost to shame . Not necessarily because either one put forth it message of intolerance-is-rotten more significantly ( although I 'd wager Crash throw the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this ) , but because of how the storytelling and contrivance never get much in the way like with Crash . Maybe it 's not really necessary to compare the two , a Crossfire is in it core all deep into the film-noir vein like it going out of style . It wa interesting actually to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview , where he mentioned that the budget for the photography wa significantly lower ( on purpose ) so that more could be spent on the actor , and the schedule went through at a very brisk , quick pace . But then what come off then a being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set-ups that it took a lot to do . Just for a small scene , like when Robert Mitchum 's Keeely first go in for questioning under the Captain Robert Young- the contrast of shadow seamlessly in the room is exquisite . That there are many other lighting set-ups that go even further with so little mark this a something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period . Just take a look at a shot of character on a stairwell , the bar silhouetted against them , and see what I mean . But back to the substance part of the film- it 's really a story that consists of a murder mystery , but one that we a the audience do n't take long to figure on the answer . It 's then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that would n't be found in a common crime picture then , a there are really no 'criminals ' for the most part in the film . There 's a very calculated risk with this then that character could be too thin just to prop up the ( worthwhile ) message against anti-semitism . But Dmytryk 's direction of his top-shelf cast , along with a really terrific script by John Paxton flesh out the character , least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message . And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it ? Mitchum help that along , even in scene like between him and Young where it very much based in the situation of the story 's moment ( i.e . a detail in the plot ) , by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog . It may already be there in the line , but he help make the character with a good edge for his scene . Then there 's also Robert Ryan , who excels at Montgomery a a man who you know you do n't like much at first , just through his b.s . demeanor , but you 're not totally sure about either . Then once it start to come clearer- ironically through a subjective view-point of the suspect Mitchell ( George Cooper ) at the apartment of the soon-to-be-deceased Samuels- his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind-way . It 's a good performance when also countered with Cooper , who ha actual personal issue that he face and come forward with regret and humility . It 's really after the film end that one think about a lot of this , however , and while you 're watching the film it 's more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scene , and in the sometimes stark , overpowering camera move on the actor , so the message is in a way secondary . Not that it is n't an important one , especially for the time period ( coming right off of WW2 ) , but year later it seeing the actor , even the one that do n't get the big marquee status like Gloria Grahame a Ginny ( the femme fatale of the picture , if it could 've had time for one which it doe n't ) and William Phipps a Leroy ( the `` hick '' ) , working off one another that stick much strongly in the compacted screenplay . Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too , a for very long stretch we hear nothing , and mostly when it doe come up it 's incidental to the character 's surroundings . He could 've just a easily gone with added musical note on some dramatic scene for emphasis , most specifically the opening audience-grabber into the film . By sticking clear of that , and getting the right attitude and nuance in camera and cast , it uplift standard in genre material to a very fine , memorable level . My favorite scene would probably go to Finley 's story about an Irish immigrant he tell to Leroy , where all such element come into place well . It might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs- and I 'd still throw-down Murder My Sweet a the director 's masterpiece in this kind of picture- but it 's assuredly higher in quality than something of the B-level too .",1
"Warning Spoilers following . Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real event of the film took place . Other than that , libelous ! , scandalous ! Filmed in Canada ; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast . I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada . Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I wa at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is ; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people ! I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode wa coerced to make the USAF the hero of the film when in fact the real rescuer where a small private airline based in Calgary ; Kenn Borek Air .",0

This movie make me think the others I 've seen with Combs were an accident . The plot had more hole than I think I 've ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a `` b '' movie . The acting wa so laughable that not even the memory of Combs ' past campy triumph were enough to save it . Considering the script I have to imagine that there wa not enough money in the budget for thing like continuity and original idea . I am thoroughly upset that I paid Blockbuster price for this trash . The fact that it wa made for television wa something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movie this poor should be required to warn you of . Avoid this movie no matter what .,0
"I saw this film purely based on the fact that it wa on the DPP Video Nasty list , and while I 'm glad I saw it because it 's now 'another Video Nasty down ' - on it own merit , Andy Milligan 's film really is n't worth bothering with . There are , of course , far worse film on the infamous list ; but that doe n't make the pain of viewing this one any easier . The film wa obviously shot on an extremely low budget , and that ha translated into the script ; a Blood Rites work on an idea often seen in horror cinema , and doe n't do anything new with it . Basically , the plot centre on three couple who find themselves at a house awaiting the result of a will . It 's not long before they start getting picked off ... blah blah blah . For most of the film , nothing happens ; and then when we finally get down to the scene that justify the movie being banned , they 're so amateurish and silly that they 're impossible to take seriously on any level . It 's a very good thing that this movie doe n't have a very long running time a otherwise it could have been used a a particularly nasty method of torture . It all boil down to a fittingly tedious ending , which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportion . Apparently , this movie is still banned here in the UK ; but somehow I doubt it 's because of it shock value . Basically , Blood Rites is n't worth seeing and I personally can see no reason to recommend it . Unless , of course , you 've made it your business to see everything on the Video Nasty list ...",0
"15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata . However a the story unfolds , one realize the thin line that director try to walk between Relationships , Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia . I would say Aparna Sen is one director who ha so much more to say and ha so le time at disposal . Well no doubt she ha managed to make a good movie . In a way she make u realize that probably each one of u is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue ' . Its an unending search within each of one of u ... The powerhouse performance from Shabana Azmi is a treat to watch . Her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene . Indeed it wa surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because I expected it to be all the way Konkona Sen 's terrain . Shabana make you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life . She burden all her ambition and desire with ailing 18 year younger sister ( who is more like a daughter to her ) and an aging mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman . As for the leading actress from Guide ( that 's how I can recall her instantly ) there is hardly anything to say except few line and tear drop here and there . Ever dependable Rahul Bose play another pivotal role in the film , he show the emotion of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection . This man really amazes me with the variety of work he ha done . From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and so many others . He is one versatile I really wish if he had some more shot in the first part of the movie a well . The cameo in the movie is by Shefali Shah ( remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding ) . She look really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kid with real ease . She give you a glimpse of today 's Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it come to her husband 's prior relationship . The focus of camera ha been Meethi , portrayed by Konkona . She and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of 15 Park Avenue . She ha really worked hard for the character but there are time when she is not able to relate with the audience . The fateful accident of her life try to rope in sympathy and it ha been only partially successful . The movie try to address quite a few thing in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today 's modern India and also the twisted relationship in a tattered family . And I believe Aparna ha succeeded to certain extent . The helplessness of Meethi while she work a a journalist in a rural eastern state really give u all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of . Well after I finished 15 Park Avenue , there wa a sense of unquenched thirst within me . I wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally . It ha been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccup . Must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema , something with a strong purpose .",1
"I wa Stan in the movie `` Dreams Come True '' . Stan wa the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming ( where wa the ambulance ? ) The acting in this movie wa for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actor from the Fox Valley , Wisconsin . I saw the movie on the big screen . It played 2 night in 3 theater and wa something special to see yourself on the big screen . I may be bias , but overall , I enjoyed it . Also the soundtrack wa the band Spooner , who later became Garbage . My brother , Steve Charlton wa also in the movie . He played Swenson the man who come to the door on crutch to talk with the police .",0

Thats no reason to go nut and start writing stuff all over your body and on wall . The acting by whoever is playing his son is bad . From the get-go , a soon a he hears of his father obsession , he jump on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it . Totally unbelievable . I hope I never see this kid in another movie again . Its a waste of time watching this movie . Grab another . Boring piece of ... well . The number is killing him ? Give me a break . I wo n't spoil the ending for you , but let 's just say it is equally disappointing . 3 / 10 .",0
"Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel . Do n't expect the production value of a theatrical release , but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release . It is set up a Timon & Pumba begin watching the original Lion King in a darkened theater and abruptly switch track and begin narrating their own story . This is done with frequent comedic interruption . For example , during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pop on and a chagrined Pumba realizes he ha sat on the remote . These little moment pepper the movie , and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor . If you are particularly bothered by movie that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie , than this may not be your cup of tea . Animation is the best they 've invested in the Disney DTV line , and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material . The newer , independent material us a lot of the artistic style of the original . The voice talent are all well performed , though I could n't help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner . Many of the joke in the movie will be well recognized by viewer a recycled over the generation , but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirk of old friend than annoyingly repetitive . The music ha made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a Disney feature . The toe-tapping opening feature of 'Dig A Tunnel ' is well choreographed and hilarious . Timon and Pumba 's take on the Lion King 's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing . The only problem wa the reprise of the 'Dig A Tunnel ' at the end of the movie , switching it lyric and tune from defeatist to uplifting . Story line is pretty well done , and the integration of new plot element is done almost perfectly , though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little . The new story doe n't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moment to well , and doe better when it is resorting to full comedy . Overall , worth purchasing . If you like all the bonus feature that come with a typical 2-disc set , then go for it . For the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick , wait until it drop four or more dollar and go rent it right away . Damion Crowley .",1
"When this wa released , I thought this wa one of the most profane film ever made . However , thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmaker like him , there have been mainline film worse , language-wise , than this .... but this is a pretty brutal assault on one 's ear . Hey , I can take a lot of it , but this got ridiculous . In the first six minute alone , I heard a half-dozen usage 's of the Lord 's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words . I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 ? I could n't have been the only one . Not surprisingly , some of the feature actor included Jennifer Jason-Leigh , Burt Young , Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake . Since this film , Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image , at least playing the Godly `` Stonewall '' Jackson in `` Gods and Generals . '' Lang 's role here is just the opposite : perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who fall in love with a transvestite by the end of the film . Depressing , gloomy , semi-pornographic , repulsive : these are just a few of the adjective people used - even some Liberal critic - in describing this story , which is painted even worse in the novel . Of course , some of the better-known critic , all extreme Libs , praised the movie . However , they were the only one . Most critic were disgusted , a well almost all of the paying public . It 's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this . Trust me on this : there are no good , likable character in this entire movie . This is a mean , sick film : one of the worst of the `` modern era . '' That is , unless you enjoy seeing child abuse , drug abuse , teen prostitute , on and on - two straight hour of nothing but atrocity and just plain evil people . No thanks .",0
"I 'd give this film a 1/10 . This film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrate way too much upon the current `` skin trend '' in Bollywood movie . I 'd definitely not recommend teenager to watch this movie . What really make me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like Yash Chopra Films ever succumb to such an awful production ? They have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than `` adult '' audience too , which when exposed to these sort of gross movie , may wreck their growing mind set and succumb to thing devoid of sense and recognition . On the whole , film must not only be entertaining , but also must comprise of some sense a well . Certainly , this film is an immense disappointment to Yash Chopra fan , especially me myself . I am really disappointed over the plot , acting and everything else . Why ca n't people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the film , at least for once throughout the film ? The point is clear . I 'd like to put my opinion in short : `` Horrible - Disappointment - Lot of Adult Material - Lack of sensible `` substance '' - Lack of normal psyche - Worthless - Could grab a Cornetto or a Temptations chocolate instead ''",0
"I wa so surprised when I saw this film so much underrated ... I understand why some of you dislike this movie . Its pace is slow , a characteristic of Japanese film . Nevertheless , if you are absorbed in the film like me , you will find this not a problem at all . I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen . `` Shall We Dansu ? '' is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedy . It is very different from Hollywood one , e.g . Austin Powers or Scary Movies , in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minute . Rather , it is light-hearted , a movie that make you feel good . I love the movie because it make me feel `` real '' . The plot is straightforward yet pleasing . I wa so delighted seeing that Sugiyama ( the main role ) ha found the meaning of life in dancing . Before I watched the film I wa slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork . I felt lost . However , this film made me think of the bright side of life . I believed I wa in the same boat of Sugiyama ; if he could find himself in his hobby , why could n't I ? It reminded me of `` exploring my own future '' and discovering the happiness in my daily life . It is important to note that the actor are not professional dancer . While some of you may find the dancing scene not a perfect a you expect , I kinda like it a it make me feel that the character are really `` alive '' , learning to dance a the film go on . Over all , this film is encouraging and heart-warming . As a comedy , it doe it job perfectly . It definitely deserves 10 star . And yes Aoki is funny : -D",1
"I wa greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary . The content is poorly produced , very poor quality video and , especially awful audio . There 's extremely little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no example of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music . The interview of people who knew Bruce Haack are ad-hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo . Too much yak and not enough Haack . Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span , even for slow and/or difficult subject matter , I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the part I slept through . If you watch this , make sure that you are set up , before viewing , like Alex in A Clockwork Orange . Bruce Haack deserves much better than this . Shame on the producer and director .",0
"I 've tried to reconcile why so many bad review of this film , while the vast majority of review are given a rating of between 7 and 10 . The reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review , although a few have done that quite nicely already . This film is confusing , depressing , and doe n't have a happy ending . I still gave Pola X a rating of 10 , because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film . That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking . I 've only seen two of Carax 's film : this one and Mauvis Sang . As with this film , I 'm being somewhat pretentious when I call this one of Carax 's best films- but I am . Carax ha a minimalist style . If that type of film doe not appeal to you and is boring , then it would be best not to watch this . But Pola X wa le minimalist than Mauvis Sang , so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller- at least for my taste . I found it quite interesting and absorbing . The two lead role did an excellent job acting . ( I mean the lead and the young woman he thought wa his half sister . ) Catherine D. is always great , but her role wa not very large or significant in the story . But everyone did a fine job . I thought the cult stuff wa great . It may have not been very believable , but that is due to it being rather abstract . There is a lot going on between the line in this film . This is a very Freudian psycho-thriller .",1
"WARNING : SPOILER , SPOILER , SPOILER ! ! ! ! This is written for filmgoers who may have walked away from `` Mood for Love '' perplexed and confused about path the main character choose in life . From reading other comment and review it seems that many viewer and critic missed some very important detail which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful tease of a movie . We are so use to seeing blatant SEX in narration that we forget that there wa a time when filmakers would suggest the `` dirty deed '' by simply showing the slack-mouthed couple ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip ... '' Meet your child '' . The director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of Mr Chow and Mrs Chan . Last warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Mr Chow fool Mrs Chan into showing her real emotion when they rehearse his departure forever . Next scene : Mrs Chan lean her head on Mr Chow in the taxi and say `` I do not want to go home tonight '' . Translation : `` Let 's Do It '' Why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouse , get a divorce , raise their love child and live happily ever after ? The answer is that this whole story take place in Hong Kong during the Sixties . A bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an adulteress ; whereas , a `` legitimate '' child could live a tragic but noble/honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating `` father '' -the invisible Mr Chan . In short , Mr Chow and Mrs Chan sacrifice their relationship for the future of their child . That is why Mr Chow , upon learning that Mrs Chan life alone with a little boy give a knowing smile and end his dream of making Mrs Chan his Mrs Chow . He then , also realizes why Mrs Chan went to all the way to Singapore to be with him , only to reconsiders at the last momment and leave .. , choosing to never see him again . ( But not before taking some unnamed keepsake ) Mr Chow life with this wonderful secret with no one to tell . No one , except for a crumbling temple wall and of course we the viewer , ... but only if we listen carefuly .",1

There are only length and no climaxes.The only climax is Shahrukh Khan . But although I am a huge fan of his , I could n't stand this movie . Even he ca n't make this movie exiting . The movie is not a bad a `` King Uncle '' and if you 're an Art-house fan or like it slow , you might maybe like it . It 's not funny , it 's not interesting , it 's not catching .

"This is a bad movie . Not one of the funny bad one either . This is a lousy bad one . It wa actually painful to watch .

The script wa terrible and the acting wa like fingernail across a chalkboard . If you have n't seen it , do n't .

This is an excellent movie and I wish that they would put it out on DVD for people to purchase . It is difficult to try to catch it on TV all the time . As you do not know when one of the station will decide to air it . Can someone tell me what file company make it so I can write to them and see if they will release it to the public ? I only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and I only got to see it once last year . My sister and I are all looking for it in every store that sell any video . John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great . They put out some much older movie and I think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and I think if we could contact the producer and voice our request we might get some of them put out on DVD .,1
"This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent . Full of clichés and a plot that make absolutely no sense ! I cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10 .

The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it . Whats sad is that I never had great expectation from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed . Take my word , do n't waste your $ 8 on this piece of trash . The only entertainment I got out of the movie wa making fun of the director name . In all , highly NOT RECOMMENDED !",0
"putting aside the `` i 'm so sure '' s and `` totally gnarly '' s this is one of the sweetest and lifelike romance portrayed on film . deborah foreman ( where is she now ? ) a julie and nicolas cage a randy are a classic a romeo and juliet , tony and maria , jake and samantha ... you ca n't help but fall in love with them . plus the soundtrack - the plimsouls , spark , the fur , the flirt , and of course , modern english - is also outstanding . for fan of film about young love , i 'd equally recommend the recent film all the real girl by david gordon green .",1

"A film that is so much a 30 's Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output , unlike today where simply getting audience is the object . Curitz wa one of the quintessential Warners house director working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality , working method that were very much the requirement of a director at Warners , a studio that wa one of the `` big five '' major in this era producing quality film for their large chain of theatre . Even though we have a setting of the upper class on Long Island there is the generic Warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been `` torn from the headline '' . Another example is the when the photographer comment on the girl leg early in the film and she comment that `` They 're not the trophy '' give the film a more working man , down to earth feel , for these were the audience that Warners were targeting in the great depression . ( ironically Columbia and Universal were the two minor under these five major until the 50 's when their involvement in television changed their fortune - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent ) Curtiz ha created from an excellent script a film that move along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angle and swift editing . Thank heaven there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along .",1
"I got this DVD well over 2 year ago and only decided to watch it yesterday . I do n't know why it took me so long a I do like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis . While it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie , there are some old thing missing that bog this Gadget right down the toilet . First of all the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent . The composer try to compromise by doing a score that sound similar but it 's still just no good enough . The Gadget-mobile is now a talking car , not a car that can turn into a van . Plus it look a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool . Penny no longer ha her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all . The plot is non-existent . There 's something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using for some never revealed evil but that 's all I got . What the deal wa with the short/giant Italian guy I will never know . It had nothing to do with anything . And if the title is anything to go by , his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever . And he stay on the force so why it 's called 'last case ' is a mystery also . I wa n't impressed at all . This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD , but do n't let that prompt you into buying whatever Inspector Gadget DVDs you can . I sold this mere second after finally watching it . No kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it .",0
"This episode of Buffy wa one of my personal favorite . Also number three of Joss ' personal favorite a well . The episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folk at the Emmy 's decided it merited a nomination . Unfortunately it did n't win . When Hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewer , which wa the highest rated episode of season four . That should tell you something . Even though there wa very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in . Those gentleman character ( who were played my mime ) were some of the scariest creature the show ha produced ( or any network TV show I 've seen ) . Nothing is creepier then a bunch of silver teethed men coming at you with a scalpel while smiling away . I think that despite the lack of dialogue the actor did a fantastic job on the episode .",1
"Bulletproof is quite clearly a disposable film . The kind where bullet riddled good guy and bad guy are splatted everywhere , so much so that you really are n't supposed to see them a human . The yawn between the line from Wayans and Sandler are extensive indeed . They try hard but , ala and alack , persona itself doe not a good film make . Jimmy Caan play a nifty villain but he 's always had that redneck edge at the ready . My favorite 's scene is the repeated clip of a TV ad in which Caan reveals the virtue of America can be shown to the world by having 2 car in every garage . Aside from that it 's a buddy movie with gun for brain . Pass on this one .",0
"I think this movie wa made a good a it could have been . With only 4 month and a 52000 $ budget - I 'm surprised this wa n't worse . If you are not to care about the CG or special effect , this movie is great . Okay , the movie is not that well made ( I 'm sure it could have been but , you try to do better in only 4 month ) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting . DO n't trust me when I say that this movie is good , cause I also find the 1933 King Kong to be good . I must confess that I did n't watch the complete movie either ... I might have fast forwarded some minute here and there ...",1
"I gave this 4 star because it ha a lot of interesting theme many here have already mentioned . From the domestic violence , to sexuality and many of the taboo therein . Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much a I would science fiction . It 's bleak , depressing and hopeless . While I do n't mind a le than cheery ending , I 'm really very tired of the `` human suck '' cliché that 's central to every movie . I know you ca n't get a liberal art degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred a a member of the human race , but how 's 'bout a a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil ! Right now , if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die , just go out , find a lake and swim 'til your arm are tired . This way you wo n't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive . It 's silly , not thoughtful , and boring .",0
"One of my all time favourite film , ever . Just beautiful , full of human emotion , wit , humour , intelligence . The story grows , a doe the lesson of life , just a wonderful film in so many way . The cast are also fantasic ..... a great selection of the finest British talent around . I loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film . Italy ha to be one of the most romantic place to form a story such a this , - everything about this film work . I love it : )",1
"This is a really mediocre film in the vein of `` Buckaroo Banzai . '' The cast run around like `` Mad Max '' wannabe , and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience . Wheeler-Nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actress you are delighted to stumble across in film , but she is n't worth the price of rental . Space Maggot start an electrical fire , and burn a vote of 4 .",0
"being a high school student , i have to take a health class . this year , the topic is drug . we learn about the harm they can cause a person . from what we talk about , i still believe and know that drug can really mess a person up . anyway , my teacher wanted u to watch this . naturally , we groan and start to sleep , but like the rest of my class , i actually did enjoy this movie . it wa totally real , and not sugar coated at all . the character were amazing and believable . even the plot wa outstandingly realistic and believable . what i liked about this movie mainly wa how it got the point of the effect 's drug can take on an abuser , and the consequence the person ha to deal with . everyone reassures themselves that nothing bad will happen to them . well let get serious . anything can happen in a small town , even to your best friend , like Sam and Chris . this movie show it . a person can really learn a lot from watching this . it wa pretty effective .",1
"This movie is good for entertainment purpose , but it is not historically reliable . If you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself ` Oh I want to learn more about Custer 's life and his last stand ' , do not rent ` They Died with Their Boots On ' . But , if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film , with a little bit of romance and just for a good story , this is a fun movie to watch . The story start out with Custer 's ( Errol Flynn ) first day at West Point . Everyone love his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything . The movie follows his career from West Point and his many battle , including his battle in the Civil War . The movie end with his last stand at Little Big Horn . In between the battle scene , he find love and marriage with Libby ( Olivia De Havilland ) . Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant , but suave George Armstrong Custer well . Olivia De Havilland play the cute , sweet Libby very well , especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet . Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance . The acting in general wa impressive , especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical ) of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel . Her character will definitely make you laugh . The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scene . The beautiful costume set the tone of the era . The script , at time , wa corny , although the movie wa still enjoyable to watch . The director 's portrayal of Custer wa a a hero and history show this is debatable . Some will watch this movie and see Custer a a hero . Others will watch this movie and learn hate him . I give it a thumb up for this 1942 western film .",1
"This movie ha made me upset ! When I think of Cat in the hat . Im thinking of cat in the hat book . You know , the one from a few year back that parent read to thier child . Well , I though that this movie would be a lot like that ! But much to my suprise wa nothing like the book ! Insted it is more like young adult humor movie . In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool ( hoe ) cat talk to it like it is his hoe ( agin adult humor ) . the naming of his car I all so though wa a little untastful for a kid movie . under the rating you 'll find : mild cude humor and some double-entendres . I think in short this mean adult humor . I wish I could return this movie ! wal-mart said they would n't because the movie ha been opened . If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy .",0
"Mickey Rourke hunt Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard 's Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared . He ha had a steady string of appearance before he burst back on the scene . He wa memorable in : Domino , Sin City , Man on Fire , Once Upon a Time in Mexico , and Get Carter . But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler ( 2008 ) , we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter . Whenever we get to know him , Rourke remains a cool , but sleazy , muscle bound slim ball . This is an Elmore Leonard story , and production . Leonard wrote such notable movie a taunt western thriller 3:10 to Yuma , Be Cool , Jackie Brown , Get Shorty , 52 Pick-Up , and Joe Kidd . This mean that we get tough guy , some good , some not so good . It also mean we get tight , realistic plot with character doing what is best for them in each situation , weaving complication into violent conclusion . Killshot is no different . Tough , slim ball killer Rourke stalk unhappily married witness Lane . Think History of Violence meet No Country for Old Men . It is not a intense , bloody or gory a those two , but it is almost a good . If you like those two , including David Croneberg 's equally wonderful Eastern Promises , you will like Killshot also . Director John Madden ha not done a lot of movie . His last few were enjoyable , if not successful : Proof , Captain Corelli 's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love . Diana Lane ha n't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performance in Unfaithful . Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic story such a Nights in Rodanthe , Must Love Dogs , and Under the Tuscan Sun . Here she is right on mark , balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension . This is a small part for Rosario Dawson . Yet Dawson doe a good job with it . You see a lot more of Lane , including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut . While you are in the crime drama section , also pick up Kiss , Kiss , Bang , Bang , and Gone Baby Gone , and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead . The last ha wonderful performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman , Ethan Hawke , Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney . Killshot flopped at the box office . More is our luck . It is certainly worth a 3-4 dollar rental , if you like this genre . 6/20/2009",0
"`` Müllers Büro '' is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the end , while others will stop watching it within five minute . It is a parody of detective movie with all the twist and turn ; the action take place only at night in the dark corner of a city which resembles Batman 's Gotham City ( look carefully at the street , building , the police car chasing the criminal , etc. ) . It is also a parody of musical with it really funny character such a Müller 's secretary and Vitasek 's ( the actor playing Müller 's assistant ) lover who do their best to sing , albeit not very successfully . The space occupied by the character have their own presence in the film such a the decadent Blue Box ( there is a real club with this name in Vienna ) where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background , Müller 's apartment with the black paint smeared on the wall and the dirty kitchen , Müller 's bureau with the sweet picture of his assistant , etc . The humorous moment in the movie are many and include `` flat in the face '' type of humor such a Müller farting in his assistant 's face , the prostitute charging Müller extra for orgasm , the ridiculous outfit of the female thug of Montana , etc . A legendary film from the 80 's especially for those interested in Austrian or German-speaking cinema .",1
"Peter Sollett ha created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York , or Loisaida , a it 's known by the local . Mr. Sollett 's heart is in the right place a he examines this dysfunctional family , that is typical of the different 'inner city ' of the country . Mr. Sollett accentuates the positive in the story he present . These are basically good kid , the child of parent that have left them and whose grandmother ha taken under her wing . Instead of presenting his character a loser , Mr. Sollett show a positive side they all have . These kid are not into drug , or are stealing because they are poor . Had this story been done by Hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotype , instead of child that are struggling , but deep down inside , they are not defeated . Victor Rasuk , a Victor Vargas , wa a revelation . He is a natural . So is July Marte . Her character show u a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doe n't want to do . Altagracia Guzman , a the grandmother is excellent . She conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchild into the thing she belief in and that are so important to her . All in all , this wa an excellent picture thanks to Peter Sollett .",1
"The long list of `` big '' name in this flick ( including the ubiquitous John Mills ) did n't bowl me over to the extent that I could n't judge the film on it actual merit . It is FULL of stereotype , caricature , and standard , set scene , from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer . The music track wa such that at one point , about an hour before the end , I thought the film wa over : loud , rising crescendo , grand flourish and finish then silence , but then the movie continued ! I found no real storyline , haphazard writing , but smartly-pressed uniform and the pretty Jean Simmons ( pre-nose job ) with a rousing little ditty . I can not say that this picture ha any of the ingredient which make a film great . I found it maudlin , mawkish and minor .",0
"I love the Jurassic Park movie , they are three of my all time favorite movie . And I hate this game , if there wa one game I wish I never own for the Super Nintendo wa this one . How can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful ? And to make it worst , I wa scare of this game when I wa a kid . How dumb wa that but then again I wa a kid when this game wa first out . The game play in this game is just odd . One minute it 's a action game and then it 's a shooter . What in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game . The Sound in the game is just terrible to listen . The music is just too sick to listen to . The Controllers in the game do n't work most of the time . Jurassic Park the game is just a waste of time and money and wo n't be a classic . Avoid at all cost",0
"utterly useless ... having been there , done that with the subject matter i have to say this capture the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect . It may have done so had the character not just been mouthpiece for incredibly dire , unrealistic drivel . So many cringe-worthy scene that would put The Office to shame ( not a compliment to this film ) . It also may have helped to have some semblance of a story , a point , a message , a commentary , anything . Seriously , Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say on the subject than this film ( term used very loosely in this case ) . There should be minus number reserved for film like this . -10 ( extra turd )",0
"Wild Rebels is fun in a bad way , but also frustrating due to the actual good , or at least workable , element in the story . It deal with a race car driver ( Steve Alaimo ) who get mixed up in a group of bikers called Satan 's Angels , who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank . Meanwhile Alaimo also get recruited by the cop to report back to them what the Angels are up to and where they 'll rob next . It 's not even that the film is really too 'dated ' , though it doe of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film ( from the band on stage in one scene , to Alaimo `` performing '' if you could call that drek that , to the regular generic score ) . It 's just that there 's not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic , direction , and better actor for the part . As it is I did n't have a major disliking towards the film , a I did with the Hellcats , but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all , too . What could come through a being unpredictable only come through with stupid thing like the name of the Florida town ( 'Citrusville ' ho-ho ) . So it 's not completely un-worthy then of it Mystery Science Theater 3000 status a of late . The commentary is good on the movie , even if once or twice I almost wanted to hear what the character on screen were saying in case it might have some worth . Wild Rebels might be more of a good time if you 've got a six-pack and low expectation , but a it is I would n't watch it again .",0
"I ` ve seen this movie twice , both time on Cinemax . The first time in it ` s unrated version which is soft-core porn at it ` s best and the second time in a trimmed down ( cut all the sex and most of the nudity out ) version which wa entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way . The unrated version ha a tremendous sex scene with Nikki Fritz , a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world ( no pun intended ) . Unfortunately , in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out , a are all the other sex scene . Rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the sibling of bigger star ( Stallone , Sheen , Travolta , etc ; ) trying to act . We also get appearance by B-queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward ( Robin from the old Batman series ) .",1
"If this is someone 's `` favorite '' movie , they need some serious help . There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest . I have n't seen the original movie this is the remake of ( some 1950s film ) , but it simply ha to be better than this newer bastardization . A major get kicked out of the military for being a fringe element , and wind up teaching child at an ROTC school . Unfortunately , the major is Daman Wayans ... so the child are in for a world of annoying , humorless asininity . Can Wayans whip these loser into shape ? Can they get him to become a little more human ? The film bomb a most Wayans film do , with only a few sparkling moment . William Hickey get about one minute of screen time , fair too little . This charming old man ( known best to me a a `` Tales from the Crypt '' actor , known best to you a Uncle Louis from `` Christmas Vacation '' ) shine every moment he 's on screen , which is n't much here . Bam Bam Bigelow also make an appearance a a biker , which fit him perfectly . I would n't mind slightly more Bam Bam , but I think he carried the role of `` biker '' about a far a it could be carried for a military film . And then there 's the attractive teacher , who someone fall for Major Payne even though he treat the kid poorly , ha no social skill and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with . She must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate . I 'm not sure which ( though it would seem `` stupid '' since the movie make it clear she get out of the house often enough ) . Wayans had one shining moment : a dance sequence where he performs a series of move ( including a very nice `` robot '' ) , and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew . This scene wa enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle . Seriously , avoid this film . If you want to see a film a bout a loser who help loser kid become hero , rent or buy `` Ernest Goes to Camp '' . At least he 's a lovable loser , and actually funny . Maybe if Major Payne had fought a badger I 'd feel better , but he did n't . Forget Payne , forget Wayans ... you can do so much better .",0
"I concur with the other user comment . Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it scream mid 80 's . I think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture do n't always match up . If anyone can truly say this is a good movie , they need to be locked up . It is so sad how money ha so much power over people that they will do anything to get it . I feel I lost intelligence from watching this . I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watched this but now I just feel bad . I bought this a part of a 3 movie pack for $ 9.99 and I can honestly say I would have been better off literally throwing the money away . Forgive me Jesus .",0
"I have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episode , I still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow , yet thoughtful action of the story-telling . I am still a fan ..... with some minor pain . Though this installment into the Gundam saga is very cool and ha what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrong of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything ( sound familiar ? ) , I have to say that this one get a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the life of the main character and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plan ( especially the character called Wufei ... I mean he whine more than an American character on a soap opera . Get a counselor , will ya ? ) Besides for the over-exaggerated drama ( I think that mostly come from the dubbing of the English voice actor ) , this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again . I mean it can always be worse . It could be like the recent installment , SEED ...... eeeewwww , talk about mellow-dramatic .... I 'll chat about that one later .",1
"I 've seen my share of Woody Allen 's movie , and while they 're not always great , you can usually be sure you 're going to be entertained . Probably the last really good one were Bullets Over Broadway ( '94 ) and Mighty Aphrodite ( '95 ) - since then the one I 've seen have been patchy but watchable . And so when I wa invited to see the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda , which I wa n't even aware had been released yet , I went along happily . I had n't really heard much about it so I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised . What I got wa definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I 've seen . The premise is over-explained , the cast is terrible , the script is slow and lifeless . Too many scene said nothing and yet were stretched out , I assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film . I do n't mind the concept behind this film - two director discus how a simple situation could be interpreted a a comedy or a tragedy , and obviously the film proceeds to show u that , by playing out both scenario . The problem is neither of these 'two film ' are any good at all . The comedy is n't funny and the tragedy is n't very tragic . It seems like Allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam , or time , to actually complete the film . The general level of acting is notably bad also - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table , and it 's basically a Woody Allen impression . Previously good actor like Chloe Sevigny just come off a annoying , and the worst of the bunch is Radha Mitchell a Melinda ( which is a shame , because her character is in nearly every scene ! ) . To be fair to the actor , the script they are working with is lacking if not non-existent . Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classic like Manhattan or Annie Hall .",0
"Although the premise of the movie involves a major `` coincidence , '' the actor all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life . I found myself rooting for the character played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti , empathizing with both , and wanting them to reconcile . Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are fine in their role a well , doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship . While the story tends to leap through time , occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail , it still flow and avoids any real confusion . This interesting storyline ha all the element for a good `` chick flick . ''",1
"I saw this movie , and the play , and I have to add that this wa the most touching story that I had ever seen . Until I saw this movie I wa unaware of how awful life wa and probably still is for the South African child and adult that were and are living in that era . It brought tear to my eye and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive , And to bring the child right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing . This simply surpass a five star , I rate it a ten . Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story . Although it ha been 12 year since this story ha been told , it is still one that lay heavy in my heart.If there is a VHS , or DVD out there on the play , Please notify me ASAP.Thank You . PS There wa nothing wrong with the kid wanting to bring awareness of their problem and condition to the attention of other country in hope that some one would have a heart and offer assistance .",1
"And nothing wrong in that ! Heartily endorse the comment of boblipton and Snow Leopard . I 'm thrilled to find this movie is available on US DVD - I 've only ever seen it through once - I persuaded the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their Conrad Veidt season some year ago - and long to see it again . Barrymore is resplendent when engaged , a in this movie , possibly because of the prick of having a renowned German actor a a foil . And Veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer ( doe n't he pick his nose at one point ? ) This is one of the seminal film to connect 'Dr Jekyll ' with '20th Century ' , 'Grand Hotel ' or 'Midnight ' ; and 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari ' or 'The Student of Prague ' with 'The Spy in Bladk ' , 'Contraband ' and 'Casablanca ' . See it !",1
"I 've seen this amusing little 'brit flick'many time . The only problem is Its currently unavailable on video or DVD . I'ts certainly a contender for a DVD release .

"I 'm not sure this film could ever match the first one , even if it starred the original seven ( notwithstanding the fact that four were killed ) . It just doe n't have the spark and chemistry . All the actor seem tired and look a if they are just going through the motion to get their paycheck . It 's interesting how Yul Brynner is `` magnificent '' in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel . Yet when he star in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s his character ( in the same matching black pant , shirt and hat ) evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 film 's Chris Adams . There 's nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching , even on cable .",0
"Beautiful film , pure Cassavetes style . Gena Rowland give a stunning performance of a declining actress , dealing with success , aging , loneliness ... and alcoholism . She try to escape her own subconscious ghost , embodied by the death spectre of a young girl . Acceptance of oneself , of human condition , though it overall difficulty , is the real purpose of the film . The parallel between the theatrical sequence and the film itself are puzzling : it 's like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin . If all american movie could only be that top-quality , dealing with human relation on an adult level , not trying to infantilize and standardize feeling ... One of the best drama ever . 10/10 .",1
"The 20th animated Disney classic is often criticized by many people a `` mediocre '' or poor in quality , but it is a great movie . Too bad that `` The Aristocats '' doe n't get the deserved credit . I personally see it a one of my favorite Disney classic . Despite being extremely underrated , it is one of the funniest Disney classic . It is full of hilarious ( some of them , hysterical ) moment . Edgar , the greedy butler , is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief . He 's one of my favorite Disney villain because he is so funny . Every scene with Edgar and the hound dog Napoleon and Lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you 'll ever see , especially the one when Edgar drive his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge , with the dog chasing him . That is hysterical ! But the classic humor doe n't just come from Edgar or the hound dog . Other character have their moment a well . About the quality subject , it is n't perfect , but remains on a high level . Even after Walt Disney 's death those artist knew how to keep faithful to Walt 's spirit and `` The Aristocats '' is one of those example . They do n't make them like this nowadays ! As usual , legendary Disney actor voice the character . In this case , we have Phil Harris , Sterling Holloway , Paul Winchell , Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram . The character are cool in general : Thomas O'Malley , Duchess and her 3 kitten , the mouse Roquefort , the alley cat , the English goose , the hound dog and the horse . The human character are included a well : the eccentric and kind retired Opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille , the comic Madame 's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself ! About the soundtrack , it ha some nice and catchy song such a Thomas O'Malley 's theme ( but I ca n't remember it name ) , `` Everybody Wants to be a Cat '' and `` The Aristocats '' ( sung by Maurice Chevalier ) , for example . This movie take place in Paris ( France ) , in the year of 1910 . Above all , this is a joyful , nice and very pleasant movie . A timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten , but very worthy . This should definitely be on Top 250 .",1
"I 'm not going to say that this movie is horrible , because I have seen worse , but it 's not even halfway decent . The plot is very confusing . I could n't really figure out what wa happening and where thing were going . When the movie wa over , I wa left scratching my head . I watched through to the end of the credit to see if they had something after them that may clear thing up , but once the credit were over , that wa it . I felt like I wa jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie , with little or no transition between the two . Character development is very shallow . I could n't figure out when somebody wa angry or had a grudge against someone . I could n't tell if half of the character were just supposed to be drunk , stoned , mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them . This film seems to be based around stereotype ( to it 's credit , they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band ) , which SHOULD make character development easier , since so many other film have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child , or the trial of a heroin addict trying to come clean . Stereotypes are easy to depict , which would explain why so many bad film tend to overuse stereotypical character . This film , on the other hand , us stereotypical character left and right , but then try to keep them a incomprehensible a possible . Another problem with the character is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation . I guess that 's OK because so little time wa spent developing the character that I really did n't get a chance to know any of them , so I never really missed any of them . And last but not least wa Sadie 's singing . It 's awful . The music backing her up is not prize winner , but it is usually drowned out by the screech that are released from Sadie 's vocal cord . I swear that there 's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minute . I seriously thought I wa going to have to turn it off during this howl-a-thon . As a whole , this movie is confusing . Characters are ill-developed , Georgia 's acting is wooden and stiff , Sadie 's character is yanked from one bad situation to another , with no back story or explanation . The music wa unbearable , and I can think of no good reason to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain .",0
"Appalling , shallow , materialistic nonsense . How woman ( and gay men ? ) can enjoy this rubbish is beyond me . No self-respecting man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold digger . What is even more concerning is that so many reviewer say they relate to the woman on the show . If that is the future of woman , Lord help u all . Showing your independence and being respected a equal with men should not be about spreading your leg every three second with a different man . I think this demeans woman and doe not do them justice . But this review is no rant against woman . Fans of this show say it is `` hilarious '' and `` rivoting '' but every time I have watched this show I have just struggled to stay awake . Despite the narrative of the reporter woman , at no point in this show is there even anything close to something that could be considered a rational thought . So , it 's not entertaining , and it 's not informative , so why would you bother watching it ? One out of ten star .",0
"A throwback to the `` old fashioned '' Westerns of the 30 and 40 ( such a DODGE CITY ) , DALLAS ha a number of thing going for it : Gary Cooper at his coolest , blazing Technicolor photography by Ernest Haller ( GONE WITH THE WIND ) and a pulse-pounding Max Steiner ( KING KONG , GWTW , DODGE CITY et al . ) score . In addition , there is a masquerade , mistaken identity , a faked death and more hair-breath escape than a Republic serial . As always , Cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure . Forget the 50 angst Western ... this is pure entertainment !",1
"We sat through this movie thinking why is this or that scene in the movie , what doe this have to do with the plot ? We hoped that by the end everything would be slightly more clear . It wa not to be . I think the director in a fit of pique threw the script up in the air and then some minor ( and vengeful ) underling reassembled it randomly with no regard to the scene being filmed ( possibly with scissors and glue-stick ) . The film 's motif include : Communism bad ? Nihilism bad ? Poor parenting bad ? Threesomes bad ? TV bad ? Coherent scripting bad ? Deconstructionism good ? It 's really not clear . Finally , no German water taxi would EVER have an unchained staircase that would let passenger fall in to the water .

"On the back burner for year ( so it wa reported ) this television reunion of two of the most beloved character in sitcom history started off badly - and went straight downhill from there . Mary Richards ( Mary Tyler Moore ) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern ( Valerie Harper ) meet in New York after a long estrangement and catch up on each other 's life . What a novel concept ! But , sad to relate , nothing worth talking about ( let alone making a movie about ) ha happened to either of them in the intervening year . So , instead , the script content itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another ( most having to do with older woman in the workplace ) , while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner . The supporting cast is instantly forgettable , the humor is nonexistent , and the chemistry which Moore and Harper once had together is gone . Moore allegedly stalled this project for year , waiting for `` just the right script '' before committing herself . If this wa the one she considered `` right '' , what on earth were the one she turned down like ? It 's not the age of the character that doe this in ( for time inevitably march on ) , but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the element that made the series work . At one time this wa intended a a pilot but , all to obviously , it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsor . Or for that matter , among potential audience . Quickly and mercifully forgotten , the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic .",0
"* * Could be considered some mild spoiler , but no more than in anyone else 's review of this film . * * I knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original `` Carrie , '' which wa more of a film about social criticism than it wa about setting the gym on fire . Carrie White wa `` victim '' epitomized , and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel . Whoever conceived the `` Rachel '' character for `` The Rage '' must have completely missed the subtlety of `` Carrie . '' For the audience to genuinely share the victim 's rage , s/he must be a sympathetic character -- a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of his/her own vice . Rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spacek 's `` Carrie . '' And she look and act like she should be right along-side the 'attractive and popular brigade ' that she end up torching . She , like the rest of them , ha a soul that is every bit a corrupt , whereas Carrie wa a complete innocent . It just doe n't work . There 's no satisfaction in seeing the pretty child -- not even the `` Home Improvement '' boy -- getting offed in this movie 's climactic scene . And it 's so unnecessarily gory ! There wa no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym ! And there is one person in particular that this movie should NOT have had the audacity to kill off ... but I wo n't say who it is . If you 've seen the original `` Carrie , '' it 's the sort of character who dy unjustly . At least they DID create the connection to Carrie appropriately ; it 's explained a it should have been . But that , and the arm tattoo , which wa done rather nicely , is just about the only thing this movie ha going for it . Yet another hideous `` Scream '' knock-off , and it taint the reputation of one of the most compelling film ever made . Rating : 1 out of 10 . I wa n't expecting much , but I wa still horribly disappointed . An unsympathetic character , a series of irritating pop-culture reference thrown in for no good reason , and an ending scene that pale in comparison to `` Carrie '' 's gravestone shocker .",0
"Better than average World War II-era `` who-dun-it '' featuring Warner Baxter a a former gangster who suffered amnesia and ha been reborn a a psychiatrist now known a Robert Ordway who help both the police and criminal who want to go straight . Crime Doctor 's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problem . The link to `` courage '' is not particularly clear . This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wife have under mysterious circumstance and who in turn dy in a locked room under condition that resemble suicide but Dr. Ordway label murder . Hillary Brooke play the part of widow Kathleen Carson who is involved with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage . As a mystery novelist , Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor a is Lloyd Corrigan a an aficionado in crime . Spooky house with creaking door , casket in the cellar , and suspect that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense . The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good . Direction , production design , and photography stand out . The exterior shot and costume suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average `` B '' detective thriller . Strongly recommended .",1
"I had high hope for this movie . The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man , with a lot of experience and knowledge when it come to movie . I am a fan of a lot of Belgian movie , but this movie is bad . It 's completely unbelievable that actor who are 34 are suddenly playing the role of teenager . The `` linguistic game '' were hideous and over the top . Nothing about the film seemed real to me . The ending wa way too deus ex machina for me . I am very disappointed and think I wasted an hour and a half of my life .",0
"I am not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place , but Baba wa a huge disappointment . In between an awful storyline , the action and song were only mediocre . The storyline becomes very preachy . Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR , Rajni almost appeared to be running a Tamil Nadu 's next big guru . My wife tell me that since this film came out , Rajni swore off doing any more movie ! We were lucky initially to have bought Babu ( an oldie by Sivajiganeshan ) online by accident when trying to buy this one .... that wa a great film , which made up for having bought this dud ... except it make Baba look even worse by comparison ! Bryan",0
"Truly a disgusting , vile film , with only a small amount of real humour . The character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme ( intentionally so , obviously ) , and portrayed in the most pathetic , seedy manner . My wife and I found this film horribly upsetting , with absolutely no redeeming feature at all . Frankly , I wish I had never seen it . I consider this British effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment . Those who enjoyed this film have an ability I totally lack : that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalor . The producer should be ashamed of themselves .",0
"Obabakoak is a bunch of short story with an only common point : the little Vasque town of Obaba . In this film , the director try to explain some of these story by using a young reporter a a continuum . The result is a strange film , a it ha any main character ( the movie spends about 20 min . to each tale ) other than the town of Obaba . Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring . It wa by far the best film of the year in Spain , but , well , that 's not saying too much . The only good thing of the film is the precious scenario . It is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story .",0
"The entire civilized world by now know that this is where Emil Sitka say his immortal `` Hold hand , you lovebird . '' But Shemp Howard , Professor of Music , steal the show . Watch him tutoring Dee Green a she fracture the `` Voices of Spring . '' Watch Shemp a he shave by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string . Watch him a he get walloped by Christine McIntyre . Watch him , and you will laugh and learn . Moe is no slouch either . Watch him a he attempt to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap . Larry , a usual , is the Zen master of reaction . All in all , one of the very best Stooge short . You wo n't find one weak moment .",1
"I 'm a huge fan of war movie , and , a a Vietnam combat vet , have some experience with the technical detail . I worked with the bomb guy more than once and have nothing but respect for them . Other vet , and Iraq vet in particular , have summarized the inaccuracy in this movie very well . Poetic license is one thing , but this movie is a complete fantasy , and fails badly because of it . No bomb disposal unit , or any unit , would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minute . Military unit prize conformity and discipline for a reason ; it save life . The opening scene particularly annoyed me . The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately . Yelling , `` Stop dialing '' is not an effective deterrent . It got worse from there . The scene with the sniper were particularly egregious . As others have noted , your average EOD guy doe n't know jack about being a sniper , and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretch the imagination . Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just would n't happen . Somebody might shoot him , but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movie . I could go on , but , a I said , others have pointed these thing out in detail . This is not a good movie , and if it win any award at all , it 's a further reflection of why `` La La land '' is so named .",0
"All right , here 's the deal : if you 're easily offended then you might want to stay far , far away from this one . There are some painfully funny moment in the movie , but I probably blushed about a much a I laughed . Actually , I probably blushed MORE than I laughed . And if I wa n't literally blushing on the outside , then I wa blushing on the inside . If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame . Whether that 's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose . I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit , but this is a movie that I simply can not give a blanket recommendation due to it subject matter . If I were to say , `` This movie is hilarious , go check it out ! '' and some sweet , little old church-going lady head to the theater and ha a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situation , well , that 's just something I do n't need on my conscience . So how raunchy is it ? Hmm , try about 100 time worse than The Wedding Crashers . Honestly . My mom would 've walked out during the first scene . I feel it 's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect . There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here , but that 's what I come to expect from the man ( Judd Apatow ) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared . I 'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald ; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money . Paul Rudd proclaiming , `` If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I 'll Ya Mo burn this place down , '' is hilarious , but it 's one of those thing that the majority of the audience wo n't appreciate . And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo 's Word Up , I laughed for a good two minute after the joke wa over , whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it . Strangely enough , despite the raunch , there 's an admirable moral to the story . The movie doe n't portray Carrell a some freaky loser just because he 's a virgin . He 's really portrayed a a likable , admirable character . Sure , he 's a little weird . After all , he ha a framed Asia poster , `` more videogames than an Asian kid , '' and a toy collection that feature the Million Dollar Man 's BOSS , but we 're never led to believe that there 's actually anything wrong with the fact that he 's a virgin . As odd a it may seem , there 's a bit of an `` it 's OK to wait '' message . But man , oh man , please be warned that this push it R rating about a far a it can go . That wa certainly Apatow 's intention . According to him , he just let some of the guy ( particularly Rogen and Malco ) improv and talk the way they normally talk , all in an effort to find lot of new way to be dirty . If you can handle that or talk that way yourself , then you 'll love the movie . I 'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex joke . I find that subtle , clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 us of the f-word or fratboy sex discussion . But that 's me . Like I said , there are some absolutely hysterical moment here , but you have to ask yourself if they 're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movie you 're likely to ever see at the theater . I just do n't know how interested most woman will be in what 's discussed by men while playing poker . Honestly lady , you might not want to know . If you 've ever been curious why some girl think guy are gross , well , this give you a good idea . There you go - my humble , honest take on what to expect . Be that your guide . It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class , mama , grandmama , any family member of the opposite sex , child of any age , or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion . If you 'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it mean to be uncomfortable .",1
"Saw this a couple time on the Sundance Channel several year ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system . A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern medium culture ( or the lack of it ) , focusing on some seriously wacked , way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dweller . It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo , and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movie . There wa a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart . This film had cult classic written all over it , and I 'm surprised it 's not yet out on DVD . Hopefully soon .",1
"If you liked the first two film , then I 'm sorry to say you 're not going to like this one . This is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video , probably TV made sequel .

Unfortunately his wife want to get rid of a statue , Wayne is so stupid he shrink his statue and himself with his brother . Then he shrink his wife and sister-in-law too . Now the adult have to find a way to get the kid of the house to get them bigger . Pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new thing , e.g . a toy car roller coaster , swimming in dip , etc . Pretty poor !",0
There wa nothing remotely funny about this movie . It make fun of various sport movie and clichés but nothing about it is remotely funny . Most of the movie they parody doe n't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it . Non The main actor wa well cast in it but that 's really the only good thing about this film . Also the various cameo in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage . Thank goodness I only spent $ 4 on it a this is not something worth spending money on . ONly watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minute .,0
"I love this film , it is excellent and so funny , Ben is FIT and i would n't mind meeting him on holiday ! ! I rate this film a 10 because it gr8 and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same . Funny bit is wen Andre is looking at the moon , and he shout at Nicole to 'come outside and look at the moon ' that bit always make me laugh and never get old . Another thing is Nicole look a lot older then 14 ... but shes a gr8 actress . But i need help with something Does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen Nicole and Andre are dancing ? ? ? Its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because it a nice song ! !",1
"Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic ! The Stars ; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried . It 's full of all the magic that a young lady wish for and it make it seem a if it can all really happen to you . The brilliance of the Director ; Blake Edwards is shown to be at his best . He wa truly capturing the woman he loved on screen ! The blend of each song , went perfectly with the moment in the film . The Film opened with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same Song by Andrews . For A Film Of This Excellence To Have Been Such A Failure When It Was Released , Is A Total Shock ... As It Is : `` Inspirational ... Purely .... Inspirational !

Even if you are a die-hard MST3K fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment , think twice about seeing this one . It 's that bad .",0
"If you have n't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minute then give it a couple more minute . Lilia is a widow . She ha been left on the shelf for too long and she want to burst out . She ha a teenage daughter which only highlight that she is not getting any younger . While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared ... the cabaret , where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfit while men throw money at her . The film is very misogamist . It 's portrayal of men is dismal . Which is rather odd a Lilia stoop to jiggle around for them , not for money , but just for the hell of it . When she succeeds in arousing them it make her feel like a woman again . She doe not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention . The other dancer all are mostly aging woman who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived . Not short enough I say . She doe find romance , however brief , with you guessed it .... No surprise here we did n't see coming . Though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way . Maybe this film just is n't targeting my demographic- 30 Male",0
"First of all . I do not look down on Americans . I know lot of people that are intelligent people from the USA . But this Movie is so utterly bad , that i just had to comment on it . First of all ... Movies are mostly far from the truth . This movie is no exception . Lots of scene 's are so incredibly false . For example the departure of the 2 space ship . You see them drop off the full tank in space . Just a small distance from each other . Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? Just a tinsy winsy part that came off . In here it is just common to drop fuel tank that are a big if not bigger then the whole ship . What idiot would let 2 spaceship lift up and do that at the same time ? ? ? Second of it is that the Russian station is a piece of ( s ) crap . I hate to bring this up to you , but astronaut nowadays go to Russia . Since their equipment is much more reliable then NASA 's . The Space Shuttle is retired . And NASA us it just to pay off the bill . And there is no better alternative for it . And the list of whopper go on and on . This is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious . And i know half a much a these guy do . But the most annoying part ( read : the whole movie ) is the Propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with . MY GOD ! ! ! ! I thought i wa looking at a CNN business commercial for like an hour . The actor solve their petty problem by shooting at each other , giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with , start up fight , ignore the police , etc , etc ... But when it come to their love for their country and sacrificing their life , suddenly everyone stand in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ? ? Maybe i lack the feeling of being a true `` Patriot '' , that can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili . Whilst riding with George Bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart , driving in circle until the battery is empty . But this movie wa too much for me too handle . And when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the American flag out of my hiney . I realised that i wa glad this movie wa finally done . I do not know why so much good actor participated in this narrow minded , stereotyping , propaganda movie . But i pity them . This represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power . As long a `` Uncle Sam '' think you are a good patriot . Where everyone is happy a long a it is another country that ha been devastated , no one care .",0
"The sort of `` little '' film which studio used to excel at but seldom make anymore . Sort of a `` soul '' version of the more well-known `` The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells '' . Ian McShane is excellent a a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the member of a classic soul group , and the film follows his exploit a well a those of the group member ; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent a Isaac Hayes , a well a acting stalwart Taurean Blacque , Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas . Not meant to be an epic by any mean , this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold .",1
"I do not like Himesh Reshamiya . I do not like his singing too . But his song are a craze in India , especially among commoner . Now when he ventured to become an actor  that wa a big joke ! What gut he ha to reap a much a he can in his prime time . I did never want to see this movie . But one thing changed it . The movie becoming a super-duper hit ! After 2 week , Aap Ka Saroor ha raked box office collection of 14 crore  compared to Apne that ha collected 7 crore in the same 2 week . If I can sit through Apne and Rajnikant 's absurd Sivaji  I should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie ha got that made it such a big hit ? The story is about the real life singer Himesh Reshamiya ( HR ) who ha gone to Germany for a concert and fall in love with Riya ( Hansika Motwani ) . A German lawyer Ruby ( Mallika Sherawat ) love Himesh . Now Himesh is arrested for a murder . The mission of Himesh ( in last 40 minute ) after he run away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer . Let me say that Himesh ha nothing in him to become a hero . He try hard but fails miserably . He is pathetic . I wa thinking what could have made the movie click so much ? Let me find something positive . First , the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point Himesh run away from the jail . ( But after that the movie nose dive into unbearable stupid limit ) Second , the song of the movie are good , catchy , crowd puller number . Third , Mallika Sherawat  she look gorgeous and act well too , a the second lady . I can imagine fan of Mallika coming to see the movie just for her . Fourth , the cinematography of the movie is pleasing  especially the German locale , are a treat to watch for the eye . Fifth , the major portion of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya  with clichéd dialogue that would probably connect to young crowd . Sixth , the Director Prashant Chadha ha done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skill of Himesh a much a possible with shot that do n't need Himesh to act much . The heroine Hansika Motwani look like a small budget film heroine . Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role . Overall the movie is a below average . I wa thinking throughout the movie  what if the same movie script wa done with Salmaan a the main lead . I think it would have had been a much better affair . May be then I would have given the movie 6 out of 10 . But now ( Stars 4.5 out of 10 )",0
"Even for a tired movie model a the nature vs. man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s , ant fall miserably short of being even somewhat effective ( though entertaining for reason it wa not intending ) . It is sooooo preposterous . Apparently these ant that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decade and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bite - hundred of these bite being fatal . Watching actor of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black speck is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way . So many scene just look ludicrous : a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked , Suzanne Sommers cry out in horror while lounging in bed , Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through piece of wallpaper , Bernie Casey faking a gam leg , and the list go on and on . The peril shown range from ant crawling from a drain to black line of ant all over the wall . The cast for the film is not bad on paper , but none of these actor seem to believe in the material . Poor Myrna Loy ha to sit in a wheelchair through this horror . I hope she found a good use for the money , for it is obvious that wa the ONLY reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense . Although it is quite a bad film , it is watchable - once for me , and doe have many of those seventy bad film quality - start-studded actor embarrassing themselves , that made-for-TV feel , and the dreaded creature of nature reeking vengeance on man . This time man must push his hand into a pile of ant to be affected . Really quite dreadful .",0
"Ghillie a remake of the Telugu `` okkadu ' is thankfully a clarified version of the original . It pack the same punch and Dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache . A flagging Vijay 's career with the entry of the like of Surya and Vikram on the fray , got the much needed uplift with this movie . This might well prove to be the best movie Vijay ha ever been on , considering the choice he ha been making since then . The hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrant being accepted both by the industry and public alike . The tightly snug script , which run at , a neck-break speed revolves around Velu , a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of Kabaddi ( a popular game among boy in India ) . The event following the chance encounter with Muthupandi , his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggle with the aspiration of his friend and his own form the fulcrum and end of the movie . Vijay fit a a 'T ' into the role and essay a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door . Trisha ha more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine mantle to play . The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble . With limited dialog 's , Trisha exploit her occasional muted expression and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role . This is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress . Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie . The movie end on predictable line , although one ha to credit the Director for keeping the audience guessing on many thing including Trisha 's change in decision to leave the country . Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for Vijay 's role . His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chink in the hero 's armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing . Overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing . I give it a clear 8 out of 10 .",1
"The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these day such that it ha at least something to comment on . This film is asinine . It 's like so many other 21st century grind house fodder . The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting . I did n't care about any of the character , but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap : I 'd complain about the money I spent , but my date and I wisely left after 40 minute and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining `` Live Free or Die Hard , '' which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of `` Captivity '' for 40 minute .",0
"This is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original . This sequel is n't nearly a fun a part one , and it instead spends too much time on plot development . Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series , but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry . The performance are all adequate , but this time the script let u down . The action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting , so I need lot of silly laugh in order to stay entertained during a `` Trancers '' movie . Unfortunately , the laugh are few and far between , and so , this film is watchable at best .",0
"A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie . It 's based on a novel of the same title , which wa equally good , though different from the film . Really made you think about how you 'd respond if you were in the shoe of the character . Recommended for anyone who ha ever loved a parent , spouse , or family member -- in other word , EVERYONE ! Though the production is n't quite Hollywood quality -- no big special effect -- still , the value and ideal portrayed more than make up for it . And the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connection between family member , and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill. You do n't want to miss this !",1
"The title suggests that this movie is a sequel to `` An American werewolf in London '' . None of the character from the previous movie return and are n't even mentioned in this movie by name . So a a sequel , AAwiP fails , one would say . I dare to say the opposite . An American werewolf in Paris is a charming , effective horror movie . It 's one of the better werewolf film I have seen in a long time too . And I have seen quite my share , such a An American werewolf in London , The Howling , Wolfen , The Wolfman and the Underworld trilogy . The story tell of three Americans visiting Paris on a vacation . At the top of the Eifel Tower one of them save a woman trying to commit suicide . What start out a a romantic relationship slowly turn into a nightmare when the dark secret that lurk in the city are revealed ... I really liked the acting in this film . Especially the two star of the movie : the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who save her . They have good chemistry together . But the other two Americans also play their role nicely . I did n't really find anything annoying about the acting , so thumb up for that ! The effect on the werewolf are nice . It doe n't look too cheap or fake to me . Of course , the opinion are divided about this subject . But let 's just say that I wa n't disappointed . There 's also a good amount of humor in this movie . There are some really funny scene you will probably remember for a long time . So , to sum it up , An American werewolf in Paris might not be a direct sequel to it 's predecessor , but it 's still an enjoyable movie . Perfect for fan of werewolf ! 7 out of 10 star !",1
"please , future writer , producer , director - learn from this movie ! never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen . bold , because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movie safely avoided - a step to something new , creative and daring . just when you think 'oh , i 've seen this before ' or ' i am sure this is what will happen now ' - StarDust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story . the actor are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fill me with awe for the creator of this movie . Robert De Niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steal the show in each scene he 's in . Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch , and Claire Danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star ' , Yvaine . Other big name make outstanding role . I had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie . But once again , the story by Neil Gaiman , all the little thing he 'invented ' for this universe - simply outstanding . I watched this movie at a pre-screening today , a day before the official release , and do hope it will have huge success . There is so much humor , but also tense moment a well a lovely tender scene . The look in the eye of Yvaine , the 'frivolities ' of Captain Shakespeare , the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive , unforgettable For me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 , watch it and enjoy it 11/10 - Outstanding peace and love",1
"Once again , we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artist ' work ha been fully restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling . Inside are the rich color of all the merchandise , from produce to canned and boxed good to medicine to candy , etc . In essence , this is a story of those good `` coming to life , '' such a the animal on the label of item , or a pie , or even a pack of cigarette . The whole `` show '' is narrated by `` Jack Bunny , '' a Jack Benny impersonator , with music from conductor Leopold Stokowski , who wa in so many Looney Tunes animated short I have lost count . A lot of the humor is topical , so it pay to know who `` Little Egypt '' and other character . The Busby Berkeley-type `` aqua '' number with bathing suited-sardines coming out of the can , and the tomato can-can dance were both clever ! All of the above , and more , wa in the first half of this slightly longer-than-normal length cartoon . The second half wa about a King Kong-type which escape from the `` Animal Crackers '' box and terrorizes everyone . That part wa not much , and ended on a somewhat stupid note . So ..... an `` A '' for the first half , a `` D '' for the second , making it about a C-plus or B-minus overall .",1
"Henry Fool surprised me . I did n't expect it to entertain and amuse a well , or a strongly , a it did . Fay Grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it . Once the viewer watch the first 20 minute of the movie , however , it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the BEST sequel to brilliant indie film . At least a good a Ginger Snaps Back , if not better . I am a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum 's part is so small , but I 'm happy he is a part of this short run . He is convincing and delightful a Agent Fulbright . Also a delight is Liam Aiken who quite aptly portrays Ned Grim , the son of Fay and Henry . This movie is a pleasure for so many reason . I am pleased , for example , to discover that Henry is n't really the loser he seems ( by the end of Fool ) , and to further discover that he is , in fact , a genius ... well , that really is a lovely stroke of the pen . I am hoping they do a third ... like the end of the trilogy . It seems to be missing . They should entitle it Ned Fool Grim and it should be Liam looking for his father , to validate the awesome change in his mother , and the sense of near-genius he himself feel welling inside him . Assuming , of course , that Fay continues withholding many of the most important fact from her son , concerning his father . It feel like it need to be done . I 'd buy it . Even with more action , this is still not an action flick . It is more drama and intrigue ... a mystery , of sort . I 'll watch it often . It rate an 8.3/10 from ... the Fiend : .",1
"So tell me - what serious boozer drink Budweiser ? How many suicidally-obsessed drinker house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drink in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy 's bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast ? And what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inch from his hungry mouth so that the content generally spill all over his face ? Not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend 's tit with it , just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of Elisabeth Shue 's asset . Cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while Shue look more like a Berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker . She is humiliated and subjugated a often a possible in this revolting movie with beating , skin laceration , anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewer an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the 'tart-with-a-heart ' . Still - I did watch it to the end , by which time I wa actually laughing out loud a Shue 's tough street hooker chopped carrot in the kitchen wanly , pathetically smiling while Cage - all eye popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour ...",0
"at first I had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this : that shot of fat people sunbathing , etc were cheap shot in a way . OK so he 's doing diane arbus meet . . . whatever . . . but it wa n't long before I realized that this wa n't being done in a dehumanizing way , a the image unfold I felt that the problem wa entirely the audience 's : we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movie from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly , something that ought not to be shown . if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal . however , the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hit like a ton of brick : very eloquent storytelling , incredible performance , and to think the scene wa improvised . that blonde guy is a genius actor . finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are . the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dance for him is completely an a OK character that break that mold , so do n't oversimplify the film by overlooking him . yes his dog get killed . this ai n't a rosy picture of the world but it 's not . . . completely hopeless . anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all . I would n't say each of the thread were a strong a the strongest , but I say this movie basically kick as and would highly recommend it . . .",1
"One of my absolute favorite childhood film . The Chipmunk adventure pack incredible fun geared for young and old alike . The animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boast some of the best song ever put in an animated feature . Who could forget the dynamic `` Boys/Girls of Rock n ' Roll '' , the exciting `` Diamond Dolls '' , and the heartrending `` My Mother '' ? This should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighty . It 's too bad they do n't make them like this anymore . Most animated film today resort to violence , crude humor , or sentimental mush ... except of course the folk from Pixar . BOTTOM LINE : An amazing and unforgettable adventure for all age .",1
It 's this sort of movie that you try and imitate . By attempting to realise something ... then flying through the air almost immediately . I 'd like to do that and I know you would too ! Great stuff !,1
"A lot of people give this movie a lot of crap , and all of it 's really undeserved . People give this movie a hard time either because it 's such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it . If , just by looking at the cover , you think this movie will make you uncomfortable ... DO N'T WATCH IT ! However , you 'd be missing out on one of the better cinematic experience of the late 1990 's , despite what anyone else say . Dee Snider is wonderful here a Captain Howdy , the depth of insanity he plumb to play this character ha to be beyond word , and is much farther than any one of u would have to be willing to go . The acting here is wonderful . The film itself beautifully shot . The subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow , but it 's still well worth your time . If you have n't seen this movie , check it out .",1
"Today I found `` They All Laughed '' on VHS on sale in a rental . It wa a really old and very used VHS , I had no information about this movie , but I liked the reference listed on it cover : the name of Peter Bogdanovich , Audrey Hepburn , John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me , the price wa very low and I decided to risk and buy it . I searched IMDb , and the User Rating of 6.0 wa an excellent reference . I looked in `` Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003 '' and  wow  four star ! So , I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it . Indeed , I have just finished watching `` They All Laughed '' and I found it a very boring overrated movie . The character are badly developed , and I spent lot of minute to understand their role in the story . The plot is supposed to be funny ( private eye who fall in love for the woman they are chasing ) , but I have not laughed along the whole story . The coincidence , in a huge city like New York , are ridiculous . Ben Gazarra a an attractive and very seductive man , with the woman falling for him a if her were a Brad Pitt , Antonio Banderas or George Clooney , is quite ridiculous . In the end , the greater attraction certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten , murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie , and whose life wa showed in `` Star 80 '' and `` Death of a Centerfold : The Dorothy Stratten Story '' ; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen , the future Mrs. Keith Richards ; the always wonderful , even being fifty-two year old , Audrey Hepburn ; and the song `` Amigo '' , from Roberto Carlos . Although I do not like him , Roberto Carlos ha been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60 's and is called by his fan a `` The King '' . I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attraction ( manly Dorothy Stratten ) . My vote is four . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Muito Riso e Muita Alegria '' ( `` Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness '' )",0
"It amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this . Really . Let 's forget for a second that the plot doe n't even give a single hint of originality ... Most of the movie today are based on other movie ' story , so a `` simple '' lack of originality is not that big a deal . But I can hardly believe that none of the guy involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this . Because , let 's be honest , that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous . To be sincere I think a 6-years-old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable . Some example following . The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engine turn off when they regain control of the plane . When they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio say something like `` Ok , push the 1 and 2 button on the dashboard '' . Now , those are not button . They should not be pushed , they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot . That 's something only plane-addicted would know , you say ? Wrong . The next scene you can see their finger pushing the `` button '' ... And of course the so called `` button '' do n't move at all ! Not even a single millimeter ! ( And note that I have n't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engine are not like car engine , that you just turn the key and the magic happens ... You have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on ... ) Come on guy ! You could have faked the movement at least ! ! Not to mention the hilarious final impact , where the plane crash against every single thing along the runway ( Light pole along the runway ? What where they thinking ? ! ) ... And the wing do n't even get ripped off ! It happened to me too , once ... Except the plane wa made of Lego ! What about the flight attendant ? She 's actually so skilled that she perfectly know where the `` aux 1 '' and `` aux 2 '' fuse are , in the middle of the wire behind the cockpit . Should we mention , then , the guy that can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer ? And how did he turn the other airplane engine on ? Really , I could go on hour with this stuff . This is the dumbest movie I 've ever come across , and I 'm including garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list . Want to do yourself a favor ? Do n't watch it .",0
"Cedric Klapisch 's movie L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is easy , breezy charm wrapped in nostalgia for our younger year and attractive youth . At it core , it 's the feature-length presentation of the long-running MTV reality soap opera known a `` The Real World '' in which , a it motto go : `` This is the 'true story ' of seven stranger picked to live in a house and have their life taped ... so watch what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real . '' This is exactly what happens -- minus the camera planted at every minuscule corner of the house in Barcelona , Spain , where Xavier ( Romain Duris ) come to stay , having to learn Spanish to fill into his job 's requirement . An outsider in many way , he slowly form a camaraderie with his house-mates who come from all corner of Europe except America ... this is a movie in which the only American shown is an unlikable character with whom Wendy ( the adorable Kelly Reilly ) is having an affair with ( `` Only for sex , '' she confesses , since she ha her own boyfriend who make a late but dazed appearance. ) . Throughout his stay there , he try to maintain a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend played by Audrey Tautou while he begin a tentative flirtation with the wife of the owner of the Spanish house where he is staying at and get some advice from a lesbian house-mate ( Cecile de France ) a to how to seduce a woman . A sweet little feature that present a moment in time that twenty-somethings will never see again , L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is forgettable fun containing within itself the threshold into the `` real world '' experienced through Xavier 's eye .",1
"Hitchcock would be proud of this movie . Even when nothing happens , it is suspenseful . Director David Lynch overuse a few cheap thrill trick here and there , but he intersperses them with other cinematographic technique to keep it from becoming obtuse . Altogether surreal , this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible . I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch thing I missed and which may help me understand it better . It is a very detailed plot that very slowly come together , so you must be patient and pay attention . Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it start . And yet , the plot is overshadowed by the theme , the mood , the character development , and the filming technique . The dual role of the main actress , Naomi Watts , showcase her enormous talent . That is , when I could get my eye off of her co-star . What an acting pair . Lynch surprise throughout the movie with unusual camera angle , the length/timing of editing cut , jumping back and forth between scene . Combined with smart use of music and sound , it all help to build suspense in our mind , doubtless a major objective of the director . Well , he kept me on the edge of my seat , even had me talking to the actor to be careful here , and not be so naive there . You know , the kind of stuff you want to smack your kid for doing at the movie .",1
"i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free- thank god , had i paid for it my review would be le forgiving . well , the major idea of the film ( geeky girl take bloody revenge ) is n't all that original , there are several parallel to `` carrie '' ( playing a mean practical joke on a loser , except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her , tamaras and carry bad family background ) . i still think it 's a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they did n't take much advantage of the potential that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong thing . what worked : i liked the actress that played tamara . she looked great ( when she wa hot ) and her catty line were fun ( `` Sean ca n't come to the phone . he 's f * * king patrick ! '' ) . what did n't work : the whole wicca thing wa silly . i generally prefer rational explanation ( she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boy to get her revenge ) . there were a lot of logical whole and the gore looked really bad ( when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue- please ! ! ! ) the whole idea wa n't bound for Oscar buzz , but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had . it wa bearable but far from good !",0
"Yes , this bizarre feature wa written by John Sayles . Shot in Toronto , it 's yet another '80s era feature about the danger of the urban jungle , where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal class are the only inhabitant . Into this mix come the myth of Wild Thing , a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parent were murdered by a dirty cop on the take ( Maury Chaykin ) and Chopper , the local crime lord ( Robert Davi ) . Stir in the local do-gooder ( priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan ) , and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequence . Davi is the standout amongst the cast , and cinematographer Rene Verzier doe a pretty good job . Otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that wo n't satisfy action fan and will leaf Sayles ' admirer slack-jawed .",0
"Absolutely one of the worst movie I have ever seen ! The acting , the dialog , the manuscript , the sound , the lighting , the plot line . I actually ca n't say anything positive about this , although I enjoy Swedish movie . The fighting scene are so ridiculous that it 's impossible to take it seriously . And when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt , while dodging bullet in a strip bar , I 'm not sure if it 's supposed to be a joke , or if someone really think these are ingredient in a good film ? ! Regina Lund is the only half descent actor , but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciation and unbelievable reaction . It leaf you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this ...",0
"`` Plots With A View '' of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the British could do it . The film 's sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick-ish . It 's the only film by director Nick Hurran I 've seen so far , and while I am not intending to watch any of his other film at the moment ( I 'm not a big fan of romantic comedy ) , this one is highly enjoyable and very funny . The film take place in a little town in Wales , where Betty Rhys-Jones ( Brenda Blethyn ) is married to the town 's drunken and adulterous major ( Robert Pugh ) . The local mortician Boris ( Alfred Molina ) ha been desperately in love with Betty since their childhood , but ha always been too shy to confess his love to her . Apart from being desperately in love , Boris ha some other problem , a the eccentric American mortician Frank Featherbed ( Christopher Walken ) ha opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town ... The film 's odd , very British wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor , and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre . Also , `` Plots With A View '' profit from a wonderful cast . Brenda Bethlyn , who ha already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000 's `` Saving Grace '' , play the lead , and she is once again very funny , and very lovable in her role . Alfred Molina , who play her shy admirer , delivers a great performance a always , and Robert Pugh fit perfectly in the role of Betty 's sleazy husband . Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great a the husband 's 'secretary ' , I 'm becoming a bigger fan with every film I see her in . The greatest role , however , is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken ( one of my favorite actor ) . Walken is brilliant a he always is in the role of the eccentric Mortician who arranges funeral that are quite unorthodox . Overall , `` Plots With A View '' is a vastly entertaining little British Comedy that I highly recommend !",1
"I like many others saw this a a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood , I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday , since it originally played on USA network . Does Anyone know where to buy this movie , or doe anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me ? Also doe anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again ? Maybe all of u fan should write a station in hope of them airing it again . I do n't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really know about , people only know of the Stepford wife and Stepford husband movie . No one is familiar with the fact that there wa a child version . Maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller/horror flick . Well if anyone ha any input Please I Beg Of You write me with information . Thanks Taira tcampo23 @ aol.com",1
"I am an actor , producer , director and what i am about to say are fact . This project wa the worst film in movie making history . From producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a BIG joke . Why would Blockbuster released such crap ? I take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession . Was the director trying to make a bad movie ? I do n't think so . I seen bad Zombie movie , but this take the cake the Coffie and everything on the damn table . THIS MOVIE SUCKS ! ! ! I really hate to talk bad about other filmmaker because i am one myself , but please consider in taking up a different profession . I respect the fact that you completed a movie , but i have to ask you `` WERE YOU SMOKING CRACK `` , I mean the makeup on your girl , the scary Zombies , what were you thinking . To the whole nation , if i could have voted Zero i would have . WORST FILM IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORY ! ! !",0
"Good movie are original , some leave a message or touch you in a certain way , but sometimes you 're not in the mood for that . I wanted something simple , no thinking just plain action when I watched this one . It started of good and wa quite entertaining , so why a bad review . Well in the end the movie lost it 's credibility . The storyline wa n't that cheesy at all , the action wa not too special but overall good , acting wa OK , so more than enough to satisfy my need . But all got ruined because thing happened that were over the top , and it left me with a bad feeling . They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the `` no thinking just plain action '' category . So in conclusion if you know you 'll get irritated because thing are happening that seem completely illogical : do n't watch ! otherwise I 'd say go ahead ...",0
"Its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s , but it true . Here another clumsy attempt sputter confuses and alienates would be viewer with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of u who have actually read the story . Irving 's original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge . One can either completely rewrite the story a la Tim Burton which is a discussion for another time , or pad the bust-line of the old girl with unintended detail . The latter is what is attempted here , and if I may say , pitifully so . Unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facet to character personality such a religious zealotry in Crane or wanderlust in good old Bram Bones ruin the story 's intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmaker . By the time the tale 's famous climax approached , I had completely lost interest . Its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background .",0
What a drawn out painful experience . That 's over two hour of my life I will never get back . This Film Festival Director 's delight - is awash with overuse of the long slow shot .... however - that 's not the only thing that make a script . Avoid this movie at all cost .,0

"Ladies and Gentlemen , may we present the worst of all Disney remake . Although the name of this movie is `` That Darn Cat '' , it should have been `` That Darn Teen '' or `` FBI Agent '' . The cat did n't get any real good scene , Ricci 's character wa more annoying than funny , Doug E. Doug did n't get any good line , even Dean Jones 's cameo role could n't save this movie ! The only really good character were the town 's only two auto mechanic , but their scene were only brief . In all , I 'd say that if you are considering watching this movie , go get something more intelligent like a Barney video .",0
saw this movie and totally loved it the character are great . it is definitely my kind of movie you do not get bored in this movie i love independent film they are so much more rewarding . my husband and i really enjoyed Jay 's style . if you are an open minded person who love thought provoking film and love conversation after it 's over you will love this film . it is definitely thought provoking.the film definitely will step on some toe but who care those people will probably not go to see this movie . it is amazing to see the character evolve . Jay Floyd ha really captured both side of the table . Applause applause Jay i hope you are working on another movie .,1
"I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation . Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie , `` The Christmas Box '' based on the book by Richard Paul Evans . I sent out many email to friend and family asking them to please watch this show , hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my `` new '' life . After seeing this movie I wa so disappointed . As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain , I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parent who `` think '' they understand the grief a parent go through who ha lost a child . This movie wa a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton wa a slap in the face to parent who have buried a child . It wa VERY unrealistic from start to stop . I had a few call after the movie , each call the same , `` That wa so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to song on the radio and life is back '' What a bunch of bull ! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark . I guess that 's Hollywood .",0
"Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of character from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail ? If so , this is your movie . This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd . That would be ok , but the story wa poorly executed . Contrived plot twist , poor dialogue and unresolved issue abound . This slight film did not earn the right to be a cryptic a it end up being . Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girl do not have a room there and is about to kick them out . ( This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity a the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint ) . Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city , mind you , Ive been there- and testifies against the girl , a if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 year in prison . C'mon . Rent Another Day in Paradise instead .",0
"Since there have been so many review of this fine film I will write in a list form and attempt to address issue that have not been discussed . 1 . Dana Andrews wa 38 during the filming of this movie . His character according to the screenplay wa in his mid 20 . Andrews , a highly underrated actor , did brilliantly play a character who wa supposed to be much younger . 2 . Fredric March like all GREAT actor need at time to be restrained by the director to avoid over-the-top acting . He wa mugging for the camera when he wa drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he wa checking out his hang over in his mirror . 3 . Dana Andrews wa superb a he wa in `` Laura , '' `` The Ox-Bowl Incident , '' `` A Walk in the Sun , '' `` The Purple Heart '' and many other film . Why did Fredric March win the Academy Award and why wa Dana Andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance ? 4 . Harold Russell gave the best performance I have ever seen by a non actor . 5 . I realize this wa the 1940s but Dana Andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife ( Virginia Mayo ) . 6 . Ray Teal , who played the right wing bigot , year later became famous for portraying the sheriff on `` Bonanza . '' 7 . The professor from the south wrote that the film wa slow moving , boring and poorly acted . The professor more than likely is uninformed about classic film . The beauty and significance of these ageless classic is that they are slow moving character study that avoid profanity , excessive violence and gratuitous sex . * * * I wa surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful .",1
"Alien wa excellent . Many writer tried to copy it . They all did a bad job ( or almost ) . But Dead Space is the worst Alien copy . Because of the bad actor , the bad special effect , the BAD scenario and other bad stuff ( it would take about 3 page to tell everything that is bad in this film . The movie wa n't very long and this is a very good thing ( the only one ) . You can not laugh because it is too serious ... that is a bad thing because , in almost each B-series sci-fi film , you can laugh during the whole time . It can be terrific sometimes , but instead of watching this stupidity , just watch Alien or Event Horizon ... these are much better ! ! ! I give it 1 out of 5 .",0
"OK , this doe n't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part 's opening sequence ; nor to it visual shock value ; nor , for that matter , to the melancholic suspense of the second installment . No , it 's surprisingly and refreshingly different ( apart , of course , from the two main actor ) . The tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drive the character towards each other across genre and language with an almost gravitational force . The moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of : a ) Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume ; b ) sublimation of violence into homo-erotics ; c ) humorous detonation of an impossible buildup . Everything up to then is even le unequivocal . Highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buff who do n't mind following foie gras with a hot dog ; caution to those with more refined palate .",1
"This movie wa a masterpiece of human emotion and experience . I think that a lot of people get caught up in Leland 's apparent mental illness a the storyline , but I wa drawn into the relationship of many of the character and what they reveal about the force of human emotion . Much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad , which is a little cliché , but what make this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have , whether you see the bad everywhere like Leland , or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just is n't going to work no matter how bad you want it to . This movie capture how helpless relationship and emotion can make you feel better than any movie I 've seen , and it is a depressing a movie a it is good .",1
"The man who gave u Splash , Cocoon and Parenthood gave u this incoherent muddle of cliched character , poor plotting , you've-got-to-be-kidding dialogue and melodramatic acting ? I guess everybody ha a bad day at the office now and then . He 's allowed .",0
"There 's hardly anything at all to recommend this movie . Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act , though her role in this clunker is a waste . Unfortunately the rest of the cast range from bad to mediocre . In a lot of film like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference . No such luck here . Creature Unknown '' a clichéd monster-on-the-loose flick with the kid getting knocked off one after the other . The monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the day of Paul Blaisdell . So bad it 's good ! The rest of the show is just so bad it 's bad . A little humor might have made this more palatable , but everyone play the deadly dull material straight up . There is a twist or two at the end , but by then you wo n't care anymore .",0
"Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy . Sadly and annoyingly , here it is , flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land . How did the di-erector get it so wrong ? Well , mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously . Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché ( but somehow cute ) ... or is that cliché piled upon cliché . No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant 's GERRY ..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight ? Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he did n't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own . Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love 's a bore ' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric , we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left . The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible a the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and get stuck there . In Oz in the late 90 some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT . Originally filmed a THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they re-filmed half of it , got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minute and hey-presto .. comedy , tonight ! A lesson there in when bad film turn good by lightening up . I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform , I can understand why .",0
"My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video . Although it had great actors/actresses , there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest . Plus it just wa n't that interesting . Dialogue wa stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable . I wa pretty disappointed in what I believe wa one of Audrey Hepburn 's last movie . I 'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick . He wa just too pathetic here .",0
"The first hour or so of the movie wa mostly boring to say the least . However it improved afterwards a the Valentine Party commenced . Apart from the twist a to the identity of the killer in the very end , the hot bath murder scene wa one of the few relatively memorable aspect of this movie . The scene at the garden with Kate wa well shot and so wa the very last scene ( the 'twist ' ) . In those scene , there wa some genuine suspense and thrill and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty ( the way slasher should be ) edge to it . The earlier murder are frustratingly devoid of gore .",1
"I feel a though I know these people and have known people similar to them . These day , though , people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness .

If you love romantic comedy , but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change { or at least did have back in the 70 's } , then you should see this movie !",1
"Like a twisty country road , `` Tough Luck '' take the viewer for a ride . There is nothing wrong with plot curve , a long a believability doe n't fly out the window . Unfortunately in the end the film doe challenge an audience 's belief tolerance . Nevertheless , it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting , character development , and wonderful carnival atmosphere . Do not expect to like any of the character . Armand Asante , Norman Redus , and Dagmara Dominczyk , play shady con-artists , not exactly the type of person easily admired . The double cross come fast and furious , and the final cross is a bit of a stretch . Recommended . - MERK",1
"Has aged really well - still thrilling and suspenseful today . Certainly one of Hitch 's best movie . Beautifully shot , with a great premise for suspense , sex-appeal provided by beautiful Ruth Roman . Because of the great premise , you feel like you have to watch it to the end . If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title a the Master of Suspense , i recommend this nice little movie a an antidote . 5 out of 5 .",1
"They should have named this movie ... Blonde woman that needed to get their root colored . Also the main character , geeze , the too tight sweater . The giggling . Thought the guy did a good job though . I keep hoping we 'll find a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week . The dart throwing . Had to laugh at that too . We 've still got 3 more on the DVR to watch , maybe we 'll get lucky . Oh yeah , I figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flower and then drove out with his cousin . I told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery . And how stupid wa it that the two gal followed them there spying on them ? Creepy .",0
"This is one of the best movie . It is one of my favorite . A movie with good acting . The story is very sensitive and touching . Good camera work also . The name of the actress and actor are not at the top of the American Star list . However , they give equal or better performance than the top of the list . It is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love , romance , friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world . If you do n't like this movie then you have no heart or feeling . Then go watch a sport movie . There is no killing or horror here . See the movie . It is a must . TH",1
"`` Bell Book and Candle '' wa shown recently on cable . Not having seen it for a while , we decided to take another look at this comedy . Based on the James Van Druten 's Broadway hit , which wa a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifty , the film wa adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash . The film wa directed by Richard Quine , who turned the play into a delightful comedy . Evidently , judging by some of the comment submitted by IMDb , the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two star , who had collaborated on `` Vertigo '' , released the same year . Movie audience did n't think anything about the age difference when this film wa released . In fact , most of the aging male star of that period were always involved with much younger woman . The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that ha enchanted viewer . Kim Novak wa at the height of her beauty a it 's clear the camera adored her no matter what wa she playing . As the witch that becomes human , her Gillian is charming . James Stewart , who play the publisher Shep ' Henderson , is also seen at his best . Mr. Stewart wa an excellent comedy actor who show in here why he wa at the top . In supporting role the wonderful Elsa Lanchester , playing Queenie , is a welcome addition to any movie , a she prof here . Jack Lemmon 's Nicky Holroyd , the brother of Gillian , is also good . Ernie Kovacs is also seen a the writer Sidney Radlitch . This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching `` Bell Book and Candle '' .",1
"It is very hard to come up with new information about JFK Jr. and this fine movie had very little of it , but it wa a joy to watch . The casting wa very good and the script , while somewhat like a documentary , wa also good . My only complaint wa that it wa n't long enough . Perhaps a two-part movie could have told u more about his `` pre-George '' day and his relationship with his mother , sister , and other relative . Some of the material in the book , `` American Son , '' by Richard Blow would have enhanced the movie a lot . WTBS should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie .",1
"This entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - it the best ending of any movie I 've ever seen . Perfect , beautiful , funny , simply wonderful . I found this movie delightful , even with it 's French taking-itself-too-seriously deep meaning thing going on . I loved it - it 's a great love story . And I loved the way Algerians were woven in - and by the way , the music during the final credit is great . I want the CD !",1
"Granted , this seems like a good idea . Steve Martin , Goldie Hawn , and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy . Where can you go wrong ? Watch the movie , and you 'll find out . In truth , Martin , the lead , is mis-cast . He 's not doing the great slapstick he 's known for , from movie like `` The Jerk '' , but instead play a sort of in-between character that doe n't work . Hawn , with no one to play off of , is terrible . Cleese is the only even partially funny member . To top it off , the plot is pretty stupid . I ca n't say how much of it may have been changed , but the character seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense . They blunder through New York , not doing anything right , and unfortuneatly , nothing funny . Not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable , it seems to give the message that people who do n't live in New York are n't very bright , a theme repeated throughout the movie . In summation , instead of seeing this , go rent the original `` Odd Couple '' again .",0
"Halloween 666 ( 1995 ) The producer 's cut review ! Halloween 666 start of with a recap of the horrific ending to Part five . If you thought the last chapter wa dark , this one will really blow your mind . A mysterious `` Man in Black '' ha raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers . In the process poor Jamie Lloyd wa abducted by strange cultist . What they want with her ? Who know , but let 's just say her long suffering will end soon . Doctor Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight year trying to stop Michael Myers from killing any more innocent ( good luck ) . A friend of Loomis , Doctor Wynn come back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor . Another old face from part one guest star a well . This dark and dreary sequel wa dismantled during the post production editing . For some reason the distributor felt that the final product wa n't worth the average horror film watcher 's time . So they decide to dumb it down . Then after having the film sit on the shelf for several month it laid an egg at the box office . No matter what they did to the film , they made it worse . They should have left well enough alone . Hey , the film company know better than the filmmaker now .... do n't they ? Producer 's Cut : Highly recommended Released version : Not recommended",1
"Definitely a `` must see '' for all fan of film noir . Thanks to a fine script and crisp , razor sharp direction a top cast come together and work like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller . Wonderful characterization articulate the movie 's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance . It 's difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there is n't a weak link in the entire company but Robert Ryan a the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling . Making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage . Now , all these year later , at a time when contemporary movie are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language , bare breast , crummy acting and deafening soundtrack it 's refreshing to get back to the basic of quality film making with a viewing treat like `` Crossfire '' . Another low budget gem from the Hollywood archive .",1
"I rented this movie on the merit of what the trailer showed , and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins . If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch , and Timothy Leary to make a movie , this would be the end result . I do n't think I 've seen a movie like it that made an LSD trip look like an episode of Sesame Street . It 's a bunch of set piece where the character flash in and out of reality , or various reality , and the film doe n't culminate into anything until the last 5 minute , where all of a sudden it make sense . I wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially give everything away , and I wo n't do that here . It 's a well acted piece of cinema , and the soundtrack wa written by Sir Anthony Hopkins , and let me say this , if there 's one redeeming feature to this film , it 's the music . It fit perfectly . Some of the dialogue is unbelievably good , and unbelievably bad all at the same time . I enjoyed part of this movie , I truly did , and once you get to the end of it , you 'll actually figure out what 's truly going on . It 's unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hour of crazy to get to a salient point , which minimizes the effect of the entire movie . I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film is n't the acting , it 's everything .",0
"If you are a traveller , if there is a fire burning into your heart , if you 'd call `` home '' every place on earth , but none of them can give you enough , if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there , see this movie and you 'll find out a little , but wonderful , piece of life sitting next to you .",1
"What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this ? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problem in low income area school . While the topic is one that need to be addressed , the film us every cliche in the genre and come off a a textbook popcorn flick . The character are cutout from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty . Watch this with your child when they turn 13 or 14 . With them , it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problem . For anyone older , it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning , a I did recently on Bravo . Matter of fact , what wa this doing on Bravo ?",0
"There are plenty of comment already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short . `` The Grinch '' I thought wa marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented , physical comedian a well a being a versatile clever actor ( in my opinion ) . Mike Myers on the other hand get his laugh by being annoying . I used to like him very much in his `` Waynes World '' and `` So I Married an Axe Murderer '' day - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and `` the Cat In The Hat '' ha just finished me off . This film wa horrible - the gag were horrible ! inappropriate for child not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 year ! The plot wa messy , messy , messy ! Its a shame really because the child were very likeable a wa `` Mom '' . They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it were n't for Myers ugly , revolting over-acted portrayal of the Cat . I mean - did Myers even glance at a script ? Was one written ? The other actor seemed to have one - but the Cat just seemed to be winging it ! On the other hand I would like to mention that the set and prop were marvellous ! ! ! But unfortunately they cant save this film . Poor Dr Seuss - the man wa a genius ! Dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy , messy way ! ! ! 1/10",0
"I 'm surprised about the many female voter who even give this film better mark . My thought about this film wa that the target audience is adult and male . Whipped and tortured woman , merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredient , introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre . The opening and the hand-smashing are DJANGO rip-off . THE SHOOTER however lack the style of e.g . DJANGO . Score , acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredient you are in the right place here . And the actor do n't have an Italian accent . 4 / 10 .",0
"Matthau and Lemmon are at their very best in this one - everyone else in the movie are also great . The Dialogue is excellent and very , very witty - and the scene where Lemmon 's character attempt to clear out his sinus in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time I see it . Anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original . I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it . And the fact the Jack Lemmon play his character so straight forward with tragic overtone only add to the hilariousness in my opinion . These two great guy made a string of movie together , but this one is the best - no doubt .",1
"This is an incredible film . I ca n't remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie this layered . It 's funny , it 's tragic , it 's compelling , and most of all it 's a slice of Swedish small town life . It crush the clichés , and dwells deeper . It make you feel connected , not only to the main character , but to all the character . Big city girl tracing back to her root , her small hometown , to celebrate her father 's 70th birthday , crossing path with people she ha n't met in several year . Although the story itself is n't unique , it offer a fresh approach . The center of the story is the relationship between three sister ( on different stage in life ) , who are n't very close . Or at least do n't realize how close they are . One key reason that make it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast . First , I 'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so-called ' A-list ' Swedish actor in this film . Usually there is a handful of actor that ha the ability to find their way into almost every major production in Sweden . This time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actor who actually seem to love their profession . Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse to prove that you do n't need word to convey an emotion . The writing is also very appealing . The dialogue is more than believable , and compared with other Swedish film from the past year or two , it 's ahead by mile . Maria Blom control everything from the beginning , and if you did n't know , you would never guess that this is her first time writing AND directing a feature length film . I ca n't wait for her next one . Once you start watching this , you really want to see it through .",1
"Just how bad ? Well , compared to this movie , Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane . There 's the stilted acting , the atrocious dialogue , the half baked plot and like it companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that wa actually done . Unlike Holocaust , Ferox is a straight forward movie . It doe n't pretend to be a pseudo documentary . In some way that help the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to Holocaust 's graininess . Unfortunately , we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible . They torture the native and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves . There 's really nothing in this film that make it worth your while . I wa fairly lenient with my review of Holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style , but in Ferox 's case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore .",0
"Some of the secondary actor try , really hard . And camera shot in the desert are quite lovely . Otherwise , this film is horrible . William Shatner 's character , Harvey , is an amateur screenwriter . He 's also a psychopath , a man who quite literally escape from a mental institution . Is the point of this film that amateur screenwriter are psychopath ? Harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie , even if that mean taking a film crew hostage . Do amateur screenwriter ... grovel ? Maybe they do . The film 's setup is way too long . We do n't get to the point of the story until well into the second half . The first half dart and flit among assorted character . `` Shoot Or Be Shot '' is touted a a comedy , but I found it totally not funny . Dialogue contains no subtext . None of the character are believable a real people . They 're all stick figure that perform `` action '' in a way that resembles cartoon character . Indeed , the film is basically a cartoon for adult : silly , inane , birdbrained . I can understand why some actor are in this film . They need the money or the exposure . But what are insider Shatner and Harry Hamlin doing here ? Maybe Shatner want more comedy role . Is this the best he can do ? Is Hamlin that desperate for money ? He used to be a respected actor . What happened ? Even though the story is supposed to be a satire , it come across more a a put-down of amateur screenwriter . Maybe that wa n't the intent . But that 's certainly how the film can be interpreted . As such , the script wa very , very poorly written .",0
"This movie is simply bad . First of all the story is just weird and it 's not good written . It leaf you with question when you 're finished . Sometimes that 's OK , but not in this case . The acting is nothing to write home about . The adult doe a OK job , but the kid , taken in consideration they are kid , doe not a good job . I thought the lead role , Ian Costello a Mickey , wa worst . Well , to be honest I 'm not sure that wa the lead role . Never quite figured who this movie wa about . Mickey or Pete . There were some shot that stood out , but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography . The sound , however , wa better . There wa a nice score . A little adventure kind of score , though this did n't look like an adventure film to me . It had some element of an adventure film , but it wa more of a drama . However , it wa hard to tell who this film wa meant for . Children ? Hardly . There is too much language and violence for that . Adults ? I do n't know . It had to many element of a child 's movie in it . It wa like a adult movie in a child movie wrapping . The story wa just weird . I do n't have much of an idea of what it really wa about . You wa thrown right in to it without knowing anything , but there were all the time reference to something you felt you should know . The fact that the child 's parent were dead for instance and that Mickey blamed Pete for it . You expected to get to know what happened , but you never got . All together this movie wa bad and a waste of time . There wa no drive in it . Nothing to really move the story forward . This is not what you spend your Saturday night on .",0
"Though not Hal Hartley 's best work ( my personal favorite is `` Surviving Desire '' ) , there is still much to like about this movie , especially for fan of Hartley 's dialogue . Even to audience new to Hartley , I would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric `` Dogma . '' This movie is more intelligent , truer to it source material ( the Bible ) , and more fun than any of the other pre-millennium apocalypse movie . This movie is actually part of the French `` 2000 As Seen By . '' ( 2000 Par Vu ) series ; a such , it is perhaps even a lower-budget film than Hartley 's other work . While the need for simple scene shot with digital camera is understandable in this context , the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry/jittery effect . I 'd be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again ; especially at the beginning , it almost make the movie unwatchable . But overlook this flaw , and you 'll be treated to a fine film . Especially notable is Magdalena ( played by P.J . Harvey ) relating how Jesus saved her from being stoned to death ; a short scene I found surprisingly moving . ( Despite the fact that it wa NOT Mary Magdalene that this happened to ; the woman in the Bible wa unnamed . )",1
"I bought this ( it wa only $ 3 , ok ? ) under the title `` Grey Matter '' . The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me . As the other reviewer warned , it 's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry . And yes , there are plenty of establishing shot , especially of a house with a pool in front of it . Some of the character and interior are so nondescript I guess the filmmaker worried we might forget who is who , so they keep tipping u off by first showing the outside of the building . It 's actually kinda funny . After awhile the pool shot feel like a tv channel 's station identification logo , reminding u that we are watching `` Grey Matter '' . I also enjoyed two bout of name-calling . At one point an angry test subject taunt somebody in charge by calling her a `` Scientific b * tch ! '' . It 's just a very inadequate insult . Several scene later a different subject let off steam by muttering about that `` scientific b * * tard ! '' . It just sounded very awkward to me . Someday this movie will disappear forever . Another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copy of it . Almost like it never happened .",0
"There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watch the attempt of December 6 , 1957 ( at least that wa the video used on the TV he wa watching ) which showed the Vangard launch attempt , which failed . He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr . Von Braun offering condolence about the failure . Von Braun wa at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army . The Vanguard project wa by the early Nasa team which wa at what soon became Goddard Space flight center . The army rushed the Jupiter-C , which wa essentially a US made V2 technology , but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia 's success with Sputnik . This error may have actually been made by Homer , because of the notoriety of Von Braun , but his team did n't have their attempt fail . In fact the underlying Redstone wa flying from 52 and wa the first US man rated booster , used for Shepard 's sub orbital flight , a well a Grissom 's . This is why this sort of movie is so good , a it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bit of trivia , and in the process see what ha been done , and be inspired to do more .",1
"I enjoyed this movie very much . Kristy Swanson Omar epps , and Ice Cube were all great in it . The movie dealt with many issue , and I did n't know if I wa going to like it , but Singelton did a terrific job of creating character that you really cared about .",1
"52-Pick Up never got the respect it should have . It work on many level , and ha a complicated but followable plot . The actor involved give some of their finest performance . Ann-Margret , Roy Scheider , and John Glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayal . Notable too are Vanity , who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she show , and Kelly Preston , who 's character will haunt you for a few day . Anyone who like action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this .",1
"Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful film to video that make the viewer give up any expectation of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antic , adolescent humour , and empty writing . This film delivers exactly what it wa trying to deliver . It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sade ( hmmm ) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon . Her sister and brother-in-law , along with an Irish priest , her boyfriend , and a pizza delivery boy , try to save her and exorcise her demon . Well , not much here in way of horror or suspense . In fact , one line from the film pretty much sum up what to expect . Mike ( the girl 's brother-in-law ) ha tied her ( the name is Diane by the way and she is played by Brinke Stevens ) up after trying to chainsaw her sister . He remove a gag from her mouth and say something like , `` This wo n't be the last gag we see tonight . '' Indeed , it wa not . The special effect are cheesy and poorly crafted , and the film make use of this by playing on it comedic appeal . Some of the line and situation are funny . Robert Quarry , old Count Yorga himself , really steal his scene a an Irish priest . He ham it up wailing Biblical verse and crooning Irish song . You know you are in trouble , however , when Eddie Deezen get top billing . Deezen doe his schtick and ha a couple nice moment a well , but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler . Michael Berryman , from The Hills Have Eyes , also ha a brief but interesting cameo in the film . As for the other thespian , well , they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre . Stevens is lovely in fishnet stocking and French-cut panty , but beyond that do n't expect too much more from her . Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun , and she show a bit more than Brinke ( a very lovely young lady by the way ) and out act Brinke by mile . Her husband , played by Jay Richardson show off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity . Again , not a bad film to waste a little time that involves NO thinking on . If you are a Robert Quarry fan , watch it for his performance at the very least .",0
"Wenders wa great with Million $ Hotel.I do n't know how he came up with this film ! The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful , that make it 2 out of ten.But this is not a movie.Is that the best someone can do with a great idea ( the west-east clash ) .There are important thing going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC * with the finger of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity ( because she is just ignorant about the fact ) .The character are not well shaped.And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.At the ending scene Lana say let just be quiet and try to listen.And the background music say `` ... I will pray '' .The thing is not about religion actually.But it end up with this.How you are gon na see the truth if you just close your eye and pray.The light are already shining on the truth.Its just that nobody want to see it . p : `` My home is not a place.It is people '' The only thing that get 10 out of 10 is that sentence.But it is wasted behind this film making . ( by the way ; a `` someone '' mentioned below , Americas finest young man are not finest , they are just the `` poor '' and the `` hopeless '' one who sign up for the army in need of good paycheck which is not provided by the government ! )",0
"As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmaker themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves , we perhaps should n't expect too much from Broken in disc form . And yet what 's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release come with enough extra to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentation . With regard to the latter , the only major flaw is that Broken come with a non-anamorphic transfer . Otherwise we get the film in it original 1.85:1 ratio , demonstrating no technical flaw and looking pretty much a should be expected . Indeed , given Ferrari 's hand on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact . The same is also true of the soundtrack . Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mix and whilst I 'm uncertain a to which should be deemed the `` original '' , the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both mean neither should be considered a inferior . Indeed , though the DD5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score , both are equally fine and free of technical flaw . As for extra the disc is positively overwhelmed by them . Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you 'll notice numerous commentary , load of featurettes and various gallery . Indeed , given the manner in which everything ha been broken down into minute chunk rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary , there really is little to discus . The 'Anatomy of a Stunt ' featurette , for example , is exactly what it claim to be , and the same go for the rest of piece . As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken 's pre-production , production and post-production . And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of ' , in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view . Of the various piece , then , it is perhaps only the commentary which need any kind of discussion . Then again , there 's also a predictable air to each of the chat track . The one involving the actor is overly jokey and doe n't take the film too seriously . Ferrari 's piece are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing . And the technical one are , well , extremely technical . Of course , we also get some crossover with what 's been covered elsewhere on the disc , but at only 19 minute none of these piece outstay their welcome . Indeed , all in all , a fine extra package .",1
"Child 'Sexploitation ' is one of the most serious issue facing our world today and I feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scene of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience . After having seen both 'Trade ' and 'Holly ' , one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international law . The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minute with emotive music and the odd suicide . I do not believe that turning this issue into a Hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I must commend the make of 'Holly ' for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible condition these child are sadly forced to endure . 'Trade ' wavered between serious and stupid with scene involving the death of a cat coming after image that represented child being forced to commit some horrendous act . I found this unengaging and at time offensive to the cause . If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking . For anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually mean something I would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of 'Holly ' .",1
"I will not say much about this film , because there is not much to say , because there is not much there to talk about . The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite character from `` Atlantis : The Lost Empire '' are back . Several of the bad thing about this movie are that it ha horrible character , it ha horrible comedy , horrible animation , and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful , one and only Michael J . Fox a Milo James Thatch . The reason for my criticism are that all the character are changed into something that they never were , and never should be , animation that ha been downgraded to the lowest extent possible , and finally , why would somebody who did wonderful voice-over work for Obi-Wan Kenobi in `` Clone Wars '' want to copy Michael J . Fox ? I happen to have an answer to this . Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II . Yes , sadly , it is true . .",0
"Whoa . In the Twin Cities , we have a station that show a `` Big Bad Movie '' Monday through Friday .

"Although I am a fan of Heather Thomas and I have a few of her old bikini poster around here somewhere , I can honestly say that if the only movie I had ever seen her in wa `` Cyclone '' , I would never be able to guess why she had made it a far a she had in show business . Directed by Fred Olen Ray ( about a good an omen a seeing buzzard circle over head in the desert ) , this tale of a woman ( Thomas ) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous type is about a `` B '' movie a it get ( or in Fred Olen 's case , `` B minus '' ) . The cast itself should tell you something . It 's not every movie that combine Thomas with actor the calibre of Beswick , Hall , Combs , Donahue , Tamblyn and Landau ( ! ! ) . If you 're lucky , very few movie do . And even though they seem to be having fun , should n't some of that fun be passed on to the audience ? I vote yes , seems they voted no . Of course , if you ever wanted to see Heather deliver an uppercut to another woman , use the `` F '' word and get hooked up to battery cable , you 've probably been looking for this one . Myself , I 'll be content with old `` Fall Guy '' rerun . One star , given in hope that when another `` Cyclone '' hit town , Heather run for shelter . I know I will .",0
i am surprised so few have good word for this movie . For it time ( the 80 's ) it wa a very entertaining and engaging story . Casting wa good . Story wa good . Special effect were remarkable for the time period . Deserving of an 8/10 .,1
"Seeing this film , or rather set of film , in my early teen irrevocably changed my idea of the possibility of human interaction and the range of potential experience . This monumental exploration of individual , and their historical setting , reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is . The people are portrayed a they are to themselves : their experience of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomenon are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception . Edgar Reitz display a fabulous appreciation of human motivation and longing . When these phenomenon are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work , one can not help but apprehend the force and vivacity of happiness , defeat , lust , love , sadness , melancholy , that each person feel . When I saw these film I perceived my future experience , how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental event . I acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past life , memory and context . A masterpiece and a revelation . I only wish the BBC would screen it again . If anyone know where I can get a copy , could they contact me",1
"Not the film to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated . If you want to have a lot of fun a the theater , however , this is the one . Lots of snappy banter ( and some really cheesy banter , too ) . Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny a the comic relief . Exciting and creative heist and chase scene . Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron ( sexy ) are appealing lead . And Donald Sutherland !",1
"This is one of the worst film I 've seen for year . The storyline ha potential that is never realized . The actor are a poor choice , but considering the screen writing , their talent is n't wasted . I really wanted everyone dead a quickly a possible so I could get out and watch something else . Unfortunately , I did stay to the end and had a laugh at the murmur of people moaning about how crappy this is . There wa n't booing , after all , this is England , just gentle moan about how crap that wa . Then , I look on IMDb and see 288 people have given it 10 out of 10 . I really just can not see how those people are able to give that score . They must be a PR company working with the distributor . There 's a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film , when in the graveyard and the hick attack , look out for the dodgy scenery that rock when touched ( supposed to be a brick wall ) - the blood effect are waaaay OTT - the film feel like everyone is making a spoof horror except the Director .",0
"Wealthy widower Anthony Steffen ( a Alan Cunningham ) is a sadomasochistic lover , and British Lord . He brings sexy red-haired woman to his castle , where he whip and murder them . Black-booted stripper Erika Blanc ( a Susie ) get away , temporarily . Mr. Steffen is haunted by wife `` Evelyn '' , who died in childbirth . As therapy , he decides to marry again , after meeting pretty blonde Marina Malfatti ( a Gladys ) . By the end of the movie , they will have had to dig a few more graf . `` The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave '' is great title , at least . * * La notte che Evelyn uscì dalla tomba ( 1971 ) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen , Marina Malfatti , Erika Blanc",0
"This is the worst movie I have seen for year ! It start ridicoulus and continues in the same way . I thnik when is something going to happen in this film , , , , and the the acting is worse . The ending lift it a bit and save the movie from a total flop . Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie . Sorry Tim Burton Batman wa good but this one suck .",0
"At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious , on first viewing I 'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'Shaun of the Dead ' . Now , given I view Simon Pegg a an unquestionable comedy genius , I realise this is a rather big claim . And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido ' will appeal to you . In a way the comedy pick up where 'Shaun ' left off , except we 're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town . The Zombie Wars are over and zombie themselves are becoming more well-adjusted , useful member of the community . This , so we 're informed at the outset , is largely thanks to the scientific advance made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps ? The beauty of the film lie in it dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core value while making a place for zombie and the special hazard they pose . The charm and balance with which it doe this is near enough perfect . Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living , keeping up appearance , repressed emotion , muddled parental value , social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual . It 's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film 's all-round strong cast . It 's one of those work where it really show through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part . It 's also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like ... So in conclusion , it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you .",1
"Ugh . Even the ever-popular Diane Lane could not save this movie , and the most exciting thing about the movie wa seeing if Rourke 's face would move . One ha heard so much `` gossip '' about his botched face lift , etc. , so like an accident on the side of the road , we just had to slow down and see the wreck . The plot wa thin . Here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow latch on to a wild and uncontrollable punk/crook , and throughout this movie we 're wondering why this guy stay with this idiot , let alone get together with the guy in the first place . Then the crime that wa not even committed ha the pro to go after the witness . He would have popped them right then and there . But then , we would not have had a movie then , would we ? And why did the realtor even agree to the extortion ? There were more hole in this flick than in my colander . The acting wa horrid , the entire movie predictable down to the minute , and even the ending . And so much could have been done to make this a much better movie . But if you have about 90 minute to kill and not have to use any brain cell in the process , then this movie is just what the doctor ordered .",0
"How Disney can you get ? Preppy rich girl act like idiot , buy a bunch of stuff , and get taught a lesson . Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself ? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human ? Whatever the psycho-analysis , this movie sucked . The girl want a rich party for their rich life . But then money disappears and they have to use their rich to get the milk plant ( yes , milk ) going to employ the worker . They keep it afloat until daddy come home . And the man at the beginning , who appears to be the one that take the money , is the one . But the ending is dumb . Webcam in the Cayman Islands ? Huh ? Not worth my time ever again . But it is better than Howl 's Moving Castle . `` D- ''",0
"If this film is examined closely , it 's a bit sad . It is detailed enough to touch upon very real problem child , who grow up in poor , dysfunctional environment . Yet , it retains it 's comedic value , with spirited performance by Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones . The sadness lie in the struggle and dysfunction of the mother ( Carroll ) , who can not truly help her child , not because she doe n't want to , or try , but because , it 's obvious she doe n't know how . Remember , this is a comedy , but if you 've never seen this , or if you have , watch this film and see the humanity , in the character . Good film .",1
I happen to run into this movie one night so I decided to watch it ! I wa very pleased with the movie ... I thought it wa a wonderful plot . It 's a great feeling knowing a deceased one ha come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say ! And this wife stayed devoted for 23 year ! ! ! I thought it wa a great movie ! !,1
"I went to see this film because Joaquim de Almeida wa in it . Joaquim had a fairly small part , so it wa good that I liked the film on it 's own . In fact , I liked it a lot ! The film center around two character , Albert and Louie . Albert is a shy , retiring sort , and Louie ... well Louie is not . The story revolves around Louie 's request to Albert to let him come over to Albert 's place for just a little while . Louie ha just gotten out of prison . Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood , and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and it 's Albert who always take the fall . The action of the film is based on the adventure that ensue from Louie 's visit . On The Run is a chronicle of mad-cap , zany , situation . However , Bruno de Almeida and scriptwriter , Joseph Minion ( After Hours ) , do n't always take you where you expect to go . There are twist and turn that add depth to this film . Of course there is plenty of outright comedy , but there is much subtle humor here a well . There are some downright good performance here a well . Albert is played delightfully by Michael Imperioli . He 's getting fairly well-knownthese day from the HBO series , The Sopranos . Louie is played by John Ventimiglia , who imbues his character with a lovable , child-like quality . ( no matter what he doe , you just got ta love Louie ! ) . Both these actor are excellent in their individual character . With Imperioli , you 'll want to hug him and bring him home to Mom . Ventimiglia , well , you wo n't know whether you should slap him or bring him home ( and NOT to Mom ! ) . < p > There are other stand-out performance a well . The character of Rita is played by Drena DeNiro ( yes , Robert 's daughter ) . The audience adored her . In talking with the others who saw the film it wa fun to discus whether it wa Albert or Louie who wa their favorite of those two . But , everyone loved Rita ! Is this film perfect ? No , I ca n't say that it is . There were many time I wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with . There were some scene that cried out for more budgetary freedom . ( Give this guy a decent budget to work with and I believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and notice . ) The ending sequence wa a bit of a victim of budget . Yet , budget or no budget , the ending screen shot , in my opinion , brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable , emotionally effective scene .",1
"`` Yes , Georgio '' is a light-hearted and enjoyable movie/comedy that contains beautiful setting and beautiful music . It 's not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once . Some reviewer suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti , they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD . Although , a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarotti 's operatic talent , oftentimes , an opera requires costume and ha story line that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person . `` Yes , Georgio '' permit Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in way an opera would not . Many reviewer seemed to find the story unbelievable ; I do n't agree . Enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people . Additionally , people who are very different from one other often gain insight about themselves and grow in positive way from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in direction they might not have chosen on their own . Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored part of themselves in relationship with the other . Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal ability . The ending scene from Puccini 's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there .",1
"This gem for gore lover is extremely underrated . It 's pure delight and fun ! Gratuitous serving of blood , insanity and black humor , which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre . A full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentist and flawlessly shot . Only for the connoisseur .",1
"I had nothing to do before going out one night so I did n't want to watch anything too heavy , I picked the perfect film . This must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone she slept with , the director Raja Gosnell ha made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious . In what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling ? They let kid all come to the prom with no shirt , in skin tight leotard , as short and one girl wa dressed a Eve wearing only fig leaf ? She announces that she 's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school , parent or lawsuit of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying ? The newspaper bos want to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doe n't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment ? They allow a camera in and record people private conversation with under age kid ? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to HS with a camera on her and filmed under age girl for my personnel use I would not get in some kind of trouble ? ? ? NAHHHH No problem . Did n't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point ? The secondary character in this were like cardboard cutout of what high school student are thought to be and everybody wa a stereotype . Jessica Alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance . In what world do the parent not get suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom ? And they do n't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history . If some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown egg at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life . This movie is so contrived and predictable it 's nauseating , and why at the end is everybody ( the Alpo girl included ) cheering for this chick when two day before they hated her ? ? ? ? DUMB , DUMB AND DUMB .",0
"... but had to see just how bad it could get . The plotline wa thin to begin with , but it just kept getting worse . A female genetic engineering grad student us her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male , because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed off 97 % of the worldwide male population . The surviving men are either high price gigolo in back alley club , or crazed lunatic in run down football stadium plotting to overthrow the 'Lesbian Conspiracy ' . The entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello . Press a few button and ding you get a baby . Not only that , but he will age to mid 20 's in a month , and then begin to age normally ( how convenient ) . Eventually poor Adam get bored with the secluded cabin in the wood where his creator had raised him and steal her car to 'see the city ' . This begin 90 minute of unlikely chase , convenient plot twist , and several subplots that we never see resolved . As Adam quickly learns , what men did survive are treated a outcasts/criminals , because they are dangerous beast that can not help there genetic predisposition to violence . The propaganda machine have been in full swing , scaring woman into believing all men are rapist and murderer . This ha led to lesbianism being the norm , the fall of Christianity , female only reproduction via cloning , and oh yeah world peace among other implied result . All of which seem unlikely given that only ~30 year had elapsed since the war . Adam stumble from one bad situation to the next , all the while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf . With the FBI on his trail , madam looking for fresh meat , and his creator trying to recapture him ( for herself it seems ) , he learns that violence is not limited to the male specie after all . All in all , I would not recommend this movie . I did however enjoy Veronica Cartwrights portrayal of the 'love to hate her ' Director of the FBI , and Julie Bowen did n't do bad a Hope the 'closet hetero ' geneticist either .",0
"The first 45 minute of Dragon Fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable . The character are believable and interesting . The cloning lab look really high-tech . After that , it all collapse . The character start behaving idiotically , and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor ( and this is supposedly `` present day '' ) going critical , the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon - only it doe n't . The finish is incredibly weak . One wonder what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong . All the character except Dean Cain are played by Russians . This result in some weird situation and detail , like the character being played by Vessela Dimitrova being called `` Bailey Kent '' despite her heavy accent ( and despite her , on one occasion , inexplicably switching to * Spanish * ! ) . Because of the decent start , I considered rating this movie a 5 , but it really wa more disappointing than that , so I only give it 4 .",0
"Dr. Bock teach at the hospital and he is quite good at it . The thing about him is that he is depressed . Dr. Bock and his wife separated , his child are deviant , he can not perform in the bedroom and he feel a if he is n't doing a very good job at healing people . He becomes suicidal but meet Barbara who change his idea for the better . All around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protester outside . The movie is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well played out . It 's a little sad , somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama . It wa good to see a couple story wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr. Bock wa doing . Great movie .",1
"I 've been playing this movie incessantly this month , and I just love it . I wa around in the 60 ( oh dear ) , so it is nostalgic in one sense . However , it 's the funny premise , the snappy dialogue and the great performance that keep me watching . Dr. Winston 's reaction to Stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless . ( I 'd be more specific , but do n't want to spoil it for anyone . ) Who other than Matthau can play a man not entirely on the up-and-up and yet have u still love him ? As for Bergman 's costume , I think she look a dowdy a she 's supposed to . I think `` she wa robbed '' the one time that she appears in an evening gown . It doe n't suit her at all , which is too bad . I never liked it when I first saw it on her and I still do n't . Goldie won an Oscar for her role . People thought it wa a groundbreaking performance at the time , and yet it 's the one performance that I do n't love a much a the others . She doe have the right amount of sweetness and likability , however , which is important for this role . And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz wa great in it and it 's too bad that his movie career did n't take off after this . I hope more people watch this movie ... they 'll love it !",1
"WOW ! ! Talk about a film that divide the audience ! This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie . Personally I really enjoyed it . I noticed that other review are comparing it to Pitch Black - this is kinda dumb a the only thing they have in common is SAND ! People can be real stupid . No , this film is far more in common with The Thing ( how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music ) Lots of Carpenter touch are there , blue collar hero , sharp humor , endless rolling landscape full of death and thing not understood . Perhaps what stop this film being a real classic is it 's deference to other Carpenter work . Not least Dark Star which it ha something in common with . I 'd be interested to know how much it REALLY cost ? $ 8000 ? Is that even possible ? Maybe it wa based on a short film that cost $ 8000 ? But I did find myself strangely moved when the various space dude died . They are so underplayed that it 's like watching a documentary at time . Having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and I 'm not sure the big guy playing the Captain is one of them . But his gun is AWESOME ! ! Give it a chance , if you like early Carpenter you might fall for it , just do n't expect 2001 .",1
"This movie try to run away to the typical ' I 'm fighting because I 'm obliged to defend the fatherland . The NAZI 's are all bad guy , I 'm against them ' ( typical of German war movie ) . How ? By not talking too much about it , and just referring the war and the POW 's . Nevertheless I would like to see a German movie which would be something between the extremity of Come And See and the `` bad NAZI 's '' Das Boot . I say this because , excluding this factor , the German movie are the best depicting 2nd world war and the German side . You easily see some of the German hierarchical relation , very different from the one in US army . This is a movie which try to get a real sight of what wa Stalingrad , and I wa not there , and I doubt most people were there now , but if I would choose one movie depicting this battle , for sure would not be the all American Enemy At The Gates . Why do I say this ? Because even the best soldier are not hero 's , and given the condition they may regard their own life instead of the fatherland . This go for all the rank , and in the end you see von Paulus giving the example .",1
"Homelessness ( or Houselessness a George Carlin stated ) ha been an issue for year but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school , work , or vote for the matter . Most people think of the homeless a just a lost cause while worrying about thing such a racism , the war on Iraq , pressuring kid to succeed , technology , the election , inflation , or worrying if they 'll be next to end up on the street . But what if you were given a bet to live on the street for a month without the luxury you once had from a home , the entertainment set , a bathroom , picture on the wall , a computer , and everything you once treasure to see what it 's like to be homeless ? That is Goddard Bolt 's lesson . Mel Brooks ( who directs ) who star a Bolt play a rich man who ha everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival ( Jeffery Tambor ) to see if he can live in the street for thirty day without the luxury ; if Bolt succeeds , he can do what he want with a future project of making more building . The bet 's on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he ca n't step off the sidewalk . He 's given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it 's written on his forehead where Bolt meet other character including a woman by the name of Molly ( Lesley Ann Warren ) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home , and her pal Sailor ( Howard Morris ) and Fumes ( Teddy Wilson ) who are already used to the street . They 're survivor . Bolt is n't . He 's not used to reaching mutual agreement like he once did when being rich where it 's fight or flight , kill or be killed . While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wa n't necessary to plot , I found `` Life Stinks '' to be one of Mel Brooks ' observant film where prior to being a comedy , it show a tender side compared to his slapstick work such a Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein , or Spaceballs for the matter , to show what it 's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do n't know what to do with their money . Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money . Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others .",1
"I a huge fan of when it come to Doctor Who series and still am , But I wa very disappointed when i began to watch this new series . Children under the age of 15 , or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best , and possibly new fan who have n't seen any of the original series , But a far a fan of the original series , will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great , It took David Tennant to get me to Appreciate how Much better Christoper Eccellestion wa a a Doctor in the 1st season . I would only recommend this series for people who have n't seen much of the original series , people who are under 15 , and EXTREMELY DIE HARD who fan , everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse word about Russel T. Davies screwed up one of our favorite TV show .",0
"I went into this film expecting/hoping for a sleazy drive-in style slice of seventy exploitation , but what I got wa more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action . It 's clear that this film wa made on a budget ; the location are drab and poorly shot , while the acting leaf a lot to be desired also . The plot focus on a trio of robber ( a father and two son ) that steal a load of gold after killing some miner . They come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother ... and all this is told in flashback by the young girl , currently residing in an asylum . It 's clear that director Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were making something really shocking ; but despite it best effort , South of Hell Mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer . The film drone on for about eighty minute and most of it consists of boring character spouting off boring and long-winded dialogue . The only good thing I have to say about the film is with regard to the music ; which is good in place . The ending is the only other good thing about the movie ; and that 's only because it 's the last thing that happens . I would n't recommend anyone bother tracking this down ... there wa much better trash made in the seventy .",0
"Looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actor perform . However , I wa sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story . David Duchovny , ( Dr. Eugene Sands ) , '' Connie & Carla '' , '04 , wa the doctor in the story who us drug and loss his license to practice medicine . Dr. Sands wa visiting a night club and wa able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and wa assisted by Angelina Jolie , ( Claire ) , '' Taking Lives '' , '04 , who immediately becomes attracted to Dr. David Sands . Timothy Hutton , ( Raymond Blossom ) , '' Kinsey '' , '04 , play the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kind of money and connection . Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scene and go completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang member from being killed . Gary Dourdan , ( Yates ) , '' CSI-Vegas TV Series '' , play a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a so-called body guard for Raymond Blossom . Angelina Jolie look beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lip which draw a great deal of attention from all the men . This film is not the greatest , but it doe entertain .",0
"This wa one of the worst film I can remember seeing . I am sure I have seen worse , though , if that mitigates me slamming it . The humor is n't funny , there are stupid stereotype joke that , again , are n't funny . I wa a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film . It wa a complete waste of time . I enjoyed Martin in earlier film , but not this one . Same for Queen Latifah , she wa excellent in Chicago and in Set it Off she wa good too , but this role wa horrid . I mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script . I feel strongly you ca n't save a formulaic , unfunny script with decent actor , this movie a a case in point . Still , all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film . I am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted , made , released theatrically , and promoted .",0
"I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally got around to watching it.I really enjoyed watching this film a you do n't get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood film like this . Very well done and but I would say you need to pay attention to what is going on a it is easy to get lost . When you start watching the movie , do n't do anything else ! I would actually advise people to read all the review here ... including the one with spoiler , before watching the movie . Raima Sen gave her first great performance that I have seen . Aishwarya wa easily at her best . All performance were strong , directing and cinematography ... go watch it !",1
"First of all let u discus about the story . It is a copy of the movie `` Hitch '' with an added Indian Flavor to it . One guy , who is a Love guru , and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it come to lady , and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru form the story . Salman Khan is the love guru , and Govinda is the lame guy . Now coming to artist ' performance , Salman Khan overacts throughout the movie , he try to be funny , but fails big time . You can see Salman shouting throughout the movie , no real acting is seen in his performance . Govinda pair opposite Katrina Kaif ( Oh , my god , she is one heck of a girl . A real Beauty ) is in real life a 50 year old dude , and Katrina is a girl in her early twenty . In the movie Govinda look like Grandpa of Katrina Kaif . What a pity ! Coming to Execution of the movie . This movie feel like a B-Movie , and a poor imitation of the movie Hitch . Where Hitch look like a movie with a purpose and depth , this movie is shallow and purposeless , nowhere there is justification or clarity . Just forget this movie , for it is nothing but boring , typical Bollywood fare . Actually I give 3/10 because this is the lowest I go .",0
"I try to catch this film each time it 's shown on tv , which happily is quite often . But I keep forgetting to video it . As it is , I practically know the script by heart , but that doe n't stop me having a good cry , in fact it probably add to it a I cry knowing what 's coming next . It 's such a lovely film - well made , well cast , good photography . I love it . One of my top ten film .",1
"I got to know ÆON back in the early 90 via television and I loved it ... What did you like about it ? The cranky drawing style ? The flawless artistic action involved ? The absurd and deadpan communication between the character ? The whole layout of the surrounding future world ? No matter what you loved about it ... The Aeon Flux film of late 2005 ha nothing of that . Karyn Kusama , the so called `` director '' of the film , wa hopelessly over-strained with transporting the original content to a new film . If you 're not familiar with the original series , you wo n't understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.The story is inscrutable and the vapid character do not develop during the film . Kusama 's attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversation between the main character is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaw a a storyteller , it 's simply unworthy of the original ÆON concept . Charlize Theron might be an attractive woman , but she ca n't impersonate the ÆON character . Although she wa attached to string doing action scene , her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruin the action sequence in the film . The result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cut to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique . Forget about all the rest , it 's not worth talking about ... I give 1point for Ms.Theron showing her boob and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film . That 's it .",0
"I did n't expect much when I rented this movie and it blew me away . If you like good drama , good character development that draw you into a character and make you care about them , you 'll love this movie . Engrossing !",1
This is like something I have NEVER seen before . It had me cracking up the whole time I do n't think there wa one scene that I did n't laugh through . It is about a girl from the country in South who go off to a big town for college . At the school she befriends the RA across the hall . When she realizes that he ha no family to go to for Thanksgiving she invite him to come home with her . Rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do ... Propose . She urge Cral to do something so he stand up and shout something like ... Sorry mate but you are too late I already asked Becca to marry me a couple of week ago back at the school and she said yes . That all turn into Chaos . Please watch this classic it is totally worth it ... I swear .,1
"This off-beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad review . My question is ; why ? I think this movie is pretty good . Dee Snider did very well for his first ( and only ) time directing . He also play the antagonist , Captain Howdy ( Carelton Hendriks ) . This movie seems to have a view of the future . Although it came out back in 1998 , it seems to be about modern issue . Internet predator seems to be the underlying plot here . Although taken to another level , this is an issue which we still face today . I 'll admit , the story fell short a few time , but that doe n't make this a bad movie at all . Robert Englund is even in this movie , that automatically make it better . THe acting wa n't bad , the character were pretty good a well . Hendriks wa a pretty good antagonist I think . I give this off-beat horror a 7/10 . Recommend for fan of Saw .",1
"Armored The best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bum approach you at a red light asking for money , you can shoot them in the face . And while the armoured guard in this thriller are n't using their protective power to purge the drifter population , they are using their position to fleece their employer . When newcomer Ty ( Columbus Short ) land a job with an armored trunk company , he feel like he ha found his lot in life . Unfortunately , however , when he discovers that his co- worker ( Matt Dillon , Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne ) are plotting to take the $ 42 M shipment for themselves , Ty must fortify himself  and the fund  inside the armored truck . A tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned-in performance , Armored is an utterly forgettable film . Besides , if you really want to jack million , it 's a lot simpler to just disguise yourself a an ATM . ( Red Light )",0
"If this film becomes a holiday tradition I am going to have to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life . How do you even think of comparing this with ' A Wonderful Life ' ! It wa absolutely awful ! The boy singing made my toe curl . And what on earth wa the deal with his hair ? ? Emmy worthy performance ? ! Please . Granted , Lucci did OK but an Emmy ? ? ? ? ? I think this film is a waste of money . The fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse . It lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all account . Lighting , wardrobe , make-up , it seemed everybody wanted to go home . Just a big NO from me .",0
"This movie is supposed to be taking place in and around Seattle . The , why is Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park shown ? Provincial park are in CANADA , and not the United States . The Inspector us a Palm Pilot complete with stylus to 'read ' that someone ha hacked into the computer of the bridal shop . I did not know that this wa possible using a database storage device . A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced . We learn half-way into the movie that this woman work in the District Attorney 's office . Then , in the correctional center a guard actually PRECEDES Jenks through a door and keep his back to the offender ! ! This would NEVER happen in a real correctional setting . The director really messed on this one -- this doe n't happen in real life . The acting is adequate . The Plot is good . The Cinematography is good . However , the many error found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote .",0
"The movie wa good . Really the only reason I watched it wa Alan Rickman . Which he did n't pull off the southern accent , but he did pretty well with it.Know Emma Thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent . I like all the character in my opinion not one of them did bad , another thing I have notice . I have read all these comment and not one person ha comment on Alan 5 0'clock shadow . Which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie . I would give the movie a 9 out of 10 . Another one of my opinion is the movie would been better if there wa n't any sex . Still it wa alright . Love the scene were he say `` Aw sh * t '' when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror .",1
"I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontë 's novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC drama . But I 'm very disappointed , I never thought it would be a bad a that : the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me a the novel had . First of all , the music ( and song ) seems totally out of place in a period drama ( sound a if it 's been written for a contemporary horror film ) and like another commentator , I wa particularly annoyed by the way the camera spun and spun round the actor . I 've seen some scene filmed that way in `` North and South '' and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant , it 's definitely overdone and simply annoying . Camera movement can not make wooden acting lively . Most of the second role were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity . None of the character were properly introduced at first . The little boy gave a very good performance , he 's very cute and the best feature of the film . SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald 's characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh , letting no emotion pas through . She doe n't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way . I just could n't believe Markham could have fell for her and I 'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she wa given . I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband ! Fancy being married to such a virago ... Besides , he wa the only main actor that sounded right to me . Toby Stephens I found just OK , Helen Graham 's brother not very good . Maybe it 's difficult to adapt a novel that deal with such bleak subject a alcoholism and cruelty . Besides , what is only hinted at and left to the reader 's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation : making some scene both gross and comic , ( like when Huntingdon 's eye start bleeding ) and others far too sexed up for a period drama ! I mean , do n't we get enough of those bed scene in contemporary drama ?",0
"The gate to Hell ha opened up under Moscow . A priest , played by Vincent Gallo , go to the city to find a friend who ha gone missing in the tunnel under the city in an attempt to find the gateway . Wandering around underground he and his colleague have to deal with the tunnel inhabitant both human and demonic . Good idea with a good cast of second tier actor go nowhere much like the tunnel that are it setting . I 've watched this twice now and I still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow form . Nothing is clear and honestly I did n't see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved ( Second billed Val Kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scene that do n't amount to much other than to allow him to be billed a in the film . ) The idea is really good , the performance are fine , the script go nowhere . Take the advice of several of the character in the film and do n't cross the river to see this .",0
"Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together . The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven . The scene when they meet again in Willy 's flat is a gem and the final scene round up the film to perfection . Walter Matthau give a superb performance a the irascible semi-retired comedian a only he can , the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization . George Burns timing is legendary and nowhere wa it better than in this film , his calm aplomb with desert dry reply are memorable . Watch for the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask something of the Spanish caretaker , and Al 's reaction - priceless .",1
"Warning Spoiler . . . I have to agree with you , it wa almost there . This wa such a bad movie , about such and interesting true story . It had such promise , but the acting wa ridiculous at best . Some set were beautiful and realistic . Others are something out of a theme park . I found myself laughing a I watched , what wa suppose to be , serious scene . I really wanted to like this movie , but I could n't . The best part wa the fight between friend that ended with the `` King '' dying . I liked the Queens ' punishment . And , the final shot made a beautiful picture , though . There are so many better movie to watch . I do n't recommend this .",0
"Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down . We expect a lot more from our movie these day , so it help to remember that audience in the 20 's were a bit more innocent . William Haines is charming a the rogue who ha to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and , even , glory . All of the relationship in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford , the town nerd . The movie ha everything , romance , tear , love , death , and even sport ... It 's a great education in how society ha changed in the 20th century .",1
"I wa skimming over the list of film of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982 . I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that wa just amazingly bad . I remember Richard Burton 's character looking so hopelessly lost , and then remembering how his motivation did n't translate to me . In short , I remember `` Circle of Two '' because it wa so phenomenally awful . This movie came out at a time when America wa going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angle on teenage sexuality . Recall `` The Blue Lagoon '' ( and other Brooke Shields annoyance ) , `` Lipstick '' , `` Little Darlings '' , `` Beau Pere '' and other film that just seemed to dwell on teen having sex , particularly with adult . As a teenager during this time , I found the obsession , combined with the sexual excess of the 70 's and 80 's , made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out , so to speak . `` Circle of Two '' is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient , like `` Blue Lagoon '' . In fact , it tackle the question of love between the young and the old in a brave , if totally failed , way . But honestly , it is one of those film you will * never * see if you did n't see it on it first run because it wa so truly awful . No one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again .",0
"I remember watching American Gothic when it first aired , it came into my mind recently , all I could remember wa the same guy appeared in Midnight Caller , which is Gary Cole , I do n't watch much TV , but I watched American Gothic , I purchased the Complete Series on DVD this week , & it 's still a good a ever , This is one of the best TV series ever , the reason I do n't watch much TV is because it 's just rubbish that 's on , except for Derren Brown , it 's all Reality TV or Soaps , such a Grease , Big Brother etc , i 'm fed up with it , I got the Complete Series of American Gothic for £16.97 form the Asda website , that 's the cheapest I can find it .",1
". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice , bouncy jug running around the so called African jungle . So no problem there for most male out there . I watched it a one of those bundled together package . Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jug on screen at every opportunity possible . Just to give you a sense , our heroine swing from vine to vine and climb on top animal at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jug at all angle . Again , no complaint . The `` fight scene '' are laughable and borderline on the pornographic . Our heroine got caught by the baddie at least five time in the movie . On occasion when she ha to fight , the `` fighting '' involves rolling around in the dirt , grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kitten . I am surprised no hair pulling is involved . It get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the `` combatant '' that `` I said , the one that draw first blood win ! '' in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting . The witch doctor Kuku wa a bloody blast . From being a big , cuddly bear in the beginning , he became manic depressive when captured and then , outright psycho . He spent the whole movie muttering line with no irrelevance . Beside Liana ( our heroine ) bouncing around topless , you also get to see plenty of other Amazonians a well a one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reason . Yeah , it is that kind of movie . Watch the beautiful Liane in her bouncy glory . Despite the movie being more than 20 year old , the allure of watching blond woman flashing their nice jug on screen never get old .",0
"`` Coconut Fred 's Fruit Salad Island ! '' is a hilarious show that is on Saturday morning on WB . It star Coconut Fred and all of his friend on the island , and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs . Most of the time , it is because of Coconut Fred 's trouble making antic which make it funny , and other stuff going on on the island at the same time . The humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all , which add it being a amusing a it is . I do n't think this could be funnier . The voice talent of the character are magnificently superior and are exaggerated , which add to the show 's hilarity . If this is ever on DVD , I 'm getting it A.S.A.P ! Strongly recommended for a good laugh .",1

"This movie , which I just discovered at the video store , ha apparently sit around for a couple of year without a distributor . It 's easy to see why . The story of two friend living in New York searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at Coney Island , ha flash of being a very good film , but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel , rather than on their homeless friend Richie . Cryer is a usual very good and the film ha a nice stark look to it , with the ghostly image of Coney Island . However , writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting life of Stan and Daniel rather than focusing on Richie . One flashback in a music store , where Richie ha a crush on an employee stand out and really show the viewer where this film could have gone . But in the end , not much . Two many drawn out scene of annoyance , such a inside the Skeeball building . RATING 4 out of 10 .",0
"How viewer react to this new `` adaption '' of Shirley Jackson 's book , which wa promoted a NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie ( true enough ) , will be based , I suspect , on the following : those who were big fan of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one ... and those who have never been exposed to either , and who are big fan of Hollywood 's current trend towards `` special effect '' being the first and last word in how `` good '' a film is , are going to love it . Things I did not like about this adaption : 1 . It wa NOT a true adaption of the book . From the article I had read , this movie wa supposed to cover other aspect in the book that the first one never got around to . And , that seemed reasonable , no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND ! ( And not even then ) But , there were thing in this movie that were never by any mean ever mentioned or even hinted at , in the movie . Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING . I did n't like that , either . What the movie 's press release SHOULD have said is ... '' We got the basic , very basic , idea from Shirley Jackson 's book , we kept the same name of the house and several ( though not all ) of the leading character 's name , but then we decided to write our own story , and , what the heck , we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first , and decided to throw in a bit of them , too . '' 2 . They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brush with the paranormal in their past , to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been `` born bad '' . No , instead , this `` doctor '' got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their `` insomnia '' ( he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear ... like lab rat , who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment ... nice guy ) . This doctor , who did not have the same name , by the way , wa a different from the dedicated professional of the original movie a night from day . 3 . In direct contrast to the statement that wa used to promote both movie `` some house are just born bad '' , this house wa not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there ... and , this time around , Nel get to unravel the mystery ( shade of THE CHANGELING ) . The only problem wa , the so-called mystery wa so incoherently told that I 'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience ... but , then there wa no mystery in the first place ( not in the book ) , because the house wa bad TO BEGIN WITH . It 's first `` victim '' died before ever setting eye on it . 4 . The way the character of Luke wa portrayed wa absolutely ridiculous . He wa supposed to be a debonair playboy who wa someday to inherit the house ( and wa a true skeptic of it 's `` history '' ) ... and in this one he wa just a winey-voiced , bumbling nerd who could n't sleep ( insomnia remember ) and wa a compulsive liar . 5 . I wa also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scene word for word ( the scene with Nel 's sister 's family , and Mrs. Dudley 's little opening speech ... ) to going off into flight of fancy that made me think more of these other movie than THE HAUNTING . It 's like it could n't make up it mind what it wanted to do . 6 . I missed Nel 's narrative through the whole movie . The original wa so like a gothic novel in the way that the story wa mostly told in the first person , through Nel 's eye , and we always were privy to her thought . That totally unique touch wa completely lost in the new version . They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine . The original Nel wa not a bad person , but she wa a bitter person ( could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 year of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister ? ) and she liked to moan , and she lost her temper ... This one wa almost too good to be true . This wa never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer 's had obviously been watching GHOST one too many time . 7 . They changed the history of the house and it 's occupents too much . There wa no Abigail Crain ( the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original version ) , there wa no `` companion '' , and there wa no nursery . There wa also no `` Grace '' ( wife of the original doctor ) and Hugh Crain 's wife died in totally different way . These change , changed the story WAY too much . I do n't know whether the producer of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walk this earth or whether they should ... BE SORRY ( if ya get my drift ! ! ! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with ! ! ! ) . In conclusion , let me just leave you with some word from the original Luke ( appropriate substitution of the word `` house '' for `` movie '' ! ) : `` This 'movie ' should be burnt to the ground , and the ground sprinkled with salt ! '' My favorite movie of all time remains so . No competition from this one .",0
"As a fan of Wm . Faulkner since college , I wa especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reason . My grandfather , also named Clarence Brown a wa the director , grew up in the Oxford area having been born near there in 1888 . We attended a week long family reunion at Oxford in July , 1964 a mere 15 year after filming the movie . It still looked mostly like it doe in the film but wa going thru a period of civil right upheaval then a the site of Ole Miss . My recollection is of it being a nice little college town that summer but I wa just an 18 year old college sophomore and white . I wa just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go . Anyhow , the movie is well worth watching but the filmmaker must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and I would love to know more about that story . Now day , Oxford is a larger , more modern college town with all the ill that go along with such thing and I hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus year . Juano Hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an Oscar that year but Hollywood wa still to bigoted itself to let that happen . Other Faulkner story have been filmed so look for them and compare . One of the best wa a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so starring Tommy Lee Jones . It really captured the intensity of rural Southern white that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so often .",1
"I just caught `` Farewell to the King '' on cable , and maybe it 's just because I 'm a girl , but I thought this wa on the craptastic side . The script and direction are pretentious ( once I found out John Milius wa responsible , it all became clear ) . The supporting actor actually were n't bad - James Fox wa outstanding . The biggest disappointment wa Nick Nolte , who I usually enjoy . Once he go native , he start speaking a very stiff , stilted English , and half the time , he seems kind of distracted , a if he 'd just smoked some of the bounty of Borneo 's rain forest . And then the end -- what the ? ? ? Learoyd just happens to be on the same boat a The Botanist ( by the way , had the Botanist dumped the girlfriend , or what ? ) ? ? ? The boat just happens to run aground conveniently close to an island ripe takeover by a crazy Anglo ex-headhunting Army deserter ? ?",0
"A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics make this a treat to watch and enjoy . Director-writer Brian de Palma doe a super Hitchcock-imitation ( many called it a `` ripoff '' ) with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work ( and several scene with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tape ) . The downside of the movie , at least to anyone that ha some kind of moral standard , is the general sleaziness of all the character , including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz ( who ha hair here ! ) . The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit , even 25 year after it release . The film ha several erotic scene in it a Dickinson ( if that is really her on the closeup ) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their body . There is not much dialog in the first 20 minute and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder . The first 36 minute are riveting and even though it 's apparent who the killer is , it 's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through , particularly for male ogling the naked woman .",1
"Choose your fate : The terrible tyke of the fourth form , playing practical joke that involve ax , or the ... ummm ... well-developed girl of the sixth form , who discovered some time ago cigarette , gin , sex and how easily men can be led astray . The problem is that one set come with the other . They are all there at St. Trinian 's , that remarkably easy-going English school for girl led by headmistress Millicent Fritton ( Alastair Sim ) . As Miss Fritton is fond of pointing out , `` In other school girl are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world , but when our girl leave here , it is the merciless world which ha to be prepared . '' Miss Fritton sound something like a melding of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt , and definitely ha Sim 's droll and deadpan comic gene . In The Belles of St. Trinian 's , a sly , chaotic comedy from the team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat , St. Trinian 's is , a usual , on the brink of financial disaster . Salvation may be at hand , however , when a rich sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper English education . The sheik also is a horse owner and one of his prize racer , Arab Boy , is being trained near the school for a race . It 's only a matter of time before the fourth- form girl form a racing pool and bet heavily on Arab Boy , with Miss Fritton adding to the pool what fund the school ha left . ( Much of the fourth-form girl 's money come from the gin they make in chemistry , then bottle and lower by rope to Flash Harry ( George Cole ) , a Cockney fixer , for distribution . `` It 's got something ... I do n't know quite what , '' say Miss Fritton on sampling the stuff , `` but send a few bottle up to my room . '' ) Miss Fritton , however , ha a brother , Clarence Fritton ( who , by some coincidence of casting , also is Alastair Sim ) , a bookmaker who not only ha placed a bundle on another horse , but who also ha a daughter . And he ha placed the precocious Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed . Soon the sixth form ha kidnapped Arab Boy , the fourth form ha taken the horse back , Flash Harry ha joined force with Miss Fritton , the sixth-form girl are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian 's , Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived , parent are driving up for Parent 's Day and the Ministry of Education ha arrived in the person of a very proper inspector . Total war break out at St. Trinian 's . It 's hard to say which is more dangerous , the African spear or the flour bomb . Alastair Sim a Millicent Fritton turn in a tour de force performance . Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom , fond of long gown with embroidered lace and Edwardian hat with lot of feather . She take everything in stride , even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and , after hearing an explosion a few minute later , the result . `` Oh dear . I told Bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine ! '' She is firm in believing that St. Trinian 's is `` a gay arcadia of happy girl . '' Sim wa one of Britain 's great eccentric actor . Other than the sheer chaos of all the little ( and not so little ) girl doing terrible thing , he delivers much of the film 's pleasure .",1
"This movie wa absolutely wonderful . The pre-partition time and culture ha been recreated beautifully . Urmila ha given yet another brilliant performance . What I truly admire about this movie is that it doe n't resort to Pakistan-bashing that is running rampant in movie like Gadar and LOC . With the partition a a backdrop , the movie doe not divert to political issue or focus on violence or what is right and wrong . The movie always center around the tragic story of Urmila 's life . Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai ha been depicted excellently . The movie actually show how the people , both Hindus and Muslims , have suffered from this partition . The theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film .",1

"I 'm surprised that no one yet ha mentioned that there are two version of this same film . The lion 's share of the footage in both is identical , but here is where they differ : In one version ( the version I have seen most often on broadcast TV ) , the group of cleric guarding the gateway consists of the `` Brotherhood of the Protectors '' , a ( fictional ) splinter group of priest and brother `` excommunicated '' by the Church . In the other version , which I 've seen only once on TV , the cleric guarding the gateway are depicted a priest of the official Church , meaning the Archdiocese of New York ( or perhaps Brooklyn ) . Also , in the former version , in most of the pertinent scene , the cleric are referred to a `` brother '' ( and in some scene , you can see where the lip say `` Father '' so-and-so but the dubbed audio say `` Brother '' so-and-so . In the latter version , I believe everyone is referred to a `` Father '' . In any event , it seems that one of these two version is more or le a partial re-shooting of the other , with all `` Brotherhood of the Protector '' scene re-shot a `` Archdiocese '' scene , or vice versa . ( Kind of reminds me of the Raymond Burr cutaway scene in `` Godzilla '' ) . I have videotaped both version off broadcast TV , so no , I 'm not imagining this . Can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two version of the film ?",1
"There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover , no ASIN , VFC 19796 on the disk , no IFPI code in the inner rim . Probably a straight transfer from VHS . There is no much point is commenting an adult film . But this one contains a minimal plot , and the character are believable . It wa shown in the United States in normal cinema . I 've seen it In Pensylvannia way back in 1975 . As such it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies . The DVD ha no special feature and no subtitle , and wa probably made using a VHS tape a source",0
"Do n't watch this film while , or soon after , eating . Having said that , Begotten will stick with you for the rest of your life , like it or not . Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man spasming above ground ( to paraphrase the title sequence/introduction ) , this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery you 'll ever see in a film . There is no dialogue , only image after image describing the cycle of life . The film 's combination of stark black and white photography compounded with some truly creepy background sound work to drive home the maker 's message . The movie begin with God ( portrayed a a bandaged and obviously insane man ) slicing open his torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth . After his death , Mother Nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate herself with his blood and semen and give birth to Man , represented by a maggot of a human convulsing on the earth . The landscape is a barren waste , populated by hulking shrouded humanoid who eventually happen upon Mother Nature and Man . After a slew of violent scene depicting the rape of Nature and destruction of Man , these humanoid proceed to pound the remains of the corps back into the ground , and the cycle of life begin anew . I actually rented this from Blockbuster one night , based on the cover art and hype content , but this is definitely not a Blockbuster-type film . Do n't expect narrative , dialogue or any pulled punch . This is intense imagery based on a dark subject . I give this movie some high mark for the filmwork and audio , but I do n't think I 'll be watching it too often , if again . I like my movie dark and unique , but this one is exponentially more than I expected .",1
"This cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff , courtesy of spaghetti land director Lamberto Bava , who wisely left his name off this junk . The basic crux of this outing concern the discovery of some brutally mutilated individual being washed-up on shore in the Caribbean . Authorities initially believe them to be victim of shark attack , but a the investigation unravels , turn out to be something much more sinister . All of this ultimately amount to very little however , we have here - poor dubbing complimented by similarly weak script , which often consists of nonsensical jabbering , and is really of little consequence for the most part . Acting can only be described a sub-par , which is par for the course in this instance . Truly lax direction doe n't help thing either . Special effect mainly is for numerous close-ups of various gory body missing limb , and so forth . Of course , there is the obligatory creature which periodically emerges at feeding time , which look something like a big monster octopus thing , where it animation only consists of it pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation . Overall , the end result is none too convincing , sure , but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion . It seems what the film maker were going for wa a sort of low-rent hybrid of Jaws and Piranha , but the final product is just a bloody shamble , much like the corps incessantly shown throughout this picture . I find it difficult to think of any redeeming attribute to warrant viewing this , so moreover , strictly for incurable monster movie addict .",0
"Walt Disney 's 20th animated feature wa the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself ( he died in late 1966 ) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output . The main problem is that , on the surface , the film seems merely to be the feline version of either LADY AND THE TRAMP ( 1955 ) or 101 DALMATIONS ( 1961 ) both of which are certainly more beloved by fan Even so , being both an animation and cat lover , I dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat ( voiced by Eva Gabor ) and her three little kitten are thrown out onto the street of Paris by a wealthy lady ( Hermione Baddeley ) 's greedy butler . Luckily , they meet a streetwise alley cat ( Phil Harris ) who guide them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band ( led by Scatman Crothers ) and two helpful and amiably dopey dog ; meanwhile at home , Edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pet . Legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier wa whisked back from retirement to sing the title song ( which includes a verse in French ) and Scatman 's band indulge in a breezy number `` Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat '' .",1
"I first saw this movie at a video store and , being the Bam Margera fan I am , had to rent it to see what it wa all about . Since I have a huge and stupid ( note the word stupid ) sense of humor , I found this movie absolutely hilarious . Some of the part are pointless and random , but that 's what make them so amusing . You 'll need to think thing like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie . I wa really impressed . I wa also surprised at the acting . These people actually did a good job . Nothing Oscar worthy , but well enough to get past the amateur level . Teens and young adult would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situation used . I would n't suggest watching this with your parent and vice versa . All in all , the acting wa great , the script wa hilarious , and the story is really something you can relate to .",1
"I loved it , it wa really gruesome and disgusting . I thought that the tearing of the human flesh wa thoroughly provacative . the way that it wa depicting the human crucifix about Jesus Christ wa really interesting . The tearing about limb and jaw wa awesome brutally gruesome . Do n't watch this if you have a weak heart , you would n't be able to stand it .",1
"Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin 's Dolemite . This is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity . Rudy Ray Moore , in a role that transcends Academy Awards star a Dolemite , the baddest cat in the universe . He clearly doe not take any jive from no turkey ( I myself am unfortunately a turkey ) and prof it with his power of rapping , pimping , and karate chopping . This is blaxploitation at it absolute finest , a shining example of the genre with it low budget , continuity error , and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive . The true Godfather of Rap ( not this new Ali nonsense ) Moore is something of a juxtaposition of acting technique ; somehow managing to be the most charismatic awful actor of the 1970 's , and thats saying something . This one is HIGHLY recommended folk , if not for the one-liner alone .",1
"OK. On the whole , this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with going 's on in the world of physic , and the last 300 year of discovery of our universe . If you have read Stephen Hawkings brilliant book `` A Brief History of Time '' and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concept .. which i did to a certain extent . Greene is bearable , but obviously for the sake of the mass , tends to explain thing in a slighty patronising way . This is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watch this series . The guest scientist were good . ( no Hawking , but i suppose he ha his own DVD ( s ) ) I kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same one for almost 3 part ... ( very American weighted here , with a few Brits and one antipodean ) I bought the Nova 2 Disc edition ( NTSC ) and there were a few inclusion that really detracted from the overall experience . 1 . The `` this is brought to you by .. '' at the start of EACH part wa a necessary evil for the first part , but seeing it 2 more time before It wa over wa very ordinary . 2 . Ca n't be helped I suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the FFW button a few time . 3 . This disc set wa straight from TV .. ( ie ad , what happen last show for those that missed it , and frequent `` goto pbs.org for more .... '' ) appearing throughout the presentation . ( quite unlike BBC material which is unmatched for presentation .. Planets , The Blue Planet , etc ) My 7/10 is based on content alone . The niggles were there but I got over them . If this had have been done with that classic British accented presenter ( you know the one ) it would be a perfect Disc set in my opinion . If you have seen this and want more ... then I highly recommend Hawkings book `` a Brief History of Time '' ... I wish it wa a movie too . Happy viewing .",1
"Another Woo 's masterpiece ! This is a best wuxie film i 'm ever seen ! Woo - RULEZ forever ( except some Hollywood moment ... ) . John Woo - greater director of the century . Maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of Big Directors ... But he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free-mind people ! His movie like the great poetry ! Woo is a Movie Sheakspeare ! Woo is a Movie Biron ! Woo is a Mozart of Bloodshet ! ! ! ! IMHO violent in Woo film is not a director bloodlust , but a instrument of art .

It 's so good see a show where all the character work well together and they treat each other with respect .

"Some unsuspecting film carry a message that resonates in the hour and day after viewing . Such is the case for CAROL 'S JOURNEY ( EL VIAJE DE CAROL ) , a beautifully crafted 2002 film from Spain based on the novel ' A boca de noche ' by Ángel García Roldán who also adapted the book a a screenplay . War and it consequence are not new subject matter for film , but when that war theme play in the background a a subtle driving force to develop character ( especially child ) who must face adult life influenced by the game of adult , the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre . Carol ( Clara Lago ) is a 12-year-old Spanish American youngster from New York who with her critically ill mother Aurora ( María Barranco ) return to her Aurora 's home in 1938 at the height of the Spanish Civil War , a home that ha been left deserted by her father Don Amalio ( Álvaro de Luna ) since his wife 's death . Carol 's father Robert ( Ben Temple ) is a fighter pilot who ha sided with the Republicans against Franco and is rarely with his family . Aurora ha a past : she left her lover Alfonso ( Alberto Jiménez ) to marry Robert , and Alfonso in turn married Aurora 's cold sister Dolores ( Lucina Gil ) . Carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather Don Amalio until she meet others her age but not of her 'class ' : Tomiche ( Juan José Ballesta ) and his two friend at first resent Carol , but a event develop Carol and Tomiche are bonded by what feel like the first awakening of love . When Aurora dy of her illness , Carol must live with Alfonso and Dolores and their daughter Blanca ( Luna McGill ) , yet turn to her grandfather for support and to her mother 's best friend and teacher Maruja ( the always radiant Rosa Maria Sardà ) to understand the disparity between class and the senseless war that keep her beloved father from her side . Through a series of incident Carol and Tomiche learn the rigor of becoming adult , facing more trauma in a brief period of the war than most of u experience in a lifetime . The ending , though sad , is uplifting a Carol 's journey to maturity is complete . The film is shot in Galicia and Portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful setting captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer Gonzalo F. Berridi and enhanced by the musical score by Bingen Mendizábal . Director Imanol Uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos , and in electing to concentrate the story on the child involved , he make an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war . The cast is exceptional : the star clearly are young Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta , but they are supported by the fine veteran actor in the adult role . This is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it ha to this date . Grady Harp",1
"ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman 's score . It 's haunting and beautiful but you 're aware that this music is similar to Newman 's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you 're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you 're reminded of other film a the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangster is MILLER 'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone 's gangster epic . Despite having a seen it all before feel this should n't be taken a a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaw that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minute and I wa slightly confused a the event that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their life you ca n't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performance . I 've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he 's every bit a good here a he ha been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman play a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I wa watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman 's performance work due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milk it or go over the top . While never upstaging Newman who give the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actor Craig and Law are also very memorable a American gangster and while Law will still have a long career a a leading actor one wonder how Daniel Craig might have progressed a a character actor if he had n't decided to become James Bond , a role which herald the end of an actor career",1
"The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor a Christy Brown , guinea artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds . As a person who did work with patient with cerebral palsy , I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing . The enormous support that Christy got form his family , low-income , working class Dubliners , encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book , but the dialog were written wisely to capture Christy Brown 's witty arrogant personality . I do recommend this movie to everyone , especially to classic movie-lovers .",1
"I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie . He came out with a handful of good movie then descending into poor story , bad camera work and a walk-thru persona , he nearly lost me . A few movie ago he remembered how to make a decent movie . Now he 's forgotten again . This film is seriously dark ( on any level you care to name ) . There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it 's meant a a warning against the military . Seagall may have had a stand-in for many of his scene a it wa often too dark to tell and someone else 's voice wa used most of the time . Sadly the only interesting character wa the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place . Okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner ? Anyway this bad guy wa at least colorful , and very focused . There 's lot of gore if you like that king of thing . It looked to me like the bad guy tore the same gash every time . I 'm just glad they did n't suck the blood from their hapless victim . I harken you back to my summary . Basically it is a horror movie disguised a an action film.Dec 6,2006",0
"Absolutely stunning , warmth for the head and the heart . The kind of movie western movie maker are too rushed , too frenetic to even attempt . My kid watched it , and they loved it too .

"I recently saw this film at a 3-D film festival in Hollywood . It wa in polarized 3-D ( Gray glass not red & blue ) It wa so much fun to watch this film with an audience , the print wa excellent and the 3-D perfect . The performance were over the top and that added to the fun , the surprise ending ( that we are n't supposed to share with fellow movie go'ers , at least according to the movie trailer and poster ) had people howling with laughter . By today 's standard this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3-D ( complete with cobweb and bat coming out of the screen ) this film wa an entertaining romp into 50 's horror .",1
"Michael Stearns play Mike , a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality . He ha no problem ogling naked dancer but when woman start having sex with men that 's when he loses it . He belief that when woman actually have sex that 's when they lose any sense of `` innocence '' and/or `` beauty '' . So he stroll through the Hollywood Hills stalking lovemaking couple at a distance , ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scope . The seeming primary reason for this movie 's existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again . The `` story '' come off a more of an afterthought . This is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased a we 're treated to enough protracted scene of nudity ( the lady here look awfully good sans clothes ) and sex to serve a a major dose of titillation . Of course , seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism . ( For one thing , Mike eye the couple through the scope for minute at a time before finally pulling the trigger . ) This is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack . Those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another . It even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds Mike and render him uncertain * how * to react . It unfolds at a very slow pace , but wrap up with a most amusing ironic twist . It 's a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewer glued to the screen . 7/10",1
"I saw this film a a kid about 30 year ago , and I have n't forgotten it to this day . I could n't say whether it 's a good picture . But in those day I instantly fell in love with Jean Simmons . The memory concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie , but I still remember the plot . Simmons wa very young then , and there is another film that gave me the same feeling : David Lean 's GREAT EXPECTATIONS . And again it wa the young Jean Simmons . It 's a pity that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video ; I 'd like to correct my memory ...",1
"Feels like an impressionistic film ; if there is such a thing . The story is well told , very poetic . the character well developed and well acted by the interpreter ( or interpreted by the actor : ) ) . The film delight in it own sumptuous emotion at time and work well , unless you hate such emotion in movie - not so in my case . It 's a very humanistic film . The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right . Well done . A good classic for any good film collection .",1
"Oh , how I laughed during those first couple of scene . This silly little film about an 11 year-old who carry a gun , steal car , robs store , burglar house , extorts money from other kid , burn house , shoot rat , buy drug , distributes drug to his mother and his friend , and then kill a guy . What a great comedy ! But it wa n't intended to be a comedy . It wa intended a a social drama . How can this be ? The event in this film are absurd and ridiculous . The character are all stereotype right out of a 4 year-old 's comic-strip-induced immature imagination . The dialog is laughable ; people talk like moron . It 's a very dumb film . The first scene are indeed very funny , for all the wrong reason . But the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise run out after a short while , and after that the laugh come only rarely ; by that time the viewer ca n't believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows ( if he ha at least half a brain cell ) . A short film , but feel like an eternity . The film actually IS a seriously-intended attempt to show the world of a young degenerate , while imitating movie vastly superior to it , like `` Fun '' . There is just such an air of phoniness about everything ; the kid , the adult , everyone lack credibility both in their action and dialog . The kid in the lead mug his way through the film a though he had seen all the Jimmy Cagney movie at least a hundred time . And , typically enough , the kid is n't portrayed a a reservoir of evil , but , instead , a a misunderstood little artistic talent . But of course . Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society made him bad . Poor child . The film is embarrassing ; a collection of stale , occasionally hilarious clichés put together to make a movie that lack intelligence and meaning . The intellectual level of the film is zero .",0
"Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through . It detail the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby ( S. Epatha Merkerson ) . Rachel is referred to a Nanny by all who know her , but she could have just a easily been called Wonder Woman . She epitomized strength , will power , confidence and resolve . She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject . Her tenant consisted of a lesbian , a psychotic war veteran , an amputee , and a host of other vagrant that made the home mile away from ordinary . Each successive event Rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly . She wa n't a dictator devoid of compassion , but in fact she wa quite the opposite . She displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself . Merkerson did a good job , but I believe this role wa right up her alley anyway . The movie had an even keel never straying from Rachel . There were of course dramatic moment but they were to be expected . Nothing wa ever to shocking or profound other than Rachel herself .",1
"San Francisco is a big city with great acting credit . In this one , the filmmaker made no attempt to use the city . They did n't even manage the most basic of realistic detail . So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie . You will not be thinking `` oh , I 've been there , '' you will be thinking `` how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby ? '' Some of the lead used East Coast speech style and affectation . It detracts , but the acting wa always competent . The story seemed to be shot in three distinct style , at least in the beginning . The Chinatown story wa the most effective and interesting . The plot is weak , ripped scene for scene from classy Hong Kong action movie . The original had a lot more tension and emotional resonance , they were framed and paced better . But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminary . The white boy intro wa pointless . I think the filmmaker did n't know what to do with it , so they left it loosely structured and cut it down . The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley liberal - really , folk , everyone know it 's not `` groovy '' to live in the ghetto - but his segment are the most humorous . They threw away some good opportunity . Educated and embittered on the West Coast , a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in New York . They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable . That would have been interesting ; this wa not . The Hunter 's Point intro wa the most disappointing . It wa the most derivative of the three , and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco . You 've seen it done before and you 've seen it done better . Even the video game wa better ! Despite the generic non-locality and aimless script , these character have potential , the actor have talent , and something interesting start to force it way around the clumsy direction ... about ten minute before the ending . Good concept placed in the wrong hand . PS , there is a missing minority here , see if you can guess which one .",0
"No Holds Barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten wa the coolest movie this side of arnold schwarzenegger .

"This movie stink majorly . The only reason I gave it a 3 wa because the graphic were semi charming . It 's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawing . This is by far THE worse anime that came out of Japan . I ca n't believe they actually put their name on this garbage . What a rip off selling this thing for $ 20 . If you have n't seen this do n't bother . If you have , I pity you .",0
"This is probably one of the best Portuguese movie I ever saw ... I absolutely enjoyed the plot , because by the way the story wa developing , you would get more involved on how their world wa really upside-down ... There is just only one part that doe n't really seem to fit in the movie , which is the girl ' strip ... It doe not add anything important to the story , it look like it 's just there for a men entertaining purpose . The ending is a bit unexpected , though , at the same time , somewhat expected . If you do n't understand , then follow me : after so many strange occurrence , the viewer is so used to oddity , that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationship ( Like Mimoso and Susana ) sound totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie . But , most of all , Sorte Nula is a movie that make you think hard trying to solve the mysterious occourings , laugh your head off with their unlucky life and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minute , when you turn your back away from something ... for all that , I rate it 8/10",1

"There are two kind of 1950s musical . First you have the glossy MGM production with big name and great music . And then you have the minor league with a le famous cast , le famous music and second rate director . 'The Girl Ca n't Help It ' belongs to the latter category . Neither Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield wa famous for her ... well , never mind . Seems like every decade ha it share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons . The plot itself is thin a a razorblade and one ca n't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell record for Fats Domino , Little Richard or others of the 1950s rock act that appear in the movie . If that music appeal to you this is worth watching . If not , do n't bother .",0

"Okay people , I have to agree with almost everyone else 's review here . The character . Are . Stupid . They 're ALL stereotypical , and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny . Do n't even get me started on Jamie Lynn 's role a ZOEY . Zoey is a pretty , popular , tan , blonde young teen who everyone just LOVES ! She ha a `` rebellious '' , great , personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is . Most annoying of all : her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious . `` OMG ! '' Take for example the first episode . The moment she step onto the huge PCA campus , everyone seems to love her . The boy want to ask her out , the girl want to be her friend , etc . Thinking she 's all that , the episode play out with Zoey always being the center of attention ; she is the so-called best player of the unofficial girl basketball team , confident , and ha everyone pity her when she weakly get hit in the face . Oh boo-hoo . My favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show , Lauren or something , who is the ONLY person ever introduced in the show to hate Zoey . And Zoey doe n't even seem to be very loyal to her friend sometimes . In one episode she even call her friend a freak without EVER apologizing and doe n't show the least bit regret in doing so . Zoey is ALWAYS the best : -Desiging professional T-shirts and backpack ( which become a big hit ) -coming up with VERY elaborate scheme BY HERSELF to teach a single person a lesson . -Flawless grade -Taking the blame for stuff that wa n't even related to her just so everyone else could be happy . -Coming up with a commercial that wa so good it wa put on TV . The list go on and on ... Ugh . She ha no acting talent . She 's always the perfect person . She act snotty and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH ! Ca n't stand her . Not only that , but everyone in the show always ha great clothes . EVEN THE NERD ! Her wardrobe is better than mine , and mine is pretty freaking decent . No one care if everyone at PCA love you , Zoey , and would do anything for you , even if it meant giving their right arm . BUT regardless of these cardboard character , the plot are creative . Not everyday thing . They 're interesting and amusing . The humor is usually good-natured and fun , but the character are so paper flat that it 's hard to enjoy it . This show would be really good if Dan Schnieder put a bit more time thinking of the type of character he wanted , because they are so typical , so boring that 's it 's lame and stupid . Point : No one 's the least bit overweight , everyone ha stylish clothes , Zoey is the definition of Mary-sue , the story line are well-thought out , and the humor is laughable . But again , I want to emphasize that the character taint the show . Watch the show if you must , but do n't say I did n't warn you if your eye start to bleed .",0

He arrives ( Carver is also a helicopter pilot ) with the lead Scientist and we soon find out it 's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone . Is it a Dinosaur or what ?

"If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it , then Tigerland is the film for you . I love this movie from top to bottom . This movie 's picture-perfect scene look so real ; it 's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama . Boy , I tell you ... REAL drama they actually real `` fought '' in one of the scene ( get the DVD listen to the commentary it not obvious ) . I see this film a a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill-fated destiny , after watching Saving Private Ryan I have an a appreciation of what an `` ill-fated destiny '' is and know exactly how the men in the film feel . I see this movie a a crossbreed between `` Stand By Me '' and `` Saving Private Ryan . '' What do men do when they are with a situation that 's `` hard pressed '' in real life ? Some men go crazy , some men cry , some men through fist , others do drug , some randomly sleep with hooker ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life , some try drink the pain away , some jump off building or bridge , some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it make them so sick they collapse - physically . This movie ha all those desperate emotion rolled into one ball . But do n't get me wrong it not depressing movie , it realistic , it a very very humorous movie , the cocky and funny Bozz ( Collin 's Character ) light it all up , and on top of that there are about 5 female actress in the movie ; I 'll let you figure out what their in there for ! With dialogue , war/action sequence , picture perfect scene along with appropriate music ; this movie ha it all , like I said : from top to bottom . I do n't why Tigerland is heavily under-credited . The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it say in big bold writing `` The best film of the year , '' and it absolutely fall nothing short of that . Keep the rare gem coming Hollywood , 10/10 .",1
"This is one particular Stooge short that actually us satire in conjunction with slapstick , a rarity . As mentioned , the title and concept for this short wa `` borrowed '' from a feature film from the same year with Clark Gable called `` Men In White '' . It 's basically about the trial and tribulation of intern and their sacred cause for `` duty and humanity '' . I saw this recently and almost treated it like the Stooge version because it doe take itself a little too seriously . In any case , `` Men In Black '' is so well written , directed and not to mention original , it did n't borrow a thing from Chaplin or any of the others , that the Motion Picture Academy nominated it for an award a the best short comedy of 1934 . Some stinky short called `` La Cucaracha '' outdid it though and stole the award . Some producer 's brother in law must have been on the Academy 's voting board . `` Men In Black '' poke fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the Marx Bros. always did at this time . May not be a fair comparison but I can see the Marx Bros. in this short . In fact in their feature `` A Day At The Races '' , there is a scene where there 's `` medical thing '' going on and they cause anarchy a usual . My guess that this particular short wa judged along those line and hence why it wa nominated in the first place . Try this in fact : watch this short first and then watch `` Duck Soup '' or `` Day at the Races '' with the Marxes and then see if there is n't the same great quality of comedy .",1
"I can name only a few movie that I have seen which were this bad . This movie ha terrible everything : The dialog is corny and cliché ' , the acting is poor for the most part with a few exception , the cinematography is nothing to cheer about , and the plot is silly ( A fat woman stalk a suburban family because her daughter did n't make the soccer team ) . This is so bad , it 's funny to watch . If you can catch this on lifetime , I 'd recommend it highly a a comedy . As for being a serious movie , I 'm afraid i 'll have to rate this a 2 . Do n't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline , or good acting . There is none to be found . Edit : Hmmm ... I think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony review and voted all the negative one down . Do n't believe them . This is a really crappy movie .",0
"when i first read about `` berlin am meer '' i did n't expect much . but i thought with the right people , the right location , the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about . but eissler failed , it 's so ridiculously unauthentic . it 's a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlin 's so called scene . of course it 's not all about hippness , but you should expect more from a movie that 's being sold a `` the definite berlin movie '' . and apart from all the credibility stuff , it really is a bad movie . mediocre acting and a rather boring plot . interestingly some of the actor have proved in other movie that they are actually quite talented . so it really must be poor directing skill . do n't bother watching `` berlin am meer '' unless you are 17 , come from some small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school . then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool .",0
I got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first of the series when I wa a kid . I 'd rented the second one and it wa a decent `` B '' sci-fi . This one wa out right obnoxious . The `` special '' effect on the car looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done . The two assistant female cyborg were so terrible that I literally cringed every time they came on the screen . The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick . I do n't know what anyone wa thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but I 'm sure that they 'd have done better to have left it at 2 movie . The movie in this series are going from good to decent to terrible . I only hope that no terrorist group have access to this movie a it make an excellent torturing device .,0
"waste of my life , .... the director should be embarrassed . why people feel they need to make worthless movie will never make sense to me . when she died at the end , it made me laugh . i had to change the channel many time throughout the film because i wa getting embarrassed watching such poor acting . hopefully the guy who played Heath never get work again . On top of that i hope the director never get to make another film , and ha his paycheck taken back for this crap . { .02 out of 10 }",0
"A good x evil film with taste of `` James Bond '' , `` Romeo and Juliet '' , and , maybe , even `` Star Wars '' . The evil count Von Bruno receives an English gentleman a a guest for a very dangerous hunt . Elga , the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that wa forced to marry the count provides the love triangle . The count missing eye point to a terrible past . The Englishman is not what the count think and is a terrible treat to him . There is also the terrible hunchback , crocodile and even the side appearance of some torture instrument . Boris Karlloff , here in a support role , make an strong , but somewhat stiff , presence . The other actor ( and direction ) are the symbol of an era the strong representation of black and white movie . Since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy , who is the good one . Even traitor and stiff can be identified somewhat easily .",1
"There is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst I have seen in some time . As F. Scott Fitzgerald ( Gregory Peck ) and Sheilah Graham ( Deborah Kerr ) are lounging on the beach , suddenly thing become tense and Sheilah begin to cry -- at which point she tell her lover about her sordid past . This `` dramatic scene '' becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic I could n't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all wa ... a dramatic music swelled on the television a it all came to a phony crescendo . NO ONE experience moment like this -- no one . Now how much of the rest of the film is true , I can not say , but this particular moment wa laughably bad and a fake a an $ 8 Rolex -- and lead me to assume that some of the other reviewer were correct -- the film is a lot of bunk . However , I am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet did n't seem to clear this up , either . Just who were F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what wa their relationship really like ? What I do know about Fitzgerald , however , doe seem different from what I saw in the film . Was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film ? Well , considering he wa married at the same time he wa carrying on with Graham and drank like a fish , I 'd assume he wa n't . Was he a obnoxious and boorish a we later see in the film ? Perhaps , but if he wa this bad AND yet Ms. Graham stayed with him , then this make her out to be a complete dummy -- and not someone you 'd like to see featured in a film . And , if he wa n't , then the film doe a poor disservice to his memory . Either way , it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience . The sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people . In a dark and salacious way , some might find this all very entertaining , but most are sure to see this a a train wreck with no surprise along the way ! Unpleasant but with glossy production value ( especially the music , which wa lovely but way over the top ) it begs the question `` why did they even choose to make this in the first place ? '' . The bottom line -- it 's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time -- even if , like me , you are big Gregory Peck fan .",0
A powerful `` real-tv '' movie . Very subversive and therefore remaining almost un-broadcasted ! ( almost ... thanx 2 arte in France ) . After you 've watched this manhunt all movie filmed with the same concept ( a documentary team following the event a they arrived ) seem so weak . DAVID,1
"This type of plot really doe have a lot of potential , but it wa butchered here . Honestly , I sensed the cheese element in the beginning , but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing . Whoa , I wa wrong ! So mad scientist make a monster , want to brag to his old crony before he kill them , but of course they escape . After that , it 's really bad . I should 've counted the time the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage , but I most likely would have lost count . Pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show u how the shark-man find the folk . I hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film . Oh , and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island , there 's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare ... This is one where you 'll find yourself rooting for the monster ... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick .",0
"At the end of my review of Cache , I wrote that I wa intrigued with Haneke a a film maker . This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste , which I just finished watching about a half hour ago . It 's all been expressed , here at IMDb and in many of the external review - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create ' an individual like Huppert 's Erika , who is still trying , after year and year , to please her mother , at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life , beginning with her self . She 's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage , including , of course , her sexuality , which ha literally imploded , to the point of madness , to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like . This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple , one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult . I think this subject relates to all of u - we 're all striving for autonomy , but there are need , so many conflicting need , most of which are not even on the conscious level . It also deal brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about , sexually , and the reality of those fantasy , a well a the consequence of choosing to share one 's sexual fantasy with another human being . Huppert 's character get what she asks for in the course of the film , and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be . Regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom : I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge ( for the viewer , I mean ) sucked out of it because of the prior scene , where she put the glass in the girl 's pocket . By the time she 's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom , we 've already found out that she 's dangerously disturbed and so it 's not a turn on , her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe . I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how , about halfway through it , I completely forgot that it wa not in English and that I wa reading sub-titles . That ha never happened before , in any foreign movie , and I 've seen quite a few . In this film , like Cache , the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow , but unlike Cache , we do at least get some sense of finality , despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Huppert 's character is alive or dead . After experiencing La Pianiste , when it come to Michael Haneke , I am , needle to say , more than a trifle intrigued .",1
"This series had potential , but I suppose the budget would n't allow it to see that potential . An interesting setup , not dissimilar to `` lost '' it fall flat after the 1st episode . The whole series , 6 episode , could have made a compelling 90 minute film , but the maker chose to drag it on and on . Many of the scene were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward . The music wa very annoying and did not work overall . There were few character we cared about a their character did not grow during the time frame -- - well , one grew a bit . The ending wa a terrible a the rest of series . The only kudos here is to the art dept and set dresser , they created an interesting look , too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element",0
"Independent film that would make Hollywood proud . The movie substitute good look for good acting , a cryptic plot for a good story line , and self-absorption for character development . May be I missed something , go see it for yourself .",0
"Most of you out there really disliked this movie ... you were right . A small minority of you really loved the movie ... ca n't say you ' re wrong . For me , this movie wa too stupid . I have seen many dumb , silly comedy but this one surpasses every one of them . As I wa watching I could n't stop rubbing my eye , not believing what I wa seeing and trying to decide if I should laugh or cry , a * REALLY STUPID * stuff were going on on the screen , and people were leaving the theater . According to the leading character , time travel is accomplished , just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past . Plus , if you are seeking an after death experience , just go to the nearest planetarium , there you shall meet Lord - sorry , Loydd and be given important command ... All te above doesn ' t really make sense , right ? Well , go ahead , watch the movie ( I almost never regret the movie I watch ) , you probably wo n't like it , but you will be intrigued by the writer 's ability in producing the ultimately STUPID script ... I ' m giving it a 3 out of 10 , not good , far from being the worse ...",0
"Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series . And , while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun , I really do have to cast my vote a this Romulan episode a being the very best . The movie , interestingly enough , is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounce back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise a it seek to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outpost . In so many way , the show is much like the film THE ENEMY BELOW -- where the American Captain ( Robert Mitchum ) and the German Captain ( Curt Jurgens ) are shown in counter-point a they both try to outwit the other -- and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe . Interestingly enough , only a short bit of the beginning of the episode take place on a planet -- and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull . But , because the writing wa so fantastic and the main character written and acted so well ( Shatner and Mark Leonard a the Romulan leader ) . Oddly , for the die-hard Trekkers out there , they 'll recognize Leonard a the same actor who later played Spock 's father . The bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat .",1

"After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn . A sick film that wa NOT funny and wa NOT worth the money , any money at all . If anybody ever want to see this movie do n't ! Your kid will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week . So if you value your child 's education and want to stimulate your child 's mind please do n't see this movie . I beg of you , DO N'T !",0
"This wa one of my favorite a a child . My family had the 8-track tape soundtrack ! ! It took u year ( until I wa in my 20 ) for u to get a video of the movie ( my dad taped it from HBO or something ) .

"I have to confess that I know some of those involved , I wa in the forerunner to The Planet , Evil Unleased , however this wa more than 10 year ago and I had since lost contact with them . I happened to be watching BBC Scotland News and a piece regarding Scottish Cinema , this mentioned and showed clip from The Planet and comment from it 's director Mark Stirton , this prompted me to order a copy of the film on DVD . Now to the film , the level of acting , writing , directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around , OK it 's not Star Wars but I 've seen many a Hollywood product that is far inferior . It is very strange watching a film spoken in my local North East Scotland accent but that soon passed . ^Mild Spoilers^ The Planet draw on several sci-fi classic ; Star Wars , Alien , Pitch Black , Forbidden Planet and Predator , a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ship , they escape onto a deserted desert planet , one by one they are killed by invisible attacker , the ship only passenger , a mysterious prisoner also make it to the planet , a battle ensues a the crew fight to survive . The Planet is a brilliant piece of sci-fi film making that certainly hide it 's limited budget , well done to Mark , Mike and all those involved , I look forward to your next work .",1
"I purchased a DVD of this film for a dollar at the big dept store . That 's probably the best and kindest comment I have to offer on it . At least it did n't cheat me out of the cost of lunch . The problem with `` Chiller '' is Craven 's problem a a director . The man ha his apologist who claim his traveling paper prove he 's a really smart guy and all-around sharp conceptualist . But it 's no secret that , a a director , he ha never possessed one iota of the visual and story-telling sense of a Hitchcock . As vigorously attested by `` Chiller '' , he 's much closer to that legendary flat-foot Hershel Gordon Lewis . What Craven lack a a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film- making . Let 's be specific . The transitional moment of this film are sleek . The establishing shot give it the feel of a quality production . The film look professionally put together , in the way a film shot by a TV commercial director would . ( A thought : The film only visual distinction , these transition that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit director . ) It 's the part between the bridge and smooth transition -- the drama -- that fall flat . The core of the proceeding are invariably perfunctorily handled . The critical shot ( after , say , the departing car drive into the well-positioned camera , then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital , then to the waiting area and hallway , then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action ) are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part . Craven never come anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibility of any moment . The net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important part , and the fumbling rush to keep thing moving , is a film that feel like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencil , fussily adjusts his easel and lighting set-up , grind all his pigment , stretch and prime his canvas ... and then ha nothing to say . Craven , like the art student , never get to the meat of the exercise . For Craven apologist who will point out that this film wa made for TV , I will point to Spielberg 's `` Duel '' and say no more .",0
"Excellent . Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the Western plain with an emphasis on the woman 's role and place . A moving film , lovingly made , and based on real people and their actual experience . Low budget , independent film ; never made any money . Definitely not the romanticized , unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life .",1
"I wa taken to this film by a friend and wa sceptical about a Swedish film with subtitle . However , I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film . The unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of wa portrayed confidently without overwhelming image - although animal lover may have to shield their eye for a brief couple of second somewhere during the first 10 minute . A traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy wa illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of character with very natural flaw and feature . I particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspect of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias , discrimination and sanctimonious pretence . An absolute gem of a film that I will promote to all who will listen .",1
"`` Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey '' is one of those wonderful old movie about house pet . Deserves a place among the great movie of it genre and even the cinema world in general , together with other animal movie like `` Old Yeller '' , `` Napoleon '' , `` Fluke '' and `` Air Bud '' . This mean it is more than just a movie about pet . Can this possibly be just a `` remake '' ? It is too good to be a `` remake '' ! I know this one by heart , since my early teen year ( when I wa 12 ) . It 's a family movie to treasure . It 's emotional , thrilling , adventurous , exciting , entertaining , humorous , charming , sweet , nostalgic , beautiful , heartwarming and sometimes dramatic . It 's one of those movie to put a smile on the face of those who appreciate this kind of film . This movie doe not lack quality . It ha a well thought story , enjoyable character , excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack , dazzling sceneries/landscapes of the magnificent Sierra mountain ( in Oregon ) . Speaking of the vista , it 's not all mountain : forest , tree , river , waterfall , sunset ... in conclusion , all of pure nature 's wonder - truly a full panorama . The main human character are nice , well developed and well portrayed by respective actor . Robert Hays is awesome a the kind-hearted dad , Bob Seaver . Kim Greist is good a Laura Burnford . Veronica Lauren is equally good a Hope . Kevin Chevalia is conventional a the youngest and cute brother Jamie ( his appearance actually reminds me very much of Kevin Corcoran in `` Old Yeller '' ) . Benj Thall is great a Peter Burnford . When it come to our quadruped pal , Shadow is my favorite . Shadow is the loyal , wise , mature , beautiful , caring and loving old Golden Retriever ( brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche ) . Chance , the American Bulldog , is the opposite of Shadow . He is carefree , silly , impatient , anxious , clumsy , hilarious and love to play ( voiced by the talented Michael J . Fox ) . Chance just ca n't stand still . Sassy is the epitome of cat 's image : elegant , independent , very confident and self-proud , with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm . Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat , one of the most beautiful cat breed . Sassy is voiced by Sally Field , who also doe a good job . Our four-legged friend are , themselves , great `` actor '' by nature : Ben a Shadow , Rattler a Chance and Tiki a Sassy . It 's an underrated movie , but a classic by it own right . Its sequel is clearly inferior . This should definitely be on Top 250 .",1
"To review this movie , I without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in Tarantino 's `` Pulp Fiction '' ( 1994 ) when Jules and Vincent are talking about Mia Wallace and what she doe for a living . Jules tell Vincent that the `` Only thing she did worthwhile wa pilot '' . Vincent asks `` What the hell is a pilot ? '' and Jules go into a very well description of what a TV pilot is : `` Well , the way they make show is , they make one show . That show 's called a 'pilot ' . Then they show that show to the people who make show , and on the strength of that one show they decide if they 're going to make more show . Some pilot get picked and become television program . Some do n't , become nothing . She starred in one of the one that became nothing . '' Now to stretch on what Jules wa talking about , there are BILLIONS of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not ... well , good . Probably the most notorious pilot that come to mind is `` W * A * L * T * E * R '' , a spin-off to `` M * A * S * H '' with Gary `` Radar '' Burghoff a the lead . Hmmm , would somebody really want to be watching Radar for a half-hour trying to solve crime ? Hence , the show wa never picked up . What many people do n't know ( or what they thought they knew ) is that pilot are hardly ever shown on the air , for they are made strictly for the Television network for them to decide . Some have made they 're way past and got onto the air ( The pilot for the animated series `` American Dad '' come to mind , a the show 's serial itself did n't begin until nearly four month later . However , there are time were we should all be glad pilot never make it to air , and this here is why . `` Black Bart '' , a supposed tie-in with the Mel Brooks comedy classic , `` Blazing Saddles '' , is a stale and bland `` sitcom '' with little heart and no soul . `` Saddles '' wa a controversial comedy , nevertheless , with it 's racist humor and vulgar comedy , which come to mind `` what idiot decided this would make a great television show FOR PRIME TIME TV ? ! ? '' I say `` supposed '' , because none of the memorable character from the movie , aside from Bart , on in this mess of a TV show . Mel Brooks wa n't even involved with the production of the serial and this wa the first mistake in a long line ( In a related story , I recently found out about an unaired TV pilot for a series based on the movie `` Clerks . '' that Kevin Smith wa no involved in .... you see what happens ? ! ? ) . Set somewhere around the same time a the movie ( or at all ) , the story circle around the only Black sheriff in the wild west , named appropriately 'Black ' Bart , who is this time played by future Academy Award winner Louis Gossett Jr. , obviously before his stint in `` real '' acting , whereas in this he is playing a `` G-rated '' Richard Pryor . Most of the other character are carbon ( if not , really bad ) copy of the character in the movie : Jim , The Waco Kid is replaced by a similar looking character named Reb Jordan , a former Confederate soldier who is quick with the gun . Lilian Von Schtupp is now Belle Buzzer , a more of a ripoff of the character being that she 's a show dancer and a German with a Marlene Dietrich-type accent and personality . While that 's pretty much the end in similarity , The lead `` bad guy '' in the story is Fern Malaga , played by Noble Willingham , who I assumed would 've been Hedley Lamar if Warner Bros. secured the right to the name ( See trivia for `` Blazing Saddles '' ) and his son Curley ... I dunno , Taggart I suppose ? The story is a poor excuse for a sitcom , much le a pilot . Bart deal with the mayor 's drunk son and he 's out-of-control behavior which ha caused the town to spin . Really , it 's a story that try to introduce all the character in the `` series '' and doe n't focus on the variety and context that would make this an `` alright '' show . I ca n't really call it a sitcom ( and even if I wanted to ) and that 's primarily the fact it wa shot on the backlot at Warner Bros. Studios and later added a laugh track , so the show is set up almost exactly like `` M * A * S * H '' ( complete with a bland and dull `` laughing '' that is identical to the series ) . The acting is so-so , but there 's one part that always make me laugh , and that 's when the actor playing Reb Jordan almost seems to forget his line and try really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue . HA ! The script is rather dull and is attempt to make racism more humorous than it wa in the movie ( Surprisingly , they use the word `` N * * * er '' numerous amount of time through a 22-minute episode , rather touchy for it 's time period and even for today ) and it get repetitive . If you ever get your hand on this unseen piece of sss ... surly interesting novelty item , watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilot ( It 's on the collector 's edition of `` Blazing Saddles '' , God know why ) . There , yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilot never air .",0
"Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized . As usual the plot is wafer thin , from 1 foot tall dinosaur that weigh 150 pound and leave track bigger than they are , to inexplicable science which us laser to keep the dinosaur in check and poultry truck which have chicken loose in cage large enough for big dog ( I 've seen chicken truck they are all in cage the size of shoe box ) . And all that is in the first 15 minute of this disaster of a film . All the male actor are imbecile ( thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert , constantly dropping item to give the raptor an easy kill ) and the female actor all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick 's of Hollywood . The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins ( from the movie of the same name ) , it look like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the `` motion '' shot . If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style , this is gold . If you want competent film making and good acting ... do n't watch a Roger Corman film . Acting get a 4 out 10 , some of the player upon this stage did try . Story get a 2 out of 10 , it read like a drunken storytelling session gone bad . Special effect get a 2 out of 10 , I 've seen worse , but not many .",0

"In his first go a a Hollywood director , Henry Brommell whip an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issue with melancholic authenticity , and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father-son hit-man business . The film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast a well a a swift , family-conscious screenplay ( also by Brommell ) that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre . As a bonus , 'Panic ' delivers subtle , acerbic humoran unexpected , undeniably charming , and very welcome surprisethrough it bumbling , unsure-of-himself , low-key star , whose ever-cool state is enticing , especially given his line of work . The forever-great William H. Macy again capture our heart a Alex , a unhappy , torn , middle-aged husband and father who find solace in the most dubious of person : a young , attractive , equally-messed-up 23-year-old named Sarah ( Neve Campbell ) , whom he meet in the waiting-room at a psychologist 's office , where he awaits the therapy of Dr. Josh Parks ( John Ritter ) to discus his growing eagerness to quit the family business that his father ( Donald Sutherland ) built . Alex , whose lust to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father , strike an unwise fancy for Sarah , which ultimately lead him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and , more importantly to him , a good father to his six-year-old son , Sammy ( played enthusiastically by the endearing David Dorfman ) . Henry Brommell 's brilliant 'Panic ' is something of a rarity in Hollywood seldom seen ( with the exception of 2002 's 'Road to Perdition ' ) since it conception in 2000it weave two conflicting genre ( organized-crime , family drama ) into a fascinating , warm hunk of movie-viewing that is evenly strong in either directionand it 's one that will maintain it exceptional , infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for age to come .",1
"After perusing the large amount of comment on this movie it is clear that there are two kind of science fiction movie-goers . There are the one who are well read , extremely literate , and intelligent . They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what height it can reach in the hand of a gifted author . For many year science fiction languished in the basement of literature . Considered my most critic to be little more than story of ray gun and alien meant for pre-pubescent teenager . Today 's well read fan know well this history , and know the great author Asimov , Heinlein , Bradbury , and Ellison , who helped bring science fiction out of that basement . In doing so they created thought provoking , intelligent story that stretched the boundary and redefined the human condition . This well informed fan are critical of anything Hollywood throw at them . They are not critical for it 's own sake , but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye . ( As they should a Hollywood 's record ha been le than stellar . ) To these fan the story must take supreme importance . They can not be fooled by flashy computer graphic , and non stop action sequence . When the emperor ha no clothes they scream it the loudest . The second type of science fiction movie goer ha little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre . ( Look at many of the above comment that state `` Well I have n't read the book or anything by this author ... ) Their total exposure to science fiction is from movie or the Scifi channel . They are extremely uncritical , willing to overlook huge plot hole , weak premise , and thin story line if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effect . They are , in effect , willing to turn off their critical thinking skill ( or maybe they never had them ! ) for the duration of the movie . Case in point , I Robot . While supposedly based on Asimov 's short story and named after one of his novel , it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even le of what he tried to tell u about humanity and our robotic creation . ( Those of you that will run out and buy I , Robot will be very much surprised-this movie is n't even based on that story at all ! ) The film ha enormous plot hole , that at some point are stretched to the limit of credulity . I wo n't point them out . I wo n't spoon feed you . You need to practice you thinking skill and discover them for yourself . The character , which are named after many of Asimov 's character , do not posse the critical intelligence that wa a hallmark of his story . The plot itself with all it 's action sequence go against everything that the author stood for . His belief that humanity posse the capacity to solve problem using their mind , not their fist , is vital to understanding his vision of the future . In short , other than the name , their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie . There will always be those uncritical ( i.e . unthinking ) who will state : `` The movie doe n't have to be like the book . Due to the medium , movie sometimes require that change be made . '' But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book ( or book ) from the start ? What if all they took from the written work wa the title ? This begs the question : Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it 's title on your vacuous piece of crap ? Save money and do n't buy the right to the work . Title it something else . Do n't use the character 's name . Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism . In fact it wo n't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him . But it will upset those who read , who think , who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show . I , Robot , like much of Hollywood 's take on the genre , push Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in year ago . Hollywood could not do this alone . It take an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this .",0
"One of the few comedic Twilight Zones that 's actually really good . We have Floyd The Barber from Andy Griffith Show , The stock in trade Old Geezer dude from Many old western , and lovable old Frisby . It also ha that cool spacecraft interior that I believe wa used in the Sci Fi classic Forbidden Planet.Or else The Day The Earth Stood Sill.Plus the new guy in town are driving an exotic Renault ( I think ) sport car back in the day when European automobile were known a `` Foreign Jobs '' in the U.S .. The whole idea of harmonica a weapon is a hoot.And the fact that Frisby 's buddy love him despite being the fact he 's a total BS artist is a heartwarming moment .",1
"I wa expecting a very funny movie . Instead , I got a movie with a few funny joke , and many that just did n't work . I did n't like the idea of bringing in Sherlock Holmes ' and Moriarty 's descendant . It wa confusing . It would have been more funny if they just had someone new , instead of Moriarty resurrected . Some of the thing were funny . Burt Kwouk wa very funny , a always . McCloud on the horse wa funny . The McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 wa not even McGarrett-like . Connie Booth obviously is very good with accent . She is from Indiana , but played English and a New Yorker pretty well . Unfortunately , she wa not presented much into the script . I wa expecting a more funny film . Instead , I got a rather confusing movie with a poor script . Rather ironic , since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one . Maybe they were about to break up in 77 .",0
"This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel doe a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience . The many people who think they could fathom what go through a victim 's mind are arrogant . As a victim , I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in her role of Maya . I agree that this is an incredibly brave film . This look at rape from a different , more realistic standpoint than any other movie I 've ever seen on the subject . The end did drag on a bit long , but I know that many victim imagine this kind of justice , since the chance of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1 % . It 's good to see a movie that stick closer to reality than most would dare to .",1
"'What I Like About You ' is definitely a show that I could n't wait to see each day . Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show : 'The Amanda Show . ' She 's a very funny person and seems to be down to earth . `` Holly '' is such a like-able person and ha an `` out-there '' personality . I enjoyed how she always seemed to turn thing around and upside down , so she messed herself up at time . But that 's what made the show so great . I especially loved the show when the character 'Vince ' came along . Nick Zano is very HOT and funny , a well a 'Gary ' , Wesley Jonathan . The whole cast wa great , each character had their own personality and charm . Jennie Garth , Allison Munn , and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting . I especially loved 'Lauren ' ; she 's the best ! She helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she 's gon na do or say next ! Overall the show is really nice but the reason I did n't give it a 10 wa because there 's no more new episode and because the episode could 've been longer and more deep .",1
"I am not an artistically inclined individual . I am a science minded woman and I felt that this movie wa maybe one of those campy artsy type film on a budget . I watched part of it with my fiancé and my future step daughter . We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest . My fiancé and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to Ocean 's 13 , but that is another story . Not to be deterred I awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot . I began again watching this movie in earnest . I just do n't get it , I thought I would get it.I thought the funniest part wa the flushing of the ash and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used a a vase for what appeared to be dead flower . Interesting and still it had dead stuff inside . It wa an odd and bizarre movie . Maybe this is what they were after , however I wo n't be tricked a second time !",0

David continues his life a a free living and loving beachcomber with no one looking to kill him and about two million dollar richer . to David 's credit he had his friend Paco give Rosenski back his CD but under the condition that if anything happened to him his cousin , who Rosenlski doe n't know who and where he is , will shoot his big mouth off and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal dealing .",0
"The turning point in `` The Matador '' come about half through the movie when Danny , an unsophisticated man from Denver , is sitting in the balcony of his Mexico City hotel , enjoying a quiet moment . Someone knock on his door , and knowing it 's Julian , the paid assassin , he refuse to answer . But did he really ? Richard Shephard , the director of `` The Matador '' , present u with a character , Julian Noble , who show no redeemable quality . In fact , we have already seen him in action , doing what he doe best . When Julian meet Danny at the bar of the Camino Real in Mexico City , he spill the bean and tell his new acquaintance what he really doe for a living . Danny , who ha come to sell his program to a Mexican company , but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract . Danny is a naive person who fall prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter Julian . It 's not until some time later , on a cold winter night that the killer appears at Danny 's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson . It 's at this point that the secret that bind them together is revealed in an unexpected way . Pierce Brosnan , acting against type , make a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble . Just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boot give the right impression about his character . Greg Kinnear , on the other hand , play the straight part of this odd couple . Hope Davis appears only in a couple of scene leaving u to lament why did n't she stay longer . Philip Baker Hall put an appearance a the liaison between Julian and his assignment . Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material . The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the crisp cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything .",1
"Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov a Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire . Ustinov star a a convicted embezzler ( we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor 's tax return ) who , sensing that the future is in computer , pose ( by mean of a deft piece of identity theft ) a a computer expert and set out to infiltrate an American multinational . Ustinov ( who co-wrote the script ) is on top form , a is the delightful Maggie Smith , here unusually cast a an accident-prone cockney-sparrow dolly bird . Bob Newhart also put in an amusing performance a a suspicious executive who ha design on Maggie Smith . In addition , Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy a Ustinov and Newhart 's womanising bos . What do I particularly like about this film ? Not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie ' but it 's also a touching little love story ; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing a the two misfit stumbling into love ( the whole scene involving the deck of card is particularly effective . ) So , what is there not to like ? Well , the script is no more computer-literate than most film ( that is , hardly at all ) even though it capture the feel of late '60s 'big iron ' business computing quite well . Also there are a couple of small plot glitch that you 're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing , but I consider these to be minor niggles . As I said , this is a film which is well worth seeking out , and after you 've seen it once you 'll want to see it again at regular interval .",1
"Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch ... I highly recommend this movie . Her performance , in my opinion , wa Academy Award material ! The only real sad fact here is that Universal ha n't seen to it that this movie wa ever available on any video format , whether it be tape or DVD . They are ignoring a VERY good movie . But Universal ha little regard for it library on DVD , which is sad . If you get the chance to see this somewhere ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable ) , see it ! I wo n't go into the story because I think most people would rather have an opinion on the film , and too many `` reviewer '' spend hour writing about the story , which is available anywhere . a 10 !",1
"The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shelly 's `` I 'll Take You There '' is not overt , but clearly ha tie to his work ( Shelly ha acted in two of Hartley 's film ) . Not only doe her film exhibit a very tight narrative , but the hyper-stylized and extreme character strangely render human emotion in a very real light . Though this film is not ironic on the whole ( thank God ) , the small and subtle irony that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truth in love and loss . With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventy , `` I 'll See You There '' is a great indie-film that doe n't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woe of love and the reality of human emotion . The film begin with Bill 's life falling to piece . Not only ha he sold his best friend Ray a beautiful country home , but his wife Rose ha left him in order to join Ray in the retreat . All washed up , Bill wallow in his own gloom and doom until his sister Lucy ( played by the director Adrienne Shelly ) brings him all kind of surprise : a self-help book and a `` date '' for her traumatized brother . The unwilling Bill try to refuse , but the sudden appearance of Bernice at his door leaf him no choice . No doubt Bernice 's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to `` rebound '' with her . However , her pseudo-hippie quality annoy him so much that he lash at her on their first date . And Bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remark that she attache herself to him , forcing herself upon him . To what end , we are not aware ... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho . ( And who better to play the psycho than Ally Sheedy ? ) Aware that Bill desperately want to see Rose , Bernice offer her car , but on the condition that he take her somewhere first . On the way , she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun ( a Pinkerton Detective , no le ) . An imbroglio of angst , resentment , redemption , passion and violence ensue a Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose ... of course , with a few stop along the way .",1
"When in 1982 , `` The Thing '' came out to theater everywhere , it had a cold reception and very poor box-office result , becoming almost a failure in John Carpenter 's career a a horror director ; however , time ha proved that `` The Thing '' wa definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial result were not the film 's fault . Nowadays , John Carpenter 's `` The Thing '' ha gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fan a a horror classic , and not without a reason , a this new version of John W. Campbell , Jr. 's story `` Who Goes There ? '' ( previously adapted a `` The Thing From Another World '' ) is closer to the original tale and keep a pessimistic feeling of dread and high dos of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia . The plot of `` The Thing '' , begin in the winter of 1982 in a U.S. research station located in the remote territory of Antarctica , when the member of the crew notice a Norwegian helicopter coming their way . The two apparently insane pilot of the helicopter are trying to kill a Husky dog who make it way into the American base . After the Norwegians are killed accidentally , the Americans try to figure out what made them to be insane . Soon they 'll discover that the Husky dog the Norwegians were hunting wa not a normal dog , but a creature able to mimic every living creature , and not only that , it ha a tremendous hunger . Director John Carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher `` Halloween '' , where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock . `` The Thing '' could be seen a an evolution of that style , a even when Carpenter make great use of Rob Bottin 's special effect ( which were labeled by critic a `` repulsive '' on it day ) , the film still focus more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent ( and very well-done ) display of gore . The feeling of loneliness , a well a the `` bad karma '' between the member of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia a anyone could be the Thing , even our main character , R. J. MacReady ( Kurt Russell ) , ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted . This plot element wa more faithful to the concept of the source novel , and wa blatantly ignored by the previous version ( not completely a bad thing , just a big difference ) , making this version feel le like a remake and more a a new conception of the source novel . Bill Lancaster 's script handle the character with brilliant domain , giving u enough to distinguish them , but not too much to completely trust them , making them an essential factor in the film 's haunting feeling of dread that keep running through the movie . The mystery and the suspense are at the max , a never one can tell who is the Thing and who is normal , enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent result . The cast is very effective , and their performance a a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feeling between their character a real . Carpenter 's regular collaborator Kurt Russell a MacReady carry the film , and through his eye we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes a the situation go worse . Definitely one of his best performance . Wilford Brimley is also terrific a Dr. Blair , a scientist that go insane after discovering the Thing 's purpose . `` The Thing '' is a film so wonderfully crafted that it flaw tend to go unnoticed , although they exist . The most notorious being the very low-key and at time unappropriated score by Ennio Morricone . It 's not exactly bad , but it just feel out of place at some scene and it 's not one of the best work by the legendary composer . Also , due to some misshapes with the special effect , some scene were left out that actually fill some small plot hole , although nothing of big importance or actually annoying . When talking about John Carpenter 's film , most people will almost instantly name `` Halloween '' a his favorite film , but personally , I would go with `` The Thing '' , a I consider it Carpenter 's greatest achievement so far , and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror film ever made . I would go a far a to call it one of the finest film ever made . 10/10",1
"Here 's one you can watch with a straight face , with a script so bad , even Will Ferrell would n't be in it . There are two laugh in HOT ROD . 1 . The Punch-Dance . Rod `` need to go to his quiet place '' and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon , he is footloosing a passionate , overwrought bodyswerve to the strain of a band who wish they had the big-hair faux-metal chop of Europe . 2 . John Farnham 's You 're The Voice . In one of those epic sequence where the star and his cohort do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townfolk follow on their heel in support , the soundtrack is the gag . How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist ? A major Australian vocalist ( and a genuine talent ) who shot to fame in the early '70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin ' On My Head , then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You 're The Voice , John Farnham 's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy , it leveled mountain in Switzerland . Besides these two high point in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else 's vomit . Andy Samberg is Rod , a failed stunt jumper who ha never made a jump . Maybe it 's got something to do with the fact he 's driving a moped into the heart of darkness . Or his fake mustache . Yeh , someone actually thought that wa funny . Without one jump under his starry belt , he plan for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian , like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever ... who watch these movie for plot anyway ? Along the way ( a usual for moronic lead in these comedy ) , he score a salubrious chick ( Isla Fisher ) , who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosome with this loser . Sissy Spacek ( CARRIE , 1976 ) ha so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up . Ian McShane must 've lost a bet to be here .",0
"If you liked Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , the chance are you 'll like this , too . Although I guess a few of the British in-joke ( like calling two London character Dixon and Winterburn , after Arsenal soccer player ) may be lost on some , this is still cracking entertainment , which veritably pump with vitality . Carlyle , Miller and Tyler are all excellent , bringing depth to their character , and the interplay between the two protagonist is always well-judged . In fact Scott 's direction is very assured , considering that this is his first feature film , and prof that he ha his father 's talent for putting u at ease in unfamiliar surroundings .

"do n't expect much from this film . In many way this film resembles a film that Doris Day starred in in 1956 , title , Julie . In this film Doris , who wa a flight attendant , stewardess , in those day , landed the air craft after her derange husband , played by Louis Jordan shot the captain . She did a far better job , more convincing , than Kim Ojah , who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower . I know a little about 747 aircraft , i use to be a flight attendant myself . Like i said , do not expect much from this film , it wa done on a cheap budget . The producer were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it . Oceanic is one name that several movie have used . The only writing on this plane wa the name of the company that made the aircraft .",0
"PROM NIGHT ( 2008 ) directed by : Nelson McCormick starring : Brittany Snow , Scott Porter , Jessica Stroup , and Dana Davis plot : Three year ago , Donna ( Brittany Snow ) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hand of her teacher ( Jonathan Schaech ) who ha a bit of a crush on her . Now , she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friend . Once there , they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt . pro : I got a few good laugh out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character move . An example : Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her ( she doe n't seem that great ) ha escaped from prison . Their reason : They do n't want to embarrass her in front of all her friend . LOL con : Let me start off by saying I 'm a huge slasher fan . Usually I can have fun with even the bad one . I even like some PG-13 horror film . TOURIST TRAP ( 1979 ) , one of my favorite , wa originally rated PG . I also enjoy POLTERGEIST ( 1982 ) and THE GRUDGE ( 2004 ) . So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 doe not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie . First of all , I had a big problem with the story . I like slasher film that do n't even have story . At least they can be entertaining . This is about a teacher who fall in love with his student , so he kill her entire family . A few year later , he try to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friend ... ? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about . Claire ( Jessica Stroup ) is fighting with her boyfriend , she ha cramp , and I could n't care le . This should have been a Lifetime feature , not a remake of PROM NIGHT . And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scene . I do n't even care that it 's not that gory , some of my favorite slasher ( HALLOWEEN , CURTAINS , the original PROM NIGHT ) were not that gory but they still had effective murder . Here , we have half the character dying in the same hotel room off screen , a woman being stabbed several time with no stab wound , and a closeup on a bad actor 's face a he scream in agony . I 'm sure that 10 year-old girl were terrified , but not me . I also hated the character . There wa Donna 's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby ( Scott Porter ) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life , unless you are a gay male . Then we had Donna 's annoying friend Claire ( Stroup ) and Lisa ( Dana Davis ) , and the token mean girl Chrissy ( Brianne Davis ) . If you thought the character in DEATH PROOF were annoying , try watching this movie . And do n't get me started on Ronnie ( Collins Pennie ) and the DJ ( Jay Phillips ) who gave me flashback to Usher 's performance in SHE 'S ALL THAT . Add to all that predictable plot turn , a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material , and you have quite a stinker .",0

Ayone who whine about how this movie wa crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for `` Jean de Florrette '' . HELLO ! this film wa made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form . I would also like to remind these whiner that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point . This film is clearly made for people who do n't appreciate the so called `` american humour '' which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap . The point is everyone ha an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some people sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off . Thankyou,1
"Sex , Drugs , Rock & Roll is without a doubt the worst product of Western Civilization .

"36 . THE HOSPITAL ( comedy , 1971 ) A series of emergency ha gripped Manhattan Hospital . Patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded condition , and a ineptitude staff . When a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner , Dr. Bock ( George C. Scott ) , is called in to investigate . Having worked a a doctor for too many year , and going through a mid-life crisis of his own , Dr. Bock find the going tough . He decides to commit suicide . But then he meet Barbara ( Diana Rigg ) , a young-hippie beauty . Whose keen insight on life help the depressed Bock . Critique : Black comedy feature a 'tour-de-force ' performance from veteran actor George C. Scott . He 's good at playing high-strung , serious character whose strict moral are severely tested . First half of the film unfolds like a melodrama , giving a pretty good account of hospital life , and the shamble they sometimes are . But then , a thing look set for a dramatic climax it skews into slapstick comedy . If Paddy Chayefsky 's script had maintained it dramatic feel I wonder if Scott would 've walked out with another best Actor Oscar ( he had previously won it , 'in-absentia ' , the year before ) . His breakdown ( suicide ) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history . QUOTE : Dr. Bock : `` . . .last night I sat in my hotel room reviewing the shamble of my life and contemplating suicide . I said 'no Bock do n't do it . You 're a doctor , a healer , you 're a necessary person , you 're life is meaningful ' .

"Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movie . Lots of action , lot of great dialogue ( e.g . fun to quote ) , a little intrigue , and stuff blowing up all over the place . Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry . Violent , but not gory . The fact that the female part wa the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about . Have seen the movie more than a dozen time and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite film rotation every 3 or 4 month . I initially rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson wa in the film , but wa caught up in the event surrounding Samantha 's quest to regain her memory and have never looked back .

The only thing that carry the movie is the music . Of course you did n't bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performance of the Tackacs quartet , but OK I have to admit that the performance at least have quality a contrast to the movie you 've made . It start of with the dying DEAF Beethoven who perfectly understands Anna who is merely whispering . Beethoven 's hearing during the movie get 's better by the minute , but that must be because of some vague divine thing . Then there is the quite impossible semi-pornographic `` eye wide shut '' double-conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious Anna and the cry nephew in the end ( who also cry in the deleted scene with constant red eye , my GOD what a performance ) . And a culmination the rip-off from Amadeus , with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in note but in total nonsense , which she understands perfectly but no-one else in your audience even trained professional musician will understand . Of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least , but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason . This so called homage is blasphemy and I am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movie ever made even though it 's about my favorite subject . Ed Harris and others , you can not comprehend the greatness of Beethoven in your wildest dream and certainly not after a couple of lesson in conducting and violin playing . That 's the trouble with you Americans : you think you can grasp everything even when it take a lifetime of hard work . Yeah we can do it anyway ! Remember that a good product come with hard labor , talent , devotion and professionalism . All these you creator of Copying Beethoven lack . See you in kindergarten .",0
"Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America 's great director . I 'm not sure he qualifies a one of Hollywood 's great craftsman . But he certainly rank up there with the best of Hollywood 's true professional who were willing to march to their own music . During the time he worked for Hollywood studio , he knew how to take an assignment , shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than it part ... on time and on budget . Pickup on South Street is a case in point . On the surface it 's one more of Hollywood 's early Fifties ' anti-Commie movie , complete with appeal to patriotism , a hard-boiled hero and a slimy ( and copiously perspiring ) bad guy . Fuller turn this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut , exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twist . The hero , Skip McCoy , is a three-time loser , a petty crook with soft finger who doe n't change his stripe until the very end . The girl in the caper , Candy , ha a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you 're so inclined . One of the most appealing character , Moe Williams , is a stoolie . And in an unusual approach to Hollywood 's battle against Commies , the appeal to patriotism fall on deaf ear ; the hero is n't motivated by anything so ennobling . He just want payback for a personal reason , and wind up becoming ... at least for now ... a good guy . Plus , all the actor were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio . He had to make do . Richard Widmark by now had established his presence a an actor and star , but Jean Peters is a surprise . She give a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb , and no better than her boy friend ... or her client ... want her to be . And Richard Kiley , who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway , is convincingly slippery and cowardly . It 's hard to remember that he wa the actor who inflicted on u , I mean introduced to u , `` The Impossible Dream '' from Man of La Mancha , More than anything else , this tale of a pickpocket who pick a purse in a subway car and find himself with microfilmed secret instead of cash , pursued by the Feds and the Commies , move straight ahead with great economy . The whole enterprise , with a classic noir look , only take 80 minute to tell . The dialogue , with Fuller a screenwriter , ha that party corny , partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style . `` That muffin you grifted ... she 's okay , '' one character say to Skip about Candy . Fuller move u just fast enough from scene to scene to keep u hanging on what will come next . Then Fuller throw in the character of Moe Williams . All of a sudden the story ratchet up to a whole new level of interest , part comedy relief and part sad inevitability . The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller 's talent and strength . In 2 minute and 15 second , starting right after the credit , Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie , to establish for u what the story is about , and to show u what kind of character -- Skip and Candy -- we 're going to be involved with . And he doe this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot , packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch u . Says Glenn Erickson , in my opinion one of the best of movie critic , `` In what should be an inconsequential story , Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up : stiff-necked , aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what 's wrong and what 's right and is n't afraid to fight for it . As always in his work , the individual who fight the hardest for their country are the one least likely to benefit from the effort . '' He 's right , and it make for a movie still vivid after 55 year .",1

First , I 'm convinced that our kid are not stupid , they are just kid , but they know ( my 1 and a half year old son `` selects '' what to see ) what 's nice or disgusting . Did you see the news ? Do you think your kid HAVE TO KNOW the reality a it is ? Maybe .. or maybe not ; we ( the adult ) have the responsibility about what we want for our kid , and what to teach them . A film of drug dealer ? news about massacre in Middle East ? Of course , the kid must know there is a Real Life , but ... they are kid ; let 's give them some mercy . What do you want for them ?

"Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie ' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friend thinking it wa going to be a budget version of `` Land of the Dead '' . Boy , wa I wrong . It seems a if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art , which is very misleading to fan of the zombie genre . We watched up to the point where the zombie chick come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell-phone . They actually speak to the guy before one of the girl kill him ; but once they started driving the car , I could n't suspend my disbelief anymore . Some people actually consider this a `` so bad , it 's good '' movie , they are liar . I did n't finish the movie , but one of the other review mention that they actually somehow become police officer at the end of the movie , which make me glad to not have watched it all the way through . This is even worse than `` Zombiez '' DO NOT WATCH !",0
"I often feel like Scrooge , slamming movie that others are raving about - or , I write the review to balance unwarranted raf . I found this movie almost unwatchable , and , unusual for me , wa fast-forwarding not only through dull , clichéd dialog but even dull , clichéd musical number . Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical , lot of fantasy , some animation -- is more than offset by a script that ha not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development . Individually , June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people , but ca n't carry a movie a a team . Neither is really charismatic or ha much sex appeal . They 're both bland . I like Billy Gray , but his character is pretty one-note . The best part of the film , to me , are June Haver 's beautiful costume and great body .",0
"Recap : Full moon . A creature , a huge werewolf , is on the hunt . Not for flesh , not for blood ( not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though ) , but for a mate . He is on the hunt for a girl . Not any girl though . The Girl . The girl that is pure ( and also a werewolf , although she doe n't know it yet ) . Three , well check that , two cop ( after the first scene ) and an old bag lady is all that can stop it , or even know that the thing killing and eating a lot of folk around full moon is a werewolf . This particular powerful werewolf , Darkwolf , is closing in on the girl . If he get her , mankind is doomed . Now the cop ha to find the girl , convince her not only that there is someone , a werewolf nonetheless , that want to rape her , and perhaps kill her , but that she is a werewolf herself . And then they got to stop him ... Comments : This is one for the boy , the teenage boy . A lot of scene with semi-nude girl more or le important for the plot . Mostly le . Well I guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is ( expectedly ) thin . And unfortunately there is little besides the girl to help the plot from breaking . One usually turn to two main theme . Nudity . Check . And then special effect . Hmm ... Well there are some thing that you might call effect . They 're not very special though . In fact , to be blunt , they are very bad . The movie seems to be suffering of a lack of fund . They could n't afford clothes for some of the girl ; ) , and the effect are cheap . Some of the transformation between werewolf and human form , obviously done by computer , are really bad . You might overlook such thing . But the Darkwolf in itself is very crude too , and you never get to see any killing . Just some mutilated corps afterwards . And there is surprisingly little blood about , in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood . I 'm not sure what to say about actor and character . Most of the time they do well , but unfortunately there are lapse were the character ( or actor ) just loos it . A few of these lapse could be connected with the problem mentioned above . Like the poor effect , or the poor budget ( ? ) . That could explain why there is precious little shooting , even if the character are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight ( and not moving ) . But hey , when you 're in real danger , there nothing that will save your life like a good one-liner ... Unfortunately that ca n't explain moment when the Cop , Steve , the only one who know how to maybe deal with the problem , the werewolf that is , run away , when the only thing he can be sure of , is that the werewolf is coming for the girl , who is just beside him now , and that he can not let it have her . But sure , it let the maker stretch the ending a little more ... But I would n't mind seeing none of the lead actors/actresses get another try in another movie . Well . To give a small conclusion : Not a movie that I recommend . 3/10",0
"I first heard about The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube . He literally slapped the show with a big bad rant , condemning it rubbish and confusing . Curious , I decided to watch the show ( once I got the order of the episode right , thanks to those who made the list ) , and I found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch . Great memorable character who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and hilarious ; a unique and not over blowing plot that make sense now that I 've watched the show ; and two of the best anime moment in history , in my opinion . Plus the opening and ending theme are great . The anime , based on a collection of successful manga novel , follows a simple plot , once you understand it . While the show 's focus is on the main character , Haruhi Suzumiya , the point of view is from her friend Kyon . Kyon is a regular high school student who doe n't really believe in supernatural stuff ( e.g . Santa Clause , alien , time traveller , ghost , espers ) but he soon end up talking to Haruhi , who is the most oddest girl in the school and would prefer to date an alien , considering all men worthless . She even joined every club in the school to find something interesting , but quit a quickly a she joined . Upon `` advice '' from Kyon , Haruhi decides to form her own club with Kyon 's club . Setting up in the literary club room , Haruhi form the SOS Brigade - it mission to investigate supernatural case ( think Scooby-Doo minus the dog , the masked man and the Mystery Machine ) . Haruhi `` recruit '' three extra member . The first is Yuki Nagato , a bookworm of sort who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting . The second is Mikuru Asahina , a shy girl who is forced into the club by Haruhi who think they need a cute mascot to get some thing done . She is often forced into costume by Haruhi to further her cuteness . The third is Itsuki Koizumi , a friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling . While Haruhi think her group is filled with normal people she could n't be more wrong . While Kyon is a normal a you can get , the other three on the other hand are rather unique - Yuki is an alien , Mikuru is a time traveller from the future , and Itsuki is an esper ( a person who ha ESP ) . All three have come to watch over Haruhi who may just have the power of a god , and if she becomes bored , she may be able to discover her power and create a whole new world , and Kyon is involved somehow . The show is worth watching with great character , music and some hilarious and wonderful moment . However , for parent , there is some sexual reference including Mikuru 's cleavage being exposed or touched several time , and several swear word used a well . Apart from that , the show is one of the great .",1
"Well I 've enjoy this movie , even though sometimes it turn too much to a stereotypical situation . I didnt understood at this time if the `` Punishment Park '' ha exist in the past , but I think the matter isnt really here . You have to look at this movie in a different manner . It show how much violence you can find in our world . It reminds u that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it . If anyone refuse to `` take his responsabilities '' then you will be thrown out of our society ... All our history is made by war , we should never forget this . In fact it only when we will finally accept the truth that , maybe , we will change and understand that our `` intellectual skill '' have improve . So we could use them to find others way to resolve our problem . In 2 word this movie is a must see , maybe it will help u to accept the truth ...",1
"When I first read Armistead Maupins story I wa taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he care about and love . That being said , we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood ... Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded ! With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams capture the fragile essence of Gabriel and let u see his struggle with issue of trust both in his personnel life ( Jess ) and the world around him ( Donna ) . As we are introduced to the player in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever a it seems and that the smallest event can change our life irrevocably . The request to review a book written by a young man turn into a life changing event that help Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward . It 's to bad that most people will avoid this film . I only say that because the average American will probably think `` Robin Williams in a serious role ? That did n't work before ! '' PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE ! Robin Williams touch the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people . Like his movie One Hour Photo he ha stepped up a an actor and made another quality piece of art . Oh and before I forget , I believe Bobby Cannavale a Jess steal every scene he is in . He ha the 1940 's leading man look and screen presence . It 's this hack opinion he could carry his own movie right now ! ! S~",1
"I waited until the 4th of July to write this because . . . well . . . because it just feel right to be doing it on this day . In 1924 D.W. Griffith needed a hit , he had not had a big one since ORPHANS OF THE STORM ( 1921 ) . He 'd been working steadily since then but his movie had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audience . He wa planning a film about Patrick Henry when he wa contacted by member of the Daughters of the American Revolution ( DAR ) who asked if he might expand his idea to encompass more of the American Revolution . This movie is the result . By the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wa n't a trace of Patrick Henry anywhere . We all know the story of the Revolutionary War but Griffith threw in a love story with Patriot farmer Nathan ( Neil Hamilton ) falling in love with Tory aristocrat Nancy Montague ( Carol Dempster , a leading lady for Griffith for many year ) . Complicating matter is the fact that Nancy 's father hate Nathan . . . well not just Nathan , he hate all rebel . It doe not help matter when , during a skirmish on the street of Lexington someone jostle Nathan 's arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound Nancy 's dad ! Paralelling the love story is the ( mostly true but partially embellished ) story of Capt . Walter Butler ( Lionel Barrymore ) a renegade British officer who feel he owes allegiance to no one . With Thousands of Indians form the Six Nations on his side he hope to crush the colonial and become monarch of his own empire . Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION ( 1915 ) are inevitable . The Montague family might just a well be the Cameron 's from the earlier film while Nathan could be a part of the Stoneman family . The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is staged very similarly to a scene in BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army , in this case the Redcoats , storming a trench packed with Patriots . The only thing missing is Henry Walthall charging across No Man 's Land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon . Amazingly enough the battle scene in America seem to lack the energy of the battle scene in BIRTH and fail to draw the audience in . Something is clearly missing . It is n't scope , G.W . `` Billy '' Bitzer 's camera work is quite good . Maybe what is missing is . . . dare I say it . . . sincerity ? The brutality of Capt . Butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen . Do n't expect any head to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in INTOLERANCE ( 1916 ) . In one scene Butler 's second in command , Capt . Hare ( Louis Wolhiem ) gouge out the eye of a captive colonist . We see only the beginning of the deed , for the remainder the camera focus on Hare 's face a he obviously ha a good time doing this . Lionel had been working with Griffith on and off since 1912 . A story go that he approached Griffith for work and D.W. , knowing the reputation of his famous family , said `` I am not hiring stage actor . '' to which Lionel replied `` And I am nothing of the kind , sir ! '' He make a very good and quite believable villain . Louis Wolhiem appeared with Lionel 's older brother John three time ; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE ( both 1920 ) and later in THE TEMPEST ( 1927 ) . As Capt . Hare his wild staring eye and disheveled hair not only mark him a a villain but make you think he is quite mad also . Neil Hamilton later remarked that America wa his first time on horseback and `` I wa scared to death. '' . He hide his displeasure very well though and we can believe he wa quite the equestrian by the time shooting wa over . Mr. Griffith wa very much in love with Carol Dempster and at one point asked her to marry him . She refused and soon left his stock company , after which her star status gradually waned . Speaking of horse , one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of Paul Revere 's ride . He ride his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce `` To arm ! The Regulars are coming ! '' but a he try to leave the horse can not negotiate the step backwards and stumble spilling his rider on the ground ! I am amazed Griffith did not do another take . So is America a classic ? YES ! Do n't wait for July 4th to see it , it is enjoyable anytime .",1
"This is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that poke fun at everything French and then produce a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe . Portrayed by the splendid Gerard Philippe , the dashing young man belief utterly in the fate curvaceous Lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry King Louis XV 's daughter ! Problem is , La Lollo soon find out she too is in love with Fanfan ... Propelled by good sword fight , cavalcade , and other spirited action sequence the film move at a brisk pace and with many comic moment . The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and take itself so un-seriously that I could not give those shortcoming a second thought . Look out for Noel Roquevert , a traditional heavy in French film , trying to steal La Lollo , making himself a nuisance , and feeding the script to the fortune teller that read La Lollo 's hand ! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is a the megalomanous and lust-driven King Louis XV ! That is not all : So many beautiful woman in one film make me wish I were in France and on the set back in 1952 ! The film may have come out that year but it verve , cheek , superb narration , immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch . I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchild let alone to anyone who love movie in general and swashbuckler in particular ! Do see it !",1

"Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable ? I think not . Basically the movie is cliché after cliché and really nothing ever come a a surprise . It make the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension . So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also a a drama it 's a failure . This is because the movie it story is highly unlikely . I mean , no way this could ever happen in real life , a in the same way a the event occur in this movie . So the movie ha a real suspense and credibility problem . But it truly are the clichés that killed the movie . It wa cringing stuff at time . Everything is so formulaic in this movie . The predator is portrayed a a cool heartless , almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim a a naive young woman , who act like she did n't see any of this coming . Everything that happened in the movie wa so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason . Such a the sequence in which the 'predator ' fix the 'victims ' broken car . That ha got to be one of the oldest clichés out of the book . I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point . I tried to look a if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eye of the other person around them . It wa so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point . The movie is filled with moment like these . The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie . Which mean that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve it time on character development and unnecessary sub-plots to make the movie even more drama like . I 'll admit that Elizabeth Berkley is pretty good acting in this movie . She make some of the clichés and event look even almost realistic at time . Her Hollywood career is a good a over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie `` Showgirls '' , so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one . It 's a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better . All of the other character are a disappointment . Corey Sevier play the cliché pretty 'untouchable ' rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse . He look more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie . He basically try to have sex with his wife in every sequence . He wake up , he want sex . Before he go to sleep , he want sex . He get home , he want sex . It might be a realistic thing but I do n't know , it just did n't feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general . A cliché filled movie and I ca n't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie . It 's predictable and therefor also lack in suspense and credibility . Not an 'horrible ' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at time but all the weak and cliché element in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one . 4/10",0
"I wa shocked and surprised by the negative review I saw on the web , I thought Cinderella 2 ( a well a 3 ) is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone - kid and adult ... like me , I am 22 year old .

I thought it ha great animation , and the voice casting wa very good ; the song performed by Brooke Allison too .

Ms Bates play Grace Beasley.The film take you from her doledrums married life in Chicago to England , the home of her recently murdered singing idol Victor Fox.There she meet his three surviving uppity sisters.She also discovers that Victor leaf behind a male lover , Dirk Simpson .

Everyone in the picture did a fine job.Particularly enjoyed Julie Andrews , Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow.This movie wa fun.It make you cry.The music is absolutely charming .

"Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named Zoey who transfer into an all boy boarding school during the first year that they integrate girl into it . That raw plot line is , I 'll admit , a pretty good idea . Although this show wa meant for child , a five year old could probably point out it fatal flaw . First , Zoey is a cliché character , her being super popular , super attractive , super smart , and there ; s nothing wrong with her ; no girl is like that . It feel like the show wa put the spotlight on Jamie Lynn Spears and increase her fame . Dana , who appeared at the beginning of the first season , is just plain mean . However , in my opinion , she wa probably the most realistic character of them all , which is sad seeing that Dana is never nice . Nicole is too peppy and act like a complete airhead , but mysteriously get straight A 's . Lola seems to be able to fool anything with her Emmy-deserving acting skill . Quinn is supposed to be super smart , and although she is able to create the most unrealistic thing , she is also made out to be weird , and she never get any guy although she is both beautiful and smart , while Zoey , Lola , and Nicole get guy and they 're all beauty and no personality . Chase and Michael are very similar , and I even sometimes get them confused . Logan is unrealistically rich , and hand out million like they 're dollar . Nobody 's that rich . I 've also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that Stacy girl , who doe nothing but act nice to them . That 's not funny ! That 's mean and it just influence young girl to act mean to totally nice people . Finally , the school itself add the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the student with 5-star amenity such a a scenic location , sushi bar , hot lounge equipped with free soda machine , pool & jacuzzi , movie theater , and the allowance for boy and girl to freely go into the other sex 's dorm room . At most boarding school , if a boy were to go into a girl 's dorm or vice versa they would be expelled . In conclusion , Zoey 101 wa poorly written and should have spent a few more year in the drafting process .",0
"This movie is terrible , it wa so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity Chinese people , the movie did n't show any convincing argument to prove that . And the rest of the plot did n't make any effort to show u more than a cheap common sense ... The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be . Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother , the most annoying character I have seen for a long time . The acting and scenery were OK , but the plot ruin everything , full of cheap clichés and hypocritical scene , I expect not to see this movie again in my life . Skip this one !",0
The only thing serious about this movie is the humor . Well worth the rental price . I 'll bet you watch it twice . It 's obvious that Sutherland enjoyed his role .,1
"2005 wa one of the best year for movie . We had so many wonderful movie , like Batman Begins , Sin City , Corpse Bride , A History of Violence ..... Coming up we also got Brokeback Mountain , King Kong .... But if this year the only great movie that came out wa Everything Is Illuminated , then we would n't miss all this year ha brought . The first movie a a director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful , heart-warming , touching drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood 's best role . He is perfect a Jonathan , a curious man that head for Ukraine to find the woman who saved his Grandfather in World War II . Liev Schreiber , who also writes the movie , conduct a masterpiece , with memorable scene and ( a lot of ) funny quote . This here is a genuine mixture of Comedy with Drama , bringing a movie that will be commented year from now . A serious Oscar contender , Everything is Illuminated is a powerful , original , and , why not say , illuminated movie . But there 's one thing you should remember while entering the movie : leave normal behind . This is special. -- -- -- 9/10",1
"According to John Ford 's lyrically shot , fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln 's life his greatest fault may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in `` the worst way . '' Ford 's camera ha only praising view to reveal of Mr. Lincoln 's early life . But for what the film lack in character complexity it make up for in beauty and depth of vision . Uncharacteristically beautiful composition of early film , what could have been a series of gorgeous still frame , Ford ha a unique eye for telling a story . The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man . Henry Fonda play the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln to a tee , one of his best role . The film concern two young men , brother , on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed . In classic angry mob style , the town decides to take justice into their own hand and lynch the pair of them , until honest Abe step into the fray . He charm them with his humor , telling them not to rob him of his first big case , and that they are a good a lynched with him a the boy lawyer . What follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder-dramas thereafter , a Abe cunningly interrogates witness to the delight and humor of the judge , jury and town before he stumble upon the missing link . The film play out like many John Ford movie do : a tablespoon of Americana , a dash of moderate predictability , a hint of sarcasm that you are n't sure if you put in the recipe or if Ford did it himself . Despite the overtly 'Hollywood ' feel of the film , and overly patriotic banter alluding to Lincoln 's future presidency , the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed , if you can take your drama with a grain of salt .",1
"Where to start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy , I would say it wa FANNN-TASTIC ! Unfortunately for me , and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare ( mind you that wa the price I paid , got it from Wal-Mart ) , this movie wa meant to be a thriller . The only THRILL I got wa watching Kirkland 's lousy rendition of Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy woodland area . If you want a good laugh , on a rainy Friday night with some friend , then I highly recommend this movie . But if you want to watch something at least half way decent , then do n't even bother . I for one enjoy crappy film , the worse the better in most case . But Wow ... I Meant WOW ! ! The only person in the entire film that did n't stink it up wa the little boy , played by Vincent Berry . The only reason why I even give it 3 star is because it gave me something to do .",0
"Oh dear god . This wa horrible . There is bad , then there wa this . This movie make no sense at all . It run all over the map and is n't clear about what it saying at all . The music seemed like it wa trying to be like Batman . The fact that 'Edison ' is n't a real city , take away . Since I live in Vancouver , watching this movie and recognizing all these place made it unbearable . Why did n't they make it a real city ? The only writing that wa decent was'Tilman ' in which John Heard did a fantastic job . He wa the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy . It wa actually a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time , and the movie be a washout . Too bad . Hopefully someone important will see it , and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due , and hire him a lead bad guy again , which is where he should be . on the A List .",0
"Yes , bad acting is n't only one thing to mention . Bad script , not so bad music . Unfortunately . Nice girl and nice boy with perfect body and super teeth just is n't enough for me and for you too . First thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea , to have some fun ! ! ! Smiling ... They find everything in the sea . I mean thing like fishing-net , knife , scuba dive thing , rope , bottle , husband ... Woodoo stuff , are you kidding . Stupid . They are so happy on the island , they are going to die , and they are happy . Love , peace . Love . Just stupid . Terrible , skip this one please .",0
"I do n't think that many film ( especially comedy ) have added memorable , quotable dialog like MOONSTRUCK . I wo n't illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quote on this thread - but any film that can make subject like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purpose into memorable dialog is amazing to me . It is not the only line that pop up and make an imprint on our memory . How about a restaurant waiter who regret a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client ? Or a nice , elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon ? Or Perry ( John Mahoney 's ) description of a female student 's youthful promise a `` moonlight in a martini '' ( my favorite line ) . MOONSTRUCK is a wonderful example of brilliant script , first rate direction , and a good ensemble cast that fit perfectly . There are other example ( the drama THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is another example , but a grimmer one ) . Cher , Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia , Nicholas Cage , John Mahoney , and Danny Aiello are all involved in plot and cross purpose that examine the nature of love , and how to handle it . Is it a good thing to be totally in love ? Cher and Cage , at the end , seem to think so , but Dukakis know that real love drive the individual crazy ( and Cage get a glimmer of realization of this too , when he and Cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera La Boheme ) . Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thought of death . Dukakis belief so , and ( oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced ) Aiello . Chance reveals infidelity - Dukakis realizes early that Gardenia 's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness , and Cher literally stumble onto Gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera ( but Gardenia also stumble onto Cher 's similar unfaithfulness to Aiello ) . But chance also cause misunderstanding : Fyodor Chaliapin stumble on Dukakis walking with John Mahoney and think that she is having an affair . There are lovely little moment in the film too . Cher 's observation about flower leading to receiving one . Her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it 's resolution . But best is the sequence of Louis Guss and Julie Bovasso a Cher 's uncle and aunt Raymond and Rita Cappomaggi and Rita 's charming and kind comment to Raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him . It is the sweetest moment of the entire film . It is close to a flawless film . After seeing it over a dozen time in a many year I can only find two point that do not seem a smooth a they should be . When Cher is at Cage 's bakery , his assistant Chrissy ( Nada Despotovich ) mention how she is secretly in love with Cage , but ha been afraid to tell him . Earlier she wa slightly snippy towards Cher , who put her in her place quickly . Yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry . At the same time , the fact that Cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt 's daily business profit is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minute of the film - but just a quickly dropped . Was there supposed to be some plot line that were dropped , besides one about Cher and Vincent Gardenia working at a homeless man 's shelter a penance ? It is a small annoyance , but I think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good .",1
"One ha to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a script existed that made any sense . Was the rough cut 3 hour long and wa it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives ? Why would anyone finance this mess ? I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he doe what he can with the dialogue and dramatic ( ? ) situation he is given . But character come and go for no apparent reason , continuity is non-existent , and the acting , cinematography , and direction are ( to put it politely ) amateurish . Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate choice of title a it will probably prove untrue should anyone actually attempt to actually watch this film .",0
"This time around , Blackadder is no longer royal ( or even particularly close to being any such thing ) ... instead , rather a butler to the Prince Regent , portrayed by Hugh Laurie ( who replaces Tim McInnerny , who presence is sorely missed , and that hole is never filled ... his character had an innocent charm ... while he wa a bumbling and complete moron , we ca n't help but care for him , which is n't at all true of his replacement ) a being intolerably daft ( which he apparently wa , according to the Trivia page ) , not to mention loud-mouthed and utterly non-threatening . Edmund can now do just about what he plea , and doe so . Why is he so frustrated and angry ( honestly , it get depressing at time ) ? Yes , his master is a buffoon , they always are . He doe n't seem to lack money , nor is he in any danger . In the second series , the Queen wa mischievous and childish , and would cut off someone 's head - or marry them - on a whim . Here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting . There is still commentary and even a little satire . Too often , it seems a if they thought that the history wa funny enough on it own , so they merely restate it , not bothering to actually turn the fact into joke or gag . And I ca n't tell you how many of them I figured out before they were done , literally more than a minute away . It 's not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered . Baldrick doe n't change from last season ... he 's still rather pathetic and stupid , leading to `` silly '' humor . Frankly , the amount go through the roof . Do n't get me started on the gross-out stuff . The sarcastic , verbal wit can still be great , though much le of it is than before . I 'd say about half of the episode were rather amusing and downright funny , while the other three did n't really get me into them at all . I wa disappointed in how predictable some of the plot and development thereof were ... I could see many of such coming a mile away . Some of the material try way too hard to be funny and wind up coming across a incredibly forced . This continues with the tradition started by `` II '' of letting the plan work out occasionally . The theme is the worst of the bunch , the credit sequence the least creative . All in all , this is , by far , my least favorite of the four . I recommend it to fan of the franchise and of British comedy in general . 7/10",1
An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive . I challenge anyone who is a `` Aliens ( James Cameron 1986 ) '' Movie fan to count how many time either line or almost entire sequence were ripped off from the first two Alien movie to make this classic piece of garbage . Cast member such a R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actor with any talent and the lead `` Jack Scalia '' wa really absolutely horrible . I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin . I wa also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder . Look him up sometime a he ha done a lot of interesting movie . But on this movie : The script a I said earlier wa a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine `` thriller '' . It included such line a `` I got a bad feeling about this '' and `` Kill me '' a one crew member is infected by one of the mutant and his belly start doing the `` alien hop '' just before it pop out of his stomach . There is also a rip-off of the classic `` get some ! '' via Bill Paxton . We also have a bunch of navy grunt running through cave with creepy crawlies popping out of wall . Even the explosion of the mutated creature is very similar to the popping of alien a they charge marine in the movie `` Aliens '' . And the kicker is that some of the mutant spit acid ( a opposed to having acid for blood ) . There are many more major example . So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classic Alien and Aliens ( With Sigourney Weaver ) . You 'll have a more enjoyable time . The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequence in the start of the movie and generally poor editing . Camera shot were pretty dull and honestly it wa n't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email . Many of the interaction between character made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not . The whole command structure between crew and Capt . wa poorly done . I 'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear sub . In general this just show that there wa little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar example ( like dive depth etc .. ) . If you like horrible movie or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you . As for me this one is going back on the shelf ... permanently .,0
"Now this is what I 'd call a good horror . With occult/supernatural undertone , this nice low-budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene . This prof you do n't need wild FX or lot of gore to make an effective horror movie . The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison , and each of these character ( and their motif ) become gradually more interesting , a the movie build up tension to the finale . Most of the action we see through the eye of Carrere , who ha just entered prison and ha to get used to living with these 3 other inmate . I wo n't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen . There a few flaw though : the FX are not that good , but they 're used effectively ; the plot leaf some mystery open ; and thing get very confusing towards the end , but Malefique redeems itself by the time it 's over . I thought his wa a very good movie , 8/10",1
"This is a voice of a person , who just finished watching the second season of Rome , almost at one go , and grabbed the opportunity to see `` what happened next '' - this film conveniently take off where Rome end . If you find Rome an abomination , a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy , then you might enjoy Imperium : Augustus . But , if you feel Rome is a good thing , if you enjoy the complicated intrigue , the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actor , then Imperium will obviously appear to you a an overly timid , superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factor . There are some actor who for my taste look somewhat better than these in Rome . I especially disliked Rome 's image of Cleopatra a a drug-soaked sex addict . There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman , and the actress in Imperium suit the part much better . O'Toole and Rampling are good , and so are some others . But then ... If you have come to know - and love - Atia a the super cool bitch , you 'll find the depiction of her in Imperium - a a tear-jerking mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous . There are supposed to be some bitchy character in Imperium , but these actress rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more . You 'll find no interesting female character in this epic . There 's also the painfully comic Maecenas , whom we see a a screeching drag queen , even though there is little historical evidence that he wa such ( he 's once referred to a `` being effeminate in his pleasure '' in the annals ) . The interior are rather meager and rely on clichés upon clichés . Cleopatra 's big hall look like something out of a computer game or a child 's play room in an Egyptian theme park . There 's a looooooooot of really poor 3D graphic , not up to 2003 standard . The action is presented a a series of flashback the aged Augustus is reliving . So we get a quick look at some historical event , some of which are presented well , whereas some are not . An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia a the `` eternal flame '' of Augustus . This affair doe n't sizzle for even a moment , the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-inducing musical score . Whatever amount of reality the show aim to capture , every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing ( most of the actor are non English speaker ) . Everything is lukewarm in this epic . True , there are more historical accuracy than in Rome , but dramatically speaking , it 's plain boring . The character lack depth and the dialog sharpness . Camera-work is often reduced to static shot , and lighting offer nothing to please your eye . There 's really no-one to love and no-one to hate in Imperium . Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome , there are much better film and miniseries around . Ancient Rome : The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend .",0
"This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle . The Original Drum and Bass . There seems to be very little early Who footage around these day , if there is more then let be 'aving it , now-a-days it tends to be of a very different kind of Who altogether , a parody , a shadow of their ( much ) better year . To be fair , not one of them ha to prove anything to anyone anymore , they 've earned their respect and with overtime . This concert footage for me is one of their best . To command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed take skill , charisma , wit and a whole lot of bloody good music . We all know of the other act on the bill , The Doors ( their last ever show week before Jim Morrison died ) , Moody Blues , Hendrix , Taste , Free and many more . The point being that whoever were there it wa The Who that the majority had come to see . This show wa one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960 's ; Woodstock . The film and record had come out and so had The Who 's greatest work to date , Tommy . The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste , to be able to experience their own unique event , to be able to `` Grove and Love '' in the knowledge that this gig wa their own . To do this you needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd . At two ' o clock in the morning in late August 1970 the M.C . announces , `` Ladies and Gentlemen , a small Rock 'n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London , the 'OO '' . John Entwistle 's body suit is of black leather , on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe , Roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel 's and long flowing hair , Keith in a white t-shirt and jean , a Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins that he 'd preferred to wear . The Who never stopped their onslaught of High Energy Rock for over two hour , performing theirs and other artist ' greatest track such a Young Man Blues , Shaking ' all Over , and then a on queue , Keith baiting the crowed to `` Shut up , it 's a bleeding Opera '' with Tommy , the Rock Opera . The crowed went wild . This is what they had come to hear , and the Who did n't disappoint , straight into Overture and never coming up for air until the final note of `` Tommy can you Hear me ? '' Amazing . To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a Festival that wa to be the last of it kind anywhere in the World wa a fantastic piece of Cinematic History . The English DVD only come in a soundtrack of English/Linear PCM Stereo , were a in the States , I think , you can get it with 5.1 at least , `` Check local press for detail '' on that , okay . The duration of the DVD is 85 minute with no extra , which is a disappointment . Yes , for a slice of Rock and Festival History this DVD would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play , for some of the best Who concert footage a it wa meant to be , Live , Raw and in your Face ! I would have given this DVD ten if it wa n't for the lack of 5.1 , and some extra would have been nice . Thanks Roger , Pete , John and Keith .",1
"This film ha some pretty gorey part like a boob getting bit off and a other big bite . Castle Freak himself is a good monster . I would be scared to piece if he wa coming after me . However , the movie had some dumb part about it . A husband go drunk driving and kill his 3 year old son and blind his teenage daughter . I suppose death is a greater damage than blindness , but you 'd never know that the parent actually feel bad about their daughter being blind . All they care about is that `` J.J. 's dead ! '' While their teenage daughter walk around running into thing and talking about how she 'll never be able to drive a car . The parent are like - `` honey , stop walking around without a guide , you know better than that , '' and then they cry and do n't ever stop being depressed because JJ 's dead . Sounds like favortism to me . The line of dialogue are not very realistic or well done . For example , when a giant crash is heard in the castle , everybody run down into the basement to see what it wa . It wa a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered . The husband run to the broken mirror in horror and plainly say , `` The mirror broke . '' I do n't know , I would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle . The husband and wife have some major relationship problem and it 's funny to watch how dumb they are with each other . No one ever belief the blind girl . Advice : If a blind girl say she hears thing , believe her and do n't tell her to shut up . I think this is the moral of the story . Listen to people when they tell you thing or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your point . Lastly , I thought the best character wa the main police officer . He wa the best actor and character . Everyone else ( besides Castle Freak ) wa pretty run of the mill . 3/10",0
"From the first scene , I wa really excited . `` I can tell this is going to be awesome ! '' I thought . The acting wa so good , I felt a though I wa eaves-dropping on these people ' life . The music too wa exquisitely unsettling . The plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward ( one could sense ) toward some irrevocable fate . The build wa slow , but I personally love that kind of thing , a long a the quiet tension stay on track and doe n't get derailed before it 's ready to pay off . So everything 's going fine , and then the firework begin , and before you know it , the credit are rolling . `` WHAT ? ! ! ! '' wa all I and my movie-night companion could say . If you understand the director 's intention , the blunt ending doe make sense ( for those of you who have seen the movie already , check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com ) , but I ca n't help saying it wa not pulled off quite right . This probably could have been resolved with a little a ten more minute of material before the climax . In any case , it 's too bad . Those ten minute could have made all the difference in the world . ( But for those of you who do n't write or make film , you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a HUGE pain in the butt , and I am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal ! ) Wendigo feel to me like a masterpiece that wa given up on before it wa finished . But hay , I 'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effect ( like most horror movie these day ) . One other comment . Some of the monster scene left me confused a to whether I should be scared or laughing . I do n't know how to explain it , but there wa a distinctively Monty Python feel about this monster in his more blatent `` monster '' form . Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie -- I do n't know , it still worked for me in some crooked way . I will never look at deer antler in the same way again ! : )",1
"What if a platoon of G.I . 's from the Japanese army were to be send back in time 400 year right in the middle of the feudal war that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate ? Great pitch right ? The movie doe exactly what it say on the tin . Thankfully the writer did n't bother to explain the , usually ridiculous in sci-fi movie , scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport . No how 's or why 's . They just did . However the time transport sequence itself is trippy a hell and quite beautiful , if not a bit dated . Not a silly a one would imagine . The rest of the movie follows the premise to a T. But while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the G.I.s arrival to medieval Japan , it pick up with a devastating battle sequence . Undoubtedly it 's the main order of the day . The whole concept and by extension the movie itself , wa probably originated from this simple pitch : what if G.I . 's equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurai ? And boy doe it deliver . The main battle sequence that span more than half an hour is probably one of THE best of it kind in 70 's action/war movie . Not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length , it 's also a terrific mish-mash of style and technique that only unique premise like G.I . Samurai can deliver . I mean , where else would you get the chance to feature tank , ninja complete with shuriikens , a helicopter and samurai in the same shot ? The G.I . platoon led by lieutenant Iba tear literally through hundred of extra , gunning them down with machine gun , mortar , grenade and tank . This mish-mash of style is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of Kurosawa 's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki 's Samurai Banners , while the other is in western action and war movie . There are stylistic touch ( like the wonderful slow-motion shot and bloody violence ) that bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari circa Keoma to mind . Japanese cinema ha always been influenced by western and other Hollywood work and vice versa , and G.I . Samurai effortlessly turn this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film . The film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefit immensely from it . Not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent , it 's just that it doe n't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audience that enjoy laughing at their movie . The budget wa probably hefty , a it is evident in the hundred of extra , elaborate costume ( very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki ) and special effect . The camera-work and editing are all top notch , almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambition deserves . It 's not withouts it flaw either of course . There are many `` song '' scene , where all sort of 70 's Japanese rock , disco and country song play over montage ( there 's a bonding scene , a love-interest scene , a `` war is hell '' scene etc ) . The song themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing . Although it clock at a whooping 140 minute , it fly like a bullet for the most part . Still some scene , flashback and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect . The cast also deserves a mention , featuring such prominent name a Sonny Chiba , Isao Natsuyagi ( Goyokin , Samurai Wolf ) , Tsunehiko Watase ( The Yakuza Papers ) and Hiroyuki Sanada , all of them hitting the right note .",1
"Manipulative drama about a glamorous model ( Margaux Hemingway ) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician ( Chris Sarandon ) – to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister ( played by real-life sibling Mariel ) , whose music teacher he is . While the central courtroom action hold the attention – thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft a Hemingway ’ s lawyer – the film is too often merely glossy , but also dramatically unconvincing : the jury ostensibly take the musician ’ s side because a ) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b ) she wa offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together . What the f * * * ? ! ; she wa clearly tied up – what resistance could she realistically offer ? The second half of the film – involving Sarandon ’ s rape of the sister , which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE ( 2002 ) by occurring in a tunnel – is rather contrived : Mariel ’ s character should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to her sister , but Margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately ! The climax – in which Sarandon get his just dessert , with Margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante – is , however , a crowd-pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH ( 1974 ) ; incidentally , ubiquitous Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis wa behind both film . It ’ s worth noting how the two Hemingway sister ’ life took wildly different turn ( this wa the film debut of both ) : Margaux ’ s career never took off ( despite her undeniable good look and commendable participation here ) – while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen ’ s MANHATTAN ( 1979 ) and , interestingly , would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real-life “ Playboy ” centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse ’ s STAR 80 ( 1983 ) . With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriage , Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 ; chillingly , the Hemingway family had a history of suicide – notably the sister ’ grandfather , celebrated author Ernest , who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961 .",0
"This all-but-ignored masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional character in a movie ( Head ) , and that everything they do or say had already been written in an ( unseen ) script they seem to be following . Head wa written by Jack Nicholson , Rafelson , and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel . The other three Monkees only acted in it . They fight this every way they can by doing thing not in the script . They deliberately flub their line , walk off set , tear up scenery , punch other actor for no reason ; and ultimately , commit suicide by jumping off a bridge . For instance , in the rapid flash of a psychedelic party scene , if you watch frame-by-frame , you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman , very deliberately shooting into a mirror . He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actor who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the Director yell `` cut ! '' The Monkees , however , never drop out of character because those character are also who they really are . That end up being the core of the Revelation soon to come . At every turn , they realize their increasingly-bizarre action were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they ca n't escape being in . You say they went crazy and walked through the sky ( which turn out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling a the set 's background ) ? No problem ! Hey , hey , they 're the Monkees , and those wacky guy just keep monkeying around ! In the end , even their death did not set them free . That wa how the movie wa supposed to end , and their motionless , waterlogged body are fished out of the river , put in another box , and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the character are needed again for another studio production . This is made all the more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional character who forced themselves into the real world . They did it through the power of their music . Ironically , near the end , Peter Tork ha what he rightly see a a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem , but unfortunately , no one listens . Peter realizes : `` It doe n't MATTER if we 're in the box ( the film ) '' . He mean that it doe n't matter if will is free or illusory , and that `` the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur ... You need to just let 'now ' HAPPEN , a it happens '' , without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is `` valid '' by some abstract definition . When you ca n't even tell the difference , will being free or not doe n't matter -- tying to figure out if you are the `` real '' you is just a pointless waste of time . I saw this film at a very important time in my life . I wa trying to figure out how to escape being just `` that geeky , creepy nerd girl '' by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun ( i.e. , sex ) like everyone else did . But the revelation in Head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know . For decade , I 've watched `` Head '' and wished I could thank Pete . Was this a good movie ? Uhh , how about , like ... == < YES > ==",1
"I thought the movie wa a poor documentary . Nothing of substance wa discussed . It seemed to cheapen the idea and did not provide anything new . The film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science . Most scientist appeared `` stereotyped '' and sometimes weird . A woman said that her award did n't matter a whole lot , only child that were helped . She said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her award . Playing `` humble scientist '' , are we ? `` I have equation dancing in my head , '' another said . I do n't see how that explains anything to u . It ha n't covered significant effect of science on our culture . Politics of science were barely touched . Not a bad flick for a 10-14 year-olds . Other than that , I felt it wa boring and unrevealing . 4/10",0
"This movie is yet another in the long line of no budget , no effort , no talent movie shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renter at the video store . If you want to know what watching this movie is like , grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friend wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and `` attacking '' people . Congratulations , you 've just made `` Hood of the Living Dead '' ! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you . I have seen some low budget , shot on video film that displayed talent from the filmmaker and actor or at the very least effort , but this ha neither . Avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movie .",0
"Do n't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series . It is a six hour bore , an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other . There is no heat in this story , no real passion , no real romance . It is a dry , boring , drawn out , and uninspired a they come . And it doe n't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency . Take those six hour of your life and use them for something more worthwhile .",0
"There is a bit of a spoiler below , which could ruin the surprise of the ONE unexpected and truly funny scene in this film . There is also information about the first film in this series . I caught this film on DVD , which someone gave a a gift to my roommate . It came a a set together with the first film in the `` Blind Dead '' series . This movie wa certainly much worse than the first , `` La Noche del Terror Ciego '' . In addition , many of the feature of the first movie were changed significantly . To boot , the movie wa dubbed in English ( the first wa subtitled ) , which I tend to find distracting . The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar wa involved in heinous and secret ritual . Upon discovery of these crime , the local peasantry put the Templars to death in such a manner that their eye can no longer be used , thus preventing them from returning from Hell to exact their revenge . We then jump to modern time where because of some event , the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villager whose ancestor messed them up in the first place . Of course , since the undead knight have no eye , they can only find their victim when they make some sort of noise . The Templars were a secretive order , from about the 12th century , coming out of the Crusades . They were only around for about 150 year , before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others . Because they were secretive , there were always rumor about their ceremony , particularly for initiation . Also , because of the way the society wa organized , you did n't necessarily have church official overseeing thing , which meant they did n't have an inside man when thing heated up . And , because of the nature of their trial , they were tortured into confession . The order wa strongest in France , but did exist in Portugal and Spain , where the movie take place . Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knight drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin ( breast shot here , of course , this is a horror film after all ) , and then , once the knight come back to life , they attack their victim by eating them alive and sucking their blood ; in this sequel , this all disappears . You still have the same scene ( redone , not the same footage ) of them sacrificing the virgin , but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that . Thus , when they come back , they just hack people up with their sword or claw people to death , which I have to say is a much le effective mean of disturbing your audience . There 's also a time problem : in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars , where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasant burning these guy at the stake , which would date it around 1473 . And the way that the Templars lose their eye is much le interesting a well . In the first , they have them pecked out by crow . Now they are simply burned out , and in quite a ridiculous manner . Oh yeah , and maybe it wa just me , but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film ( despite having died ) . Not really a problem , since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation , but odd none-the-less . The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who us a child to distract the undead while he make a break for the jeep . The child 's father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep , so he walk out and tell her to find her father . It come somewhat out of the blue , and is easily the funniest scene in the film . Of course , why the child doe n't die at this point is beyond me , and disappointed for horror fan . I could n't possibly recommend this film to anyone . It is n't so bad that it becomes funny , so it just end up being a mediocre horror film . The bulk of the film ha several people holed up in a church , each making various attempt to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded . When the film end , you are not surprised at the outcome at all ; in fact , quite disappointed . If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film , see the first movie , which at least ha some innovative idea and not so expected outcome .",0
The film had many fundamental value of family and love . It expressed human emotion and wa an inspiring story . The script wa clear ( it wa very easy to understand making it perfect for child ) and wa enjoyable and humorous at time . There were a few charged symbol to look for . The cinematography wa acceptable . There wa no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographer have been doing today ( which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out ) . It wa plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it . Although editing could have been done better I thought it wa a nice movie for a family to enjoy . And the organization of information wa just thrown at you which wa something I did n't like either but in all it wa a good movie .,1
"An ear-splitting movie , a quasi-old-fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star Madonna 's comedic attribute . She doe indeed go far out on the proverbial limb here playing a beyond-vivacious parolee attempting to prove she wa framed for murder ( a body wa found in the trunk of her car after she ran a red light ... big laugh ) . After an energetic animated credit sequence -- which is much more fun than the rest of the picture -- we have nothing to look at but Madonna 's black mascara and red lip set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion . What else is there ? Griffin Dunne seems defeated playing Maddy 's keeper , while the poor-choice supporting cast struggle to get laugh with lousy dialogue . It 's an unfortunate set-back to the talent of director James Foley , who unwisely allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick film from the 1930s ( but even Katharine Hepburn in `` Bringing Up Baby '' had a human side ) . Wretched . * from * * * *",0
"A Murder investigation go on back stage while The Vanities , on it opening night , play on to an unknowing audience . Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for it cast , it production number , and the sheer novelty of the film . Gertrude Michael ha the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show 's star , Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson , a well a starring in the infamous `` Sweet Marijuana '' number ( which wa also on a 70 Bette Midler album ) . So while the chorus girl shuffle around backstage , bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girl while he try to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman . We quickly learn that the maid ( Dorothy Stickney ) love Brisson from afar , that the wardrobe lady ( Jessie Ralph ) is Brisson 's mother , and that the stage manager ( Jack Oakie ) butt into everything . Lots of plot twist among the musical number . The show 's best-known song is `` Cocktails for Two . '' Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting `` Where Do They Come From ? '' And there 's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington ! Quite the cast . Some terrific acting here , especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney . Kitty Carlisle is quite good a well . Brisson is a total zero though . Charles Middleton play Homer , Toby Wing play Nancy , Donald Meek play the doctor , and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girl .",1
"Daft potboiler do n't come much dafter than this , but it 's a Douglas Sirk movie which make everything alright . Except in this case it doe n't . Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas , ( he wrote `` The Robe '' ) , and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor , it 's got more uplift than a cantilever bra . Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feel responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight . To make amends he take up medicine , becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it . ( No , it si n't quite that daft ; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy ) . In between time , they fall in love . Try a I might I ca n't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of American more that are supposed to lie just below the surface of Sirk 's film , ( this one is n't too deep ) . On the plus side Rock Hudson is n't half bad , ( I think I am rediscovering him ) , and , of course , it look great , ( in Sirk 's film people live in room the size of cathedral ) . Nothing in this film match the best of his later work and even in soap-opera term this is definitely daytime TV .",0
"If you do n't mind having your emotion toyed with , then you wo n't mind this movie . On the other hand , if you enjoy British crime mystery , following clue and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end , you 'll be very disappointed . Here are some of the logical inconsistency that lead to that disappointment : * While the police utilize the CCTV camera early on to gather clue about the mystery , the huge truck that stopped and blocked the child 's view just before her disappearance doe n't get caught on camera . This is a critical piece of the mystery . It 's inconsistent to have the car the child were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery . * The movie go to great length to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the child 's movement but miss the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicle that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible location adjacent to the crime scene a part of developing clue . * In England , driving is on the left . The director go out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right , several meter away from the flower kiosk , when it could have easily parked immediately behind , or even on the side ; a the huge truck did . * The police forensics team is so meticulous a to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several mile from the scene of the crime , but ca n't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene , even though they secured the scene just hour after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall . * Search dog were not used at all to find the missing child ; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting . * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk . * It is illogical that the mother would go to such extreme and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clue under her fingernail for her eventual murder investigator even coaxing her daughter to do the same -- while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home . If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fiber under her nail , she could of just a easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that wa in a crowded residential park . * The suspect that abducted the little girl wa portrayed a mentally slow/dimwitted -- justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but , he wa smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his right not to self-incriminate . There are more inconsistency like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado 's disappointment . 'Five Days ' is a very weak British crime story .",0
"What is this ! ! it so bad . The animation look so terrible , it look like a ps1 type game . The actor are awful , they just can not act to save their life . I sat through all of this film an then at the end I wa annoyed when I realised I had wasted 3 hour of my life . I 've not heard of this film , did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to DVD ? A girl got shot ? ! What is up with that , it wa just a stupid film . They totally copied 'The Day After Tomorrow ' . Its got to be one of the worst film i have ever seen . I would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this . You could spend your time watching 'The Day After Tomorrow ' , it a lot better . Well thats what I think of the film . Actually why have I wasted my time writing about it , ah dam ! ! Its really annoying me , it wasted 3 hour and 10 minute now .",0

"For only doing a few movie with his life the Late Great Chris Farley . Farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in Tommy Boy , David Spade . From the lame Police Academy 4 Spade really ha done good with his career in film . Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch it . From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to doing Tommy Boy , Black Sheep , Beverley Hills Ninja , Almost Heroes , Billy Madison , and Dirty Work . I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career . Tommy Boy wa his best in my case and I would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time . Thank you Chris Farley .",1
"Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie . This type of movie are actually made for flop . What a shame that Yash Raj Films produce such movie those are worthless than C-grade movie . Or even some C-grade movie have better and pleasing story than Tashan . The much hyped and over-confidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deserved . In my view , this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films ' banner . How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who ha no actual sense of making action flick ? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi 's way of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last . The action scene are more like than comic or cartoon movie made for exhausting the audience . The story also loses in it meaning and substance to tenderly win the audience ' heart . In most scene Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body language and wordly expression . I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay , but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saif '' s hand instead of Akshay . Just from the starting point I expected of it , but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth . Saif is the main behind the whole adventure , while Akshay join in the midst . In any movie , the final should be judged with the whole character of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit . And Tashan loses in this way , and unexpectedly failed to become a hit . Akshay 's ha nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movie . He seriously need to form a new image to his fan that would impress them again and again . In between Saif did a great job in Race , and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie . But he ha fully developed himself in the acting field . And last but not the least about Kareena . She look really hot with bikini dress of which some complain a she became too lean . But I myself do n't think so , instead she became slim . Yes slim ! ! ! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people ( or say , male ) . Beside them it is nice that Saif 's son Ibrahim appears in the beginning & last a young Saif . I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting a his career . Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood , or say want to be admitted in an asylum . Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films . In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 year before going into practical direction . Sorry , I do n't like to rate good star to this type of junk movie .",0
"I wa so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this film three year ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it 's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it . It 's like taking a trip to India .... colorful , magical , thought provoking . Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic . This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it doe have drama and romance and humor . The interaction between the Indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental difference between Eastern and Western life style and philosophy . The character are a little broadly drawn but the acting wa very good . Visually this movie is a treat a you really do get a sense of what driving through Rajasthan is like ... dreamlike . Sometimes it 's hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real ... the movie ha that same quality . Great soundtrack too !",1
"I still ca n't believe that Wes Craven wa responsible for this piece of crap.This movie is worse than `` Deadly Friend '' .The plot is stupid , the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull.I do n't know why Wes Craven hate his debut `` Last House on the Left '' -an absolute masterpiece of the genre and like ( probably ) this turkey.Do n't get me wrong , I really like some of his movie , but it wa a real torture sitting and watching this .",0
"I had my doubt about another love story wherein disabled individual find meaning and redemption through honest communication . And it 's still not at the top of my list . But the performance from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary , almost stunning , and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker . Carter 's depiction of an ALS victim is strong , perhaps even overdone at time ( sometimes her dialog dissolve into undistinguishable muttering ) . But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding . Branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance .",1

"Warning : Does contain spoiler . Open Your Eyes If you have not seen this film and plan on doing so , just stop reading here and take my word for it . You have to see this film . I have seen it four time so far and I still have n't made up my mind a to what exactly happened in the film . That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film , then stop reading right now . If you are still reading then I am going to pose some question to you and maybe if anyone ha any answer you can email me and let me know what you think . I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well . His name wa Mr. Krisak . To me , he wa wise beyond his year and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you thing that perhaps you were n't all too keen on . If we did n't like Shakespeare , then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it . Our class room wa never a room , it wa a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time . This wa his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like mind . I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave u an assignment that ha been firmly etched in my mind , like the phone number of a long lost best friend , and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix . Now if I did n't know better , I would have thought that the Wachowski brother were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak . But giving them the benefit of the doubt , we 'll assume it wa n't him . But that wa the first time this assignment wa anything more than impalpable . He had asked u to prove to him and to ourselves that were real . Show me how you can tell that you are real . This got the class spouting off all of the usual idea that I 'm sure you can imagine . Everything from pain , to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real . After every scenario that we gave him , he would come back with the one answer that would leave u speechless . `` What if you are nothing but someone else 's dream ? '' What if you were someone else 's dream ? What a messed up question that is . This wa a question/scenario posed to u about 15 year ago , before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computer . How possible could it seem back then ? But if you look at today 's technology , now ask yourself , what it you were a part of someone else 's dream . Another brilliant but surreal film this year , David Lynch 's Mulholland Drive explored similar area . But Vanilla Sky go deeper than any other film could hope to . In short this is one film that will literally ( if you let it ) blow your mind from all of the possibility that surround you . Open your Eyes . Tom Cruise play David Aames , a young , hot shot , righteous , full of himself publisher and owner of several magazine . He inherited this from his father and although he ha talent and business savvy , his board of governers , the Seven Dwarfs , think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth . They feel he ha done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them belief should go to them . Early in the film we meet one of David 's gorgeous toy named Julie Gianni , played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz . David and Julie play a good game , both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous , committed relationship . This is the type of relationship commensurate with David 's other fling he 's had in the sexual prime of his life . And although both talk a good game , we can tell that only one is really telling the truth . Next we meet Brian Shelby , played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith 's good buddy Jason Lee . Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friend . This is something that David ha very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film . Brian ha one famous line that he keep telling David over and over again . And that is `` the sweet ai n't so sweet without the bitter . '' He go on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozy who inhabit his bed for a night or two . At David 's huge birthday bash , ( so huge that the like of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday ) Brian enters with his date , Sofia Sorrano , played of course by Penelope Cruz with what ha to be the best performance of this year by an actress . This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another . And in typical David fashion , despite his best friend being there , he begin to flirt with Sofia . To complicate thing , Julie show up uninvited and begin spying on David . David then spends the night with Sofia , but they only talk and draw caricature of one another . There is no hanky panky . The next day , a David is leaving Sofia 's apartment , he is greeted by Julie , who offer him a ride and from there ....... well , I think we have all seen the commercial . That is all I will really say about the plot , because from here the film tease u with what is reality and what is blurred perception . We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady character that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze . There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-all that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life . This is just one of the intriguing possibility the movie offer u , but it doe n't end there . Like many movie seem to thrive on today , this film ha a secret . Sixth Sense may have began this craze , but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze . Regardless of how it originated , Vanilla Sky ha one of it 's own surreptitious gut buster . And what make this one so much fun is that the film give you many obvious clue along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lie you have just put yourself through . I have seen this film four time and every time it ha been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up , something more I can understand . To be able to work your mind in the theater , to enable it to open up to new possibility is something rare in a film . All of the ersatz so called `` Best Pictures of the year '' have been good but nothing spectacular . They lack substance . A Beautiful Mind wa intriguing but flat , The Royal Tenenbaums wa interesting but uneven . Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaf you yearning for more yet guarantee your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it . I know this film ha received mixed review but I just think that those who do n't like it do n't quite understand it . This is what film making is supposed to be like . This is what a film is supposed to do to you . It is supposed to make you feel something . Most of the other film this year have been just empty space . This one is n't . 10 out of 10 The best film of the year . I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress , Diaz for best supporting , Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor . Cameron Crowe should there a well . None of this may come to pas , and that is a shame . This is one film that should not be missed . And on a final note , I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question . Can you prove you are real ? Or are we just a figment of someone 's imagination ? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else 's bemusement ? This is a film that spawn more question than it doe answer . And I 'm sure that is just fine with him . Open Your Eyes",1
"I saw this film yesterday .. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster .. In fact , I know one of the actress from the film .. I wo n't say who .. ! ( That 's kept under wrap .. ) But I must admit , it wa n't a good a I thought it would be .. Tom Savini ? Hats down to this guy .. But it 's a shame he wa n't in the film for long .. What lack the film is the idea , the script , sound , etc .. It may look like a good movie .. but it wa n't that entertaining .. Well , I 'm glad my Sister paid £10 for renting 3 DVD 's from Blockbuster .. I chose this one .. and I wa disappointed . Anyway , thumb down for me .. ! Not my cup of tea ! 0 out of 10 !",0
"I would reccomend this film to everyone . Not only to the fan of the rocker Luciano Ligabue , but to all film-buffs . Because it 's sincere , moving , funny and true . Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover , and every frame of his film is made with love and care . Because his character are loved and ask to be loved . Because most of the Italian debut film are lousy and this one , done by an outsider , is a real joy to watch and to listen at . Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza , who wa , like Freccia , beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin , that Ligabue show a it is , unglamorous and ugly , without indulging in easy moralism . Because it 's a film that speaks to our heart , our ear , our soul . And because I lived the experience of the FM radio and it wa exactly like that . Thanks , Luciano !",1
"Recognizing the picture of the diner on the cover of the DVD made me realize that this wa a local movie . The word Detroit in the title furthered my suspecions and I did some looking up of thing and yes , a local movie it wa . So I picked it up . Someone I knew actually knew some of the producers/director ( dont remember which ) and said the producers/directors got people to PAY to be in this movie . Brilliant ! What a great idea . The movie maker get some capital to do the movie with , thanks to their cast and crew . Then the investor ( cast , crew , others ) get some of the profit , I 'm imagining . Profits ! Um anyways . This film totally underwhelmed me . The special effect were special a in special child who ride the small bus to school . The acting wa very amusing , not intentionally however . There 's a great line where a guy say `` well ? this bone aint gon na smoke itself ! '' a a pickup line . Unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film . The story ? Well , I sort of followed it about 3/5 of the way in , then everything stopped making sense and a we were sitting there watching it , it suddenly ended . I mean a in , .. no resolution of anything .. like they ran out of time . `` Sorry folk , out of time , goodnight ! '' We sat there baffled and booing , and threw in another film . Then about 20 minute later a neighbor of mine showed up .. with one of the guy from the movie ! We threw it back in and he ( the actor ) gave u a running commentary , which wa awesome because he totally ripped on the movie ! What more could you ask for ? ? The most absurd scene for me wa a motorbike chase scene were it wa so dark that it could have literally been a guy running past with a flashlight and not a motorbike at all . That and the jaw droppingly in your face sudden ending is enough to make you howl . In pain ! The zombie looked le like zombie than my coworkers do . And I dont work at the morgue either . So , I recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running commentary a to all the thing that went on behind the scene and make sure this person hate the movie because that just add to the fun . Otherwise , give this one a pas . Rent something like Feeders if you want a jaw droppingly bad in a funny way movie ...",0
"One hour , eight minute and twelve second into this flick and I decided it wa pretty lame . That wa right after Hopalong ( Chris Lybbert ) drop on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse . I wa pretty mystified by the whole Hopalong Cassidy/Great Bar 20 gimmick which did n't translate into anything at all . Obviously , the name Coppola in the credit could n't do anything to guarantee success here , even with more than one listed . If you make it to the end of the film , you 'll probably wind up asking yourself the same question I did . What exactly wa the hook with the glove ? What 's up with the rodeo scenario ? Who wa The Stranger supposed to represent ? Why did they make this film ? I could probably go on but my energy 's been drained . Look , there 's already a Western called `` The Gunfighter '' from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck a the title character . Watching it will make you feel a good a watching this one make you feel bad . That one I can recommend .",0
"Caddyshack II is NOTHING compared to the original Caddyshack . But , there are legitimate reason for it . ( 1 ) Rodney Dangerfield wa supposed to be the ace of this film BUT he did n't like the script , wanted to change it , his request wa denied , so he did n't do the film . ( 2 ) It wa low budget , Bill Murray had grown to superstar status . Ted Knight passed away in 1986 , and Chevy Chase the `` so called ace '' of the first movie ( although it wa Rodney all the way ) couldn't't be on more than 5 minute , because it would cost too much to pay him . BUT you had Dan Aykroyd , Robert Stack , Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason , all serviceable substitute , who none had their best performance .",0
"The youthful group in `` St. Elmo 's Fire '' who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much le four year at any prominent university . For the most part , these kid are irresponsible , selfish , greedy and stupid , yet co-writer and director Joel Schumacher appears to hold them up a touchstone for a generation . With a now-outdated cast of `` up and comer '' , a background score that sound awfully similar to that of `` Terms Of Endearment '' , and writing which lord the smugness of this circle over u , `` Fire '' is a paltry blaze , one that get even more embarrassing a the year pas on . * 1/2 from * * * *",0
"The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin . And gross . An obese lawyer drive over the Gypsy woman , and the Gypsy curse cause him to lose and lose weight ... to the bone . OK , Gypsy curse should be entertaining , but the weight-losing gone bad ? Nope . Except Stephen King think so . And Michael McDowell , other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film , doe so , too . The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible , he is fat too , haha ! The Thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moan how he/she ha never seen anything so disgusting than fatness . Hey , I can only say : Well , look at the mirror .",0
"American Pie ha gone a long distance from the first . At first i believe the actor do n't have a clue what their doing and instead it 's just a remake of a college party gone nut . Story set out a two freshman college guy ( featuring the young stifler ) setting out the dream of attending college just to experience the late night party , sex and of course the booze . The plot is stupid and come along way away from the original pie . In fact they did n't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film . Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free . But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex film with absolute nudity and insane drinking . I 'm a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty would 've been a better choice instead .",0
The best movie about friendship ! Especially between an AIDs infected person and a `` normal `` person . This is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used . I have seen it 25 time .,1
"Revolt of the Zombies ha no redeeming feature . I 'm tired of people arguing that it 's not that bad , and that the effect must have packed more of a punch in 1936 . I suspect this is n't true : it 's not like IQ 's have risen sharply in the last 7 decade . The average viewer in 1936 wa probably just a bored by this rubbish a the average viewer today . Why ? Just try watching the first scene , and count the pause between thing happening , the awful choice of when to cut to close-up , the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two second on every shot to pad out the running time . Pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue : `` I 'm going to make some tea/go outside/read my book now . '' `` Are you ? '' `` Yes , I am . '' That sort of exchange happens several time . Normally I would love that , being a HUGE fan of bad movie , but watch the listless actor mumbling their trite and tedious line , and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fade away . This sort of disinterested , pot-boiling time-waster is far worse than energetic , imaginative mind-blowers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians . Those who claim that this is `` better '' than those more interesting movie have a backwards idea of entertainment . This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hang open in astonishment : it 's bad in the sense that your eye slowly close in boredom . Which is far worse .",0
"Hilariously inept - like `` She Wore A Yellow Ribbon '' remade by five-year-olds . Spoilers ahead : Despite it title , and the high bodycount , `` Slaughter Trail '' is in fact a musical with Injun battle instead of dance number . If you ever wondered what Ed Wood might have done with a B-movie budget , this film should answer your question . Some decision may have been bad only in retrospect , such a filming in the short-lived Cinecolor process , which resulted in face changing hue within the same shot . But there wa definitely some ill-advised skimping on the film 's main set , a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a Norman castle . Terry Gilkyson , who later wrote the 'The Bare Necessities ' for Disney 's `` The Jungle Book '' , supply a score full of original ditty which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit Western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup . One song tell how `` horse hoof pound , and their melody sound , like the hoofbeat serenade '' ... during a dead-serious scene of a cavalry patrol . Other song literally narrate the story shot by shot , introducing character , describing their mood and gesture - a they happen on screen - and even stop to advertise the Cinecolor process ( ! ) The script sends ferocious Navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio . By the end of the film , what look like a hundred Navajos and cavalryman have bitten the dust ( thanks to repeated footage of the same character dying over and over . ) But the chief is satisfied once he see the trio of badguys have been slain . As the singer helpfully informs those of u who were n't paying attention , the Navajos ride away , their battle called off . The cavalry captain , surrounded by the corps of his fallen comrade , cheerily wave his appreciation . The direction could most charitably be described a wooden , or more to the point , Wood-en . Navajos are consistently shot off their horse in pair -- never just one . Virtually every red man on foot dy by throwing his hand in the air and keeling over . The film also employ the most cautious stuntmen in Hollywood , who crouch before dropping off a one-story roof ( and still fail to stick the landing ) or turn to look behind them a they slide , `` dead '' , down a rocky slope . The star is Brian Donlevy , who surely deserves an Oscar for not blushing . After the endless final battle scene -- `` climax '' is scarcely the word -- he scan a list of the dozen of his trooper killed , and shrug , `` It could 've been a LOT worse . '' Trooper Andy Devine get to sing and robber/murderer Gig Young laugh at Andy 's antic ... which lead a character who had been held up by masked bandit to rat Gig out : `` I 'd know that laugh anywhere ! '' And lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work Howard Hughes could be , recall that a head of RKO , Hughes wa first in line to blacklist original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC denounced him . It would take Hughes another six year to finish running that once-celebrated studio into the ground , but it did n't help thing when he insisted on reshooting Da Silva 's every scene for this film , substituting Donlevy . It wa nearly a decade before Da Silva wa able to work in Hollywood again . But all thing considered , for getting him out of `` Slaughter Trail '' , he should have sent Hughes a thank-you note .",0
"Oh man . If you want to give your internal Crow T. Robot a real workout , this is the movie to pop into the ol ' VCR . The potential for cut-up line in this film is just endless . ( Minor spoiler ahead . Hey , do you really care if a film of this quality is `` spoiled ? '' ) Traci is a girl with a problem . Psychology ha developed name for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite-sex parent . But this girl seems to have one for her same-sex one , and I do n't think there 's a term for that . It might be because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette , whose cute overbite , neo-flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure make me forgive her any number of bad movie or unsympathetic character . Here Dana is not only clueless to her daughter 's conduct ; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition . It 's possible that Dana miss Traci 's murderous streak because truth be told , Traci seems to have the criminal skill of a hamster . It 's only because the script dictate so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count . A particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of Carmen , a Mexican maid who is described by Dana a around so long she 's like one of the family although she dress in what the director thought would say , `` I just fell off the tomato truck from Guadalajara . '' Carmen is so wise to Traci 's scheming , she might also wear a sign saying , `` Hey , I 'm the Next Victim ! '' Sure enough , Traci confronts Carmen a Carmen is making her way back from Mass , and bop her with one of those slightly angled lug wrench that car manufacturer put next to your spare a a bad joke . I rather suspect than in real life those thing are a useless a a murder weapon a they are for changing a tire . In another sequence , Arquette wear a flimsy dress to a vineyard , under cloudy sky , talking to the owner . Cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny sky , talking to the owner 's brother . Then cut to her wearing the first dress , in the first location , under cloudy sky - but it 's supposed to be later . You get the picture . We 're talking really bad directing . As for skin , do n't expect much , although Traci doe own a nice couple of bikini . For those looking for a trash wallow , 8 . For anybody else , 1/2 .",0
"This is an excellent , suspenseful , murder-mystery movie . Not only wa the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous Ryan Gosling for a couple hour , what 's not to love ! Also , Sandra Bullock is good in this movie - I 've always been a fan of hers , ( I just wish she had n't decided to be in `` The Lake House '' which wa horrible , but that 's another story altogether ) . Obviously since there are thousand of other murder/horror movie out there , there are bound to be similarity between them , no need to bash this movie for having some similarity to at least a few that have already been made . Anyway , this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy `` scary '' movie , it 's a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie ! ! !",1
"Brides are dying at the altar , and their corps are disappearing . Everybody is concerned , but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening , nor can they prevent it from happening . Bear with me . Bela Lugosi is responsible for this , a he is extracting spinal fluid from these young woman to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive . Continue to bear with me . Finally , the authority figure out that somebody must be engineering the death and disappearance , but of course , they ca n't figure out the improbable motive . Let 's just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on ... If you can get through the first twenty minute of this mess , you will be treated to Lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the bride he ha murdered , explaining that he find sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed , and other vague parody of real horror film ( the kind with budget and plot ) . Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit ( and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen ! ) , and then the fun really start . The cinematography and acting are OK . There are a lot of well dressed , very good looking people in this film . The directing is fair , and the script is a little better than the material deserved . Nevertheless , this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b-film fan . The best thing about it .... It doe eventually end , but not soon enough .",0
"On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what ha happened , but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear . I enjoyed this movie . Dean Cain wa excellent in the role of Bob . Lexa Doig 's character wa confusing to understand , at first , she wa out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart . Dean Cain 's performance wa an usual excellent . He get better with every film he doe . My only question at the end of the film wa what happened to Bob , Camilla and the baby . It wa left for the viewer to decide",1
"The comment already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate . I feel exactly the same way , that I am very disappointed at how far Rick Mercer ha fallen when he used to do some really great thing on This Hour Has 22 Minutes but now he is just clowning around , going place and talking to people . He doe some bit in the studio about thing going on in the news but they are never funny at all , just really sad and predictable joke about headline . Most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people , for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video piece are all of him making funny face and acting scared of the wild horse , etc . He used to be funny but ha gotten way le funny since leaving This Hour Has 22 Minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more . Now that Air Farce is off the air ( finally thank goodness ! ) Mercer and This Hour Has 22 Minutes have got to be next in line for the axe , just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody find funny any more . It 's sad really considering Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian TV !",0
"Wow , this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends . If you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer ( if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do . ) and watch a couple of episode , it 's the perfect recipe for happiness . The thing I like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing . After a while you become attached to the character and really care about them . I think the secret to the show success is that they have an enviable life . Doug is fat but still happy with it , he love his wife his job and his friend . The father in law is the fly in the ointment but hey nothing perfect .",1
"`` Ah Ritchie 's made another gangster film with Statham '' thought the average fan , expecting another Snatch/Lock Stock ; expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shift , but none too hard for `` me and the lad '' to swallow after a few beer . Ah , pay attention , you do need to watch this film . No cup of tea , no extra diet coke from the counter , no `` keep it running '' shout a you nip to the fridge - watch the film ! No laugh other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence ( and if that float your boat , so be it ) but sharp solid direction , excellent dialogue , and great performance . My favourite - Big Pussy from The Sopranos , always a reliable hood .",1
"I saw The Glacier Fox in the theatre when I wa nine year old - I bugged my parent to take me back three time . I began looking for it on video about five year ago , finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site , but I would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased ( I understand the original video run wa small ) , or have the right purchased by The Family Channel , Disney , etc . and shown regularly . It is a fascinating film that draw you into the story of the life struggle of a family of fox in northern Japan , narrated by a wise old tree . The excellent soundtrack compliment the film well . It would be a good seller today , better than many of the weak offering to child 's movie today .",1
"Would you be surprised if I told you this movie deal with a conspiracy ? No ? How about if I told you the ringleader wa a shadow puppet . What ? You do n't believe me ? ... OK . Yes , I made that up . It 's too bad , this movie could have used a sense of humor . I understand Charlie Sheen doing this at the time - another movie equaled more money - a for Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why ? Do n't even get me started on Stephen Lang . He wa so much fun a the Party Crasher in 'The Hard Way ' and now this junk . Ah no matter . Everyone involved should feel ashamed . If you aim to make a bad movie and succeed - it 's twisted - but I seriously doubt that wa what they were aiming for here . Flat out , the story stink and we 're actually supposed to take this yak seriously . Makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope . Seriously , I doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse string how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me . Maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it 's way to theater ! ? Oh ... Sam Waterson , how great you are in Law & Order . Why are you here ? Demoting yourself to the role of the President of the United States who might I add get to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin . Then again this is a masterpiece of work from George P. Cosmatos who 's `` directing '' credit include Rambo : First Blood Part II amongst other gem . Hmm .... case in point ?",0
This film wa absolutely ... ugh i ca n't find the word oh wait ... crap ! I mean when it started i wa like yeah this look good and then after it wa so boring . I nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it wa utter filth . Ram Gopal Varma ha tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original Sholay i mean what wa he thinking doing a remake . What wa he trying to do ? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the award next year like he did for Black ? Ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he wa the one to look at . What wa Amitabh doing ? He 's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid film . First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this i mean he got to gather a bit of his money and move a far away from Bollywood a possible before he loses all his respect and I 'm telling you he 's already past half his way . I mean all this is really good for the other actor like Shah Rukh Khan who 's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of Amitabh . I never really liked him because he think he 's God and i just knew Abhishek wa going to be in that movie . If you want to save your £17.75 and spend it on something good go watch Heyy Babyy because that 's just the funniest movie ever and it 's number one in the chart !,0
"French Cinema suck ! Down with all these psychiotric vision with their my-God-am-I-cultivated distinguished attitude ! Pestilence to conceited symbolic film-language and impervious chiffres ! I 'll no longer have a mind for that ! Léos Carax , did you ever think about , that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid ? ? ? Maybe I 'm too common to understand you ?

Other example : She , beautiful and willing , is looking at herself in a mirror , combing her hair , and her wild-bearded , dirty young guru rush into the room , breathless shouting : `` There 's no escape , there 's no escape !

My God , there 's that woman and she love and admires you , what would be more natural to be happy with your life ? And when you 're not , please explain much better , why ! !

Some guy , vince offer , who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk/high -- probably both -- and thought it wa a great idea to make a movie . He then proceeded to show his script to equally high/drunk individual . Overall , this movie wa so bad , predictable , and unoriginal I could n't get through 20 minute of it before I turned it off . It make You Got Served look like Citizen Kane . Bat Man ? WTF ... Some guy that walk around with a bat , real original . Almost a good a calling him Fat Man , and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit .",0
"A comedy that worked surprisingly well wa the little British effort `` The Divorce Of Lady X ( 1938 ) '' . It mark the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon , before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century English moor . And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly well-suited to screwball comedy , it all flow along nicely . Oberon is Leslie , a young woman who end up in priggish divorce lawyer Logan 's ( Olivier ) hotel suite by way of a nasty English fog preventing travel . She doe everything possible to irritate him -- but , in the crazy way film go , he fall for her . And she fall for him . But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon 's `` Lady X '' ( that 's all she leaf Oliver in a note ) is thought by Olivier to be a married woman . To make matter worse , and more amusing , Lord Mere ( Ralph Richardson ) go to Olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear Larry think must be Oberon ! There is some nice battle-of-the-sexes dialogue , and fun exploration of sexual politics . You can see that Olivier is not too confident with the comedy , but in true Olivier he 's a consummate professional , and delivers . And he handle the screwball twist and turn , maybe not with ease , but with gusto . Oberon wa no great shake a an actress , but she wa usually competent enough , and despite their reputed off-screen dislike of her , worked well with Olivier . This wa filmed in early Technicolour that look very primitive today ( everyone look even whiter than Michael Jackson ) , but perhaps the print need cleaning up .",1
"This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movie I have ever seen . It doe not seek to tell the whole story , but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ . It is darkly witty , playful and seriously faithful to element of the Jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation . Judas is much more ordinary than other portrayal , not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine , but a grossly mistaken man , horribly misguided in his zeal . Chris Saranden 's Jesus is playful and serious , faithful and committed -- very human while also divine . The final dialog is thoughtfully done and serf a the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity . I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others .",1
"This is one of the most ridiculous western that Hollywood ever made . Gary Cooper play 'Reb Hollister ' , a former confederate officer wanted by the law . He meet up with a moron named Weatherby , played by Leif Erickson , who is a U.S . Marshal with no knowledge of firearm . Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee , Tonia Robles , played by Ruth Roman . Senor Robles , Tonia 's father , ha plenty of men , but they ca n't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle , which are regularly rustled by the Marlow brother . Will Marlow , played by Raymond Massey , ha financed the loan on the Robles estate , making thing completely absurd . He even ha the power to call for mortgage payment before they 're due , simply because he feel like it . Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who ca n't fight , since he only became a Marshal so he could visit his fiancee , Tonia , ( Just another instance of more plot nonsense . Are we to assume that you only have to pas a written test to get this job ? Wait a minute , this guy could n't pas the written test either . ) he switch identity with Reb Hollister , who of course is an expert gunman . Reb take the liberty of greeting Weatherby 's girl with a passionate kiss , while Weatherby look on like an idiot . Gary Cooper , Hollywood 's number one stud , is in fine form here a Reb . Before the movie 's done , not only doe he take Weatherby 's job , he steal his fiancee also , and Ruth Roman a Tonia , fall for him so hard and so fast that she give chump Leif Erickson the brush-off before the film little more than half over . There is n't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film , so despite the good cast and lush photography , the film is a dud . And Cooper 's character is a complete heel to boot . The film also star Barbara Payton a Brant Marlow 's girl , a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chance , unfortunately , by making too many headline for the wrong reason . I strongly suggest you pas this one up .",0
"This kind of `` inspirational '' saccharine is enough to make you sick . It telegraph it sentiment like the biggest semaphore on earth . It remove from the audience it own interpretation and feeling by making the choice for it . The big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cable on a dead car ; I guess you 'd need such prompting to feel if you 're stupid enough to watch a film a simple-minded and sappy a this . Streep glow and you wonder if she really ha the depth of feeling on display or if it 's just that -- -a display , switched on and off like a light . Because I ca n't for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film . Even though it 's based on a true story , and an inspirational one at that I 'm sure , the set-up , execution and performance play like a third-rate TV movie or half-witted high school drama .",0

"I had watched snippet from this a a kid but , while I purchased Blue Underground 's set immediately due to it being a Limited Edition , only now did I fit it in my viewing schedule - and that 's mainly because Bakshi 's American POP ( 1981 ) just turned up on late-night Italian TV ( see my review of that film below ) ! Anyway , I found the film to be a quite good sword-and-sorcery animated epic with especially impressive-looking backdrop ( the rather awkward rotoscoped character were , admittedly , le so ) with a rousing if derivative score . The plot , again , wa n't exactly original , but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading character well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous Ice-lord Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf ; the hero and heroine , however , are rather bland stereotype - but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta depict the girl a well-endowed ( her bra could be torn off any second ) and half-naked to boot ( her tiny panty are forever disappearing up her as ) ! Still , it 's clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front ( that involving Darkwolf being particularly savage ) ; the final showdown though brief , is also nicely handled and see our hero astride pterodactyl assaulting the villain ' lair inside a cave . In the long run , apart from the afore-mentioned Frazetta backdrop , the main appeal of this movie for me now is it nostalgia factor a it transported me back to my childhood day of watching not just film like CONAN THE BARBARIAN ( 1982 ) and THE BEASTMASTER ( 1982 ) but also animated TV series such a BLACKSTAR ( 1981-82 ) and HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE ( 1983-85 ) . As for the accompanying THE MAKING OF `` FIRE AND ICE '' ( TV ) ( Mark Bakshi , 1982 ) * * 1/2 : Vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself ! It go into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also show several instance of live-action 'performances ' ( in a studio ) of segment from the script - which would then be traced , blended in with the background and filmed . Still , having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation ( on the Disney Tins and the Looney Tunes set , for instance ) , it 's doe n't make for a very compelling piece ...",1

Otherwise , do n't bother ! I saw the movie today with my nephew and 3 of their friend . They really loved it and that made me feel good . After the movie wa over , all the kid ( my nephew and their friend ) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater . The CG is good . Acting and directing are horrible . Storyline is extremely simple . But , since the half of the audience wa kid , they were screaming , shouting and cheering every time the dragon appeared on the screen . This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been . It 's a good movie to take your kid to , but except for the final battle sequence , D-War is disappointing . I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kid loved it so much .",1
"No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer ; it 's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one . While this movie is not without it interesting element ( mullet from hell , etc . ) , it is outweighed by flaw . For one thing , Angela , the murderous counselor , appears to be about the same age a the camper . Having an older , more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film . And then you have the murder scene . The budget wa apparently too low to execute most of them properly ( no pun intended ) , although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original . But overall , there are a ton of movie out there that are scarier/more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching .",0

Evidence of all the event in the movie ( except for his love interest ) can be found all over Victoria , in police record and even in the Sash that Ned wa awarded with for rescuing Dick Shelton from drowning . None of this is wrong , and whats left out would further justify Neds action . The Horse that Ned 'stole ' wa actually stolen by Wild Wright ( the man who Ned box with after getting out of jail ) . Ned wa already in prison when the horse wa reported stolen so he could n't have stolen it . The Jerilderie Letter is more than what ha been stated before . It is not self justification it is Ned 's biography , an outline of what he stood for and who he wa protecting . So go ahead and read it , watch the movie and then make up your mind about what Ned stood for .",1
"`` Feast of All Saints ? '' Where ... ? When ... ? Was the Feast of All Saints storyline and theme edited out ? What a waste of a wonderful title ! There is never anything in the story that ha the remotest connection to the `` Feast of All Saints . '' Nor is there anything in the story about `` All Souls Day '' which the term is referencing . Why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about `` All Souls Day '' or the `` Feast of All Saints '' ? Embarrassly Bad Script & Amateur Writing How did they attract such great talent to this clunker ? The writing is so amateur -- character that have known each other all their life go into big long speech about their life history for the sake of the audience . Not at all the way people talk to each other . What wa the Director Thinking ? The directing is equally bad ! The forced and overly deliberate style feel amateurish . In one scene , a character is yelling `` Take your hand off of me '' and NO ONE is touching him ! The most badly directed scene however , is the incredibly over-the-top battle scene at the beginning of the film . Excessive Gore in a Very Fake , Silly Battle Scene There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene . It look like a Saturday Night Live skit ! ! You can see extra waiting for their cue to walk across camera . Everyone play their death scene like 4th grade boy -- exaggerating every little gasp and twitch . The blood on battle victim is so excessive and carelessly applied it look like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight line of red on the costume . This whole battle scene come off a the spoof of a really cheesy war movie . You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline . Who in Real Life Would Ever Behave this Way ? ! The most ridiculous bit of writing , directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene : A little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father -- who is terribly mutilated , and literally dripping blood form his gaping wound . Even a totally idiot would know he is dead ! Yet she is -- very monotonously -- repeating over and over `` Daddy , daddy ... '' while looking at someone off-screen . She delivered it with about a much believability and passion a you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the camera all day . Even if the poor kid had any acting skill , the scene is completely unbelievable . The little girl would n't even BE in the middle of the battlefield after hour of carnage -- surrounded by hundred of dead body , while she calmly stand there ! ! Natural instinct would had the kid screaming and terrified , running AWAY from the bloody carnage ! Are we Suppose to be Horrified or Laugh ... ? ! One particularly goofy detail , that give the scene an SNL satire tone , is the father hanging , with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek . He look like a fish on a hook ! The unintentionally funny detail , make the whole scene come across a fake and silly . In Fantasy La-La-Land , Mothers and Daughters are the Same Age ! Another funny detail , is that you see a central character -- the little girl 's mother -- at the end of the scene and in the next scene , that occurs 20+ year later , she look exactly the same ! She is still young and beautiful , and now the same age a her daughter ! I almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful -- but I tried to stick it out because I wanted to see the Louisiana setting and I like all the actor . I do n't know what these fine actor were thinking when they accepted these role ! Who wa the Targeted Audience ? The excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows . It is also a strange way to start a movie that , for the rest of the time , seems targeted to romance novel reading female . Weird inconsistency in tone !",0
"I now that these day , some people wa n't see a movie without movie styling , so much Dogma , Lars Von , Watchosky Brothers , are changed what we expect in a movie , perhaps , Casomai is no-one-more-Independent-non-american movie , the movie take all movie resource and language to tell u a simple history about love and marriage , but much more .. Fully of view , lecture and let you thinking ... and I 'm sure , you ca n't fell boried any second of a long 116 minute . I calculate that do n't have a single scene longer that 3 o 2 1/2 minute .",1
"Okay . I really tried to tap into the ( so called ) silly & surreal humor that this film set out to be . I 'm told that the Japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to America ( go figure ! ) , and ha le political reference . Apart from all that , I found this sexual/political farce just a boring and pointless a standard porn . The central female lead is easy on the eye , and could actually act . I would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscle ( and no , not the one you 're thinking of ) . It 's obvious that Japan can ( and doe ) produce just a much crap a other country . I could n't recommend this to anyone , with the distant possibility of someone who ha a Jones for Asian porn . Go see a real Japanese film .",0
"Australian Fred Schepisi ( A Cry in the Dark ) directs this comedy/ romance that is fun , relaxing , and set in the spring . You will laugh while watching this movie . Tim Robbins ( Shawshank Redemption , Dead Man Walking ) is an auto mechanic , Ed Walters , with a high IQ , which get higher with the help of Albert Einstein , Walter Matthau ( Grumpy Old Men ) and his academic friend Nathan , Kurt and Boris . You can tell them by their preppie shoe . Meg Ryan ( Sleepless in Seattle , You 've Got Mail ) is Catherine Boyd , Einstein 's niece who is a competent , but not so confident mathematician . Perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius . She think that if she marries someone with a high I.Q . her kid will have a high I.Q . a well , but she doe not know what she want . Between Tim Robbins cute smile and Meg 's cuteness this is a refreshing movie . I love sweet story . People all age should enjoy this movie . Catherine is engaged to the jerk James Moreland , who work in animal behavior , but is very stuffy . This is a love a first sight type situation , between the mechanic and the mathematician . Witty line and subliminal line ! The cinematography is nice . Princeton , New Jersey is beautiful in the Spring . With much help from all those brilliant men Catherine fall for Ed , without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic . Favorite Scenes : Ed taking a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein , Nathan , Kurt , and Boris . Ed and Einstein riding on the motorcycle . Nathan , Kurt and Boris letting all the research animal free ! Favorite Quotes : Albert Einstein : `` Do n't let your brain interfere with your heart '' . Ed Walters : `` When wa the last time he said `` Wahoo '' '' ? Catherine Boyd : `` Well I 'm sure I do n't know '' . This is a refreshing movie , I recommend it . I have the tape and every once and awhile I will watch it again .",1
"This one is a great one ! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film . This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacle he faced in attaining his certification at the hand of a racist Master diver . Along the way , he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmate , none of whom want him in their class . They move out of the barrack when he arrives . Ultimately , he becomes certified and go on to have a great career a a US Navy diver . Watch this one ! It 's a great tale of courage and honor . As the story unfolds , we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begin to respect men one at a time .",1
"I do n't really consider myself a conservative , so I wa n't personally offended by this film , but it wa pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message . And the message is that all conservative are either evil or stupid ( or both ) . The character are one-dimensional -- either good , freedom-loving Americans , or brainless , greedy , evil conservative . There 's nothing clever or creative , just anti-conservative . I do n't really mind the political bias itself , but it should n't be the only purpose behind the movie . And clearly it is . On the positive side , the cast is wonderful and Chris Cooper 's impression of W is funny the first two or three time , but after that it 's just the same old joke being told over and over again . So if you really hate the conservative , you 'll probably enjoy this film , but if you 're looking for something with realistic character and a story that 's le black-and-white , then you 'd be better off watching something else .",0
"This is really good . Original idea in the film and a great terrorist action film . Only second to die hard and die hard with a vengeance , this film ha suspense and a good plot . I would recommend it to anyone with a taste in film like mine ; Action , terrorism and gangster/mafia .",1
Rajkumar Santoshi Without Any Doubt Has Directed The Greatest Movies And Biggest Box Office Hits Of Indian Cinema .

In The Later Part Of The Movie You Can Make Out That Amitabh Bachchan 's Voice Has Been Dubbed By Some Other Person Which Was Due To His Illness . Still The Movie Did'nt Had Proper Character Development Plus Cinematography Was'nt Good Too And One Thing That Bollywood Should Learn Is That They Should Use Visual Effects Only When It Is Needed And When Applied Should Be Done With A High Budget.The Script Had So Many Flaws Which Gives The Viewer Excuses To Attend His Phone Calls Rather Than Watching The Movie .

"A poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue . The anti-hero , The Man build a contraption to escape a band of marauder , out of the wastland of what wa once a civilization , to the ruin of the city to scavenge for his survival . There he cross pathes with The Brute , brilliantly played by Jean Reno , of `` The Professional '' and `` Mission : Impossible '' fame . The Man is rescued by a crazy old genius who life in a fortress of his own design . By using their wit , The Man and the old genius are able to keep the Brute and his ilk at bay , but they realise it is only a matter of time before their defense are compromised , so they make a break for it . This is a strongly understated tale of the desparate struggle for life , with excellent action scene and clever humor . Of all of the movie of it kind , like `` Road Warrior '' , `` Omega Man '' , and even `` Ultimate Warrior '' ( featuring Yul Brenner a a buff knife-fighter ) , `` Le Dernier Combat '' is the most artfully crafted . Copies of the video are hard-to-find , I would give my left eye ball for one . If your local art house ever ha a revival of this film , I heartily recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big .",1
"It 's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strike . And none more so that September 11 , 2001 , a date which changed the entire global landscape in it fight against terrorism . No , this documentary did n't set out to be dwelling on the event leading to 9/11 . Rather , the filmmaker , brother Gédéon and Jules Naudet , set out to do a documentary on the trial and tribulation of a rookie New York firefighter . They had gone to the academy and done some shoot of training , and had handpicked their `` proby '' ( probation firefighter ) to join them in an NY firehouse , home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7 . But their production wa to develop and contain at that time , believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center . I wa traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming , and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad , who informed me of the above . Few minute later , he told me there wa another , and that the WTC wa under attack . By the time I arrived home , the upper floor of the twin tower were ablaze and in smoke , and to my horror , they collapsed , under an hour . The filmmaker had two camera running that day , one who had followed a team out on a routine call , and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it . We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of event in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responder of firefighter , paramedic , and police had to make sense of what happened , and to quickly develop a plan of action . The other camera , held by the other brother , wa making his way to WTC to look for his sibling , and along the journey , captured the many expression of New Yorkers , a well a the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten . Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interview with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7 , which miraculously , did not suffer any casualty . But being survivor also brought about it own set of psychological turmoil , a they struggle to come to term with the event . Through the event that unfold , we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their job , to save life . We began with what the documentary wa supposed to be , before event of the day totally swung in and became the focus , right up to the rescue phase where hope of finding survivor under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structure . It 's not a film that is fabricated , and what you see here can not be recreated in any other documentary ( and heaven , not sound stage for Hollywood blockbuster ) . It 's a close a you can get to that day , witnessing the event up close , from safety . Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 set of interview with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7 .",1
"Oh , my . Oh , this is a * really * bad movie . The acting is absolutely atrocious , the script is god-awful , and the photography is simply dreadful . What doe make this movie stand out , however , is that you never once care about a single soul -- good guy or bad guy , living , dying or dead -- in the entire 87 minute . `` Oh , s/he died ? Huh ... Figured they would '' wa the best reaction I could muster after each murder . Characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off , you could still figure out who wa who . While the cast 's voice had an odd monotone quality throughout , their face give the impression that you 're looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling , exaggerated frown and `` pensive look '' . Each character is a humorless , passionless , one-dimensional one-trick pony ; once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation , they are summarily dismissed . It vaguely made me think of what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen ( director/writer of `` Skyggen '' , American title : `` Webmaster '' ) decided to do a low-budget version of `` American Psycho '' and got kind of distracted along the way . This is n't a particularly gruesome movie ; the cold , passionless cast ensures that . It is n't an offensive movie ; the director play it so safe that no one could possibly find it so . It is , simply and after all , a bad movie . Avoid it . We were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on Pay-per-View . As part of my penance , I 'm writing this review . Enough said .",0
"I wa in my mid teen when I saw this movie , and I wa struck by the beauty of the young star a well a the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story . It amazes me to learn that Alvina ha recently died , that Bury apparently ha not worked in the film business for almost 30 year , and that both would be in their 50 . The Elton John soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and support the air of protected innocence the character experience in seclusion . I have seen the movie poster , billing it a `` Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment , '' which apparently mean something like `` Two Children Who Like Each Other '' -- the English language distributor were wise to abbreviate the title ! Paul , the ignored 15-year-old son of an English businessman living in Paris , meet Michelle , an orphan , at the zoo . The two take what they intend a a day-long holiday to Michelle 's late father 's rural cottage , but end up staying there for a year , isolated from the outside world . They fall in love , Michelle get pregnant , and they have the baby alone at home . After the baby 's birth , the police come to Paul 's work place and take him away . `` Blue Lagoon '' come to mind a another film that almost capture the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise . So sad that `` Friends '' ha never been released on DVD .",1
"When Braveheart first came out , I wa enthralled , and wa admittedly one of the most rabid fan of the film . When Rob Roy came out , I wa intrigued , and although I enjoyed the film I did not think it wa a great film . However , a time ha gone by , my appreciation for Rob Roy ha grown , and my enthusiasm for Braveheart ha diminished . Braveheart is great entertainment , to be sure , but there are flaw a well . The most significant , in my view , is the unflattering portrayal of Robert the Bruce , who wa without a doubt Scotland 's greatest king . Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film , which tarnish the film in proportion to the many historical distortion . I think I am also bothered by the fact that it wa in this film , seen only ( at least by me ) in retrospect , that the beginning of Mel Gibson 's egomania can be seen clearly for the first time . In contrast , Rob Roy ha grown on me over the year . Partly because it largely avoids the fault I mind most in Braveheart . But also because Rob Roy is like fine wine , growing more mature and complex with each viewing .",1
"The French either make pro-Marxist film or anti-Marxist film - with a few in between . `` Merci pour le chocolat '' is the latter of this genre . From the opening credit telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it wa who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension . It is an old man 's film with an excess of 40 's plus people . It is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer . The plot is not only banal but preposterous . How many film reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minute later ? Maybe the director and actor had a low retentive capacity ? In truth their is no tenable plot at all . It is riddle with hole like a good piece of French cheese . Whether intentional or not , it is a film about the bourgeoisie . At least a third of the film focus on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene . I concede it ha some well framed shot though they could n't have used a steady-cam in this film - it would have woke them all up ! Other than it being a nonsense story , the film allows the upper middle class to parade their value and vanity in a very comfortable Swiss location . A telling line of the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tell Anna Mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort ! Oh dear me . On the DVD , Miss Huppert make a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene . Smirking she say : `` Like they do in the American Actor 's Studio ! '' I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the Actor 's Studio . If there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when Huppert remark 'we are having friend for the weekend and all the servant are away ' . No doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film . Safety Medical Note . In the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage . This should never be done . Only cold water should be used . Minus 10 mark .",0
"A gem of a British caper-comedy . Poor American schlub Pinky Green ( Richard Jordan , playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one ) get out of a British jail and try to go straight , but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friend , headed up by a really nasty Ivan ( David Niven in one of his last role ) . Pinky resists , but the lure of all that money is just too much for him . Things unravel and reravel and it 's all joyous to watch . Jordan must have played 20 bad guy in his career , but he never played the same one twice - this one is just too lovable to hate . Niven never played a slicker bad guy , oil all over . Two fine actor we 've lost that I wish we had back .",1
"How this ha not become a cult film I do not know . I think it ha been sadly overlooked a a truly ingenious comedy ! `` Runaway Car '' attempt to pas itself off a a fast-paced thriller , but taking the quality of acting ( good God it 's bad ) , the storyline , the practicality of the car 's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh . And laugh you will . Films are made to entertain u , and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film 's worth . This film is the pinnacle in entertainment , I laughed from beginning to end . At one point I got short of breath and nearly choked , it really is that funny at some point . When the baby wa airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook did n't rip the car roof to piece , I wa laughing hysterically . But when the baby starting swinging around in the air , nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree , tear were running down my face . It also occurred to me that the black cop wa the guy who played Jesus in Madonna 's `` Like A Prayer '' video . He seems to get everywhere .",1
"Skullduggery is a strange , strange film based on the novel `` Ye Shall Know Them '' by Vercors . To unleash criticism at the film feel really unkind , since it is a movie that deal with earnest theme like humanity , and plea for upright moral standard and tolerance . But in spite of it honourable intention and it well-meaning tone , Skullduggery simply is n't a very good film . For me , the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which ca n't make it mind up how best to convey it message . The first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the Tarzan ilk ; later it teeter into sci-fi fable ; by the end it slip into courtroom melodramatics . The difference in tone between each section of the movie are too great , too jarring , to overlook . They stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you 're watching a muddled , disorganised movie . An archaeological expedition into the jungle of New Guinea is led by adventurer Douglas Temple ( Burt Reynolds ) . One of the main archaeologist involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist Dr Sybil Greame ( Susan Clark ) . After an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape-like creature . These primitive , long-lost people are covered in hair and have survived for century without being in any way touched or influenced by the development of modern man . There is some evidence that they may the ancestor of early man  the `` missing link '' in the evolution of ape into human . Or perhaps a race of human who simply look and behave differently from usual ? Or even a race of animal that have begun to develop human characteristic ? The archaeologist call the tribe `` the Tropi '' and are initially thrilled by the implication of their discovery . But thing take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist Vancruysen ( Paul Hubschmid ) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developer . He question whether the Tropi are truly `` human '' and take his argument to the court , where he hope to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambition can be continued . This wa a very early film in Reynolds ' career , and he actually unbalance this movie by acting like he 's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously . Not that Reynolds can be blamed  he ha an impossible role , asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a Tarzan flick . His character and the film are not relevant to each other . Clark fare much better a the earnest lady archaeologist , and there are nice supporting role for British actor Edward Fox , Alexander Knox and Wilfrid Hyde-White . A major shortcoming in Skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make-up used to give the Tropi their strange hairy appearance . Rather than making the actor look like believable hominoid , the stuck-on hair merely make them look unintentionally comical . and that 's just not the right idea . We 're meant to feel great sympathy for these creature , but that 's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing . Skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant , philosophical and stimulating . The honourable intention are there for all to see , but the end result doe n't do them justice . A worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless .",0
"Why is it that in the '50s and '60s , Italians made so of the best movie , and then during the '70s and '80s , made nothing but zombie and cannibal movie ? Probably because art film did n't make any money . , The Cannibal Movie , unlike the Zombie Movie , which wa created by Americans and ` exploited ' by Italians , is a purely Italian creation , designed a a mondo exploitation showcase , and to make a much money a possible ( no artistic integrity getting in the way here ) . Eaten Alive came during the Cannibal Movie heyday . The director , Umberto Lenzi , had n't even hit his stride yet ; his genre classic , Cannibal Ferox , wa still a year away . In plotting similar to ( read : ripped off from ) Ruggero Deodato 's seminal cannibal classic , Cannibal Holocaust , a woman ( Janet Agren ) receives word from the police that they 've received a 8mm film from her sister . She 's gone missing in Africa , and it 's suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it . Mel Ferrer , a a Professor of Somethingoranother , tell her that a man named Jonas ( Ivan Rassimov ) ha started a Jonestown-like cult in New Guinea , and that 's where the sister is . The woman hire a guide ( Robert Kerman ) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister . And , would n't you know it , the jungle is full of cannibal . One sentence should sum it up : if you 've seen on Cannibal Movie , you 've seen them all , mostly because these film steal shamelessly from each other ( Lenzi copied Cannibal Holocaust to make this film , and retooled this to make Cannibal Ferox ; Deodato copied part of this for Hit and Run ) . And because they all share the same material , they all feature the same trait : awful photography , boring scenery , terrible dubbing , overacting , and exploitation , exploitation , exploitation . Genre fan will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran . Rassimov and Kerman have a scenery eating contest . Agren exists solely to be naked , raped , or in peril . Plenty o ' gore for all the sickos out there . The cannibal , who do actually appear to be native cannibal , eat lunch met disguised a human flesh . And , in the grand tradition of Cannibal Movies , any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter . Overall , really not a good experience , but I 'm sure there are psychopath out there who find this excrement entertaining . I know I did .",0
"One of the most magnificent movie ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known a Bronson ) is simply outstanding . This is the crown on the career of director Winner , who himself wa often quoted saying this wa his masterpiece . The plot ha been copied many time , but it 's never been topped . Wildey J. Moore , the gun manufacturer , many time claimed his brand 's growth since the mid 80 can be fully credited to DW3 , and rightly so . This is not just a movie , this is art that many generation will admire and appreciate . Although this movie ha never been fully appreciated in the USA , it ha found a huge following in Europe and Asia , where the movie is regularly shown at film school and it is still a popular hit in student cinema all across Europe . All in all , a true classic .",1
"I just caught `` Wild Rebels '' on one of the `` Mystery Science Theatre 3000 '' archive compilation , and this movie wa so bad even the MST3K crew could n't make it entertaining . There are some MST3K `` target '' that were film whose concept were so dippy they could n't possibly have been good movie ( like `` The Green Slime '' ) , and others whose basic premise could have been made into genuinely entertaining film if their filmmaker had n't bobbled them in the execution . `` Wild Rebels '' is a film whose basic premise DID make a good movie three year earlier , when Don Siegel directed his remake of `` The Killers '' at Universal . Both film are about a failed racing driver who 's seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the woman 's boyfriend -- only in `` The Killers '' the driver wa John Cassavetes , the woman wa Angie Dickinson and the criminal mastermind ( cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film ) wa Ronald Reagan . Steve Alaimo , Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are quite a comedown ! But what REALLY make `` Wild Rebels '' an awful movie is the direction by William Grefé ( note the accent over the final `` e , '' present in his on-screen credit ) , which ha absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again a long a it need to to make it dramatic point . It 's only a pity that someone did n't do a mocking commentary on this movie now ( in 2009 ) ; the comparison between Steve Alaimo 's hairdo and Rod Blagojevich 's would have been irresistible !",0
"Spoilers : This movie ha it 's problem , but in the end it get the message across . I liked it because it end the way thing really do . The nice guy try and try , get his heart broken several time , but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending . It end the way such thing always end , or at least always have in my own and friend ' experience . Anyone who think that the ending to this is n't how it really happens , a the first comment seemed to , believing that the girl would come around , realize she 's dating an asshole who treat her bad because he doe n't care about her at all is either naive or life in a more perfect world than I. I give it 7/10 , extra point simply because it wa n't afraid to end on a down note , give no real resolution , just the main character left heartbroken , confused and alone a so many men of countless generation have been before .",1
"Thirty per cent of this movie appears to be the prototype for the Map Channel . You see a giant map for about ten minute , then they unleash the stock footage big time while droning ( droning , get it ? ) on about radar . Apparently there 's a lot of radar station in the far north , protecting North America 's border from attack by deadly polar bear . The bear never show up , but a giant Mantis doe . It wa frozen in the ice for over a million year or so , until it wa released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world ( yeah , right . For my money , it wa released by global warming ) . It is a huge prehistoric insect , and it need lot of food . Since there are n't any cow in the frozen north , it decides to feast on the most bovine-like creature it can find up there . I.E. , human being . It start attacking radar station , probably because the humming from the radar dish wa getting on it nerve . Enter Col. Joe Parkman , the resident smarmy guy of the film . He 's investigating a plane that went down , and is puzzled why there are no body in the wreckage . The only thing he find is one of the claw of the Mantis . Apparently it decided to trim it nail while it wa snacking on the plane 's crew . Parkman take the claw tip back with him to be analyzed by a thousand year old scientist . Grandpa scientist ca n't make head or tail of the claw , mostly because he 's missed his nap so his mind is n't functioning too well . So he call in a smug paleontologist played by the guy who wa the P.I . in Perry Mason . He and his friend , a transvestite photographer , fly north because he 's decided that the claw must have come from a Praying Mantis . Just one the size of a commuter train . It 's Luke warm love at first sight when Col.Parkman first set eye on the she-male photographer . The men at the base , obviously having been deprived for many year , think she 's the hottest thing to come along since Granny Clampett . Smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path of the Mantis , which ha devastated some stock footage of an Eskimo village . It come to the base looking for an after dinner snack , and crush some cheap set quite effectively . Then it fly south and disappears . Now come the tense hour when the civilian ground observer core are called on to sweep the sky looking for anything large flying overhead . I doubt that in reality they would have been told that they were looking for a giant flying mantis that eats human being , since that would haver caused a panic . Probably they were told to look for a giant 727 that wa painted green and hummed because it engine wa out of tune . Col. Parkman go up in a plane to try to shoot the Mantis down , and botch the mission . The Mantis land in New York City , probably because it wanted to take in a show on Broadway or visit Sex World in Times Square . The army corner it in the Tunnel , and Parkman and his men don stupid suit that they borrowed from the Orkin Man to go in and try to blow the Mantis up . Success ! Well , almost , since the Mantis is still twitching enough that it almost kill the mannish Eve Arden photographer lady . There 's a tepid love scene at the end , and the paleontologist take a picture of the dead mantis because Colonel Hair Grease and Ms . Gender Unspecified are busy smooching . So kind of a nauseating ending .",0
"The Dereks did seem to struggle to find roll for Bo after `` 10 '' . I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys . One day , the script for `` Ghosts Ca n't Do It '' wa circulating among the trainer in the `` fish house '' where food wa prepared for the dolphin . There wa one scene where a -dolphin- supposedly proposition Bo ( or Bo the dolphin ) , asking to `` go make egg . '' Reading the script , we -lauuughed- ... We did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility , although our dolphin -were- in `` The Big Blue ! '' This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn 's life . I hope he had fun in this film , a it certainly did n't do anything for his legacy .",0
"Uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century Vienna mixing the story of six group of character by former documentary maker U.Seidl is a provocative , minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema . After the world-wide spread of Big Brother reality show , Hundstage take modern voyeurism to an unsettling , profound level . Hard to like but unignorable piece of European art-cinema might seem cruel and seedy , yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner . A must for lover of world cinema .",1
"This is not a GREAT movie a tho the cast ( especially the kid ) admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with cliché upon cliché . Poor family in 50 's mid America , dying mother , alcoholic father , 10 child ( 1 of whom ha epilepsy ) and an awful decision to be made . Its very easy to watch and some of the kid performance are moving without being sickly or naff . And little Frank and Warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me bawling no matter how many time I see it . A great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all . Only those with the hardest of heart could fail to be moved by it . Not on a par to Sophies Choice but a good TV movie equivalent ! ! !",1
"I really hated this movie and it 's the first movie written by Stephen King that I did n't finish . I wa truly disappointed , it wa the worst crap I 've ever seen . What were you thinking making three hour out of it ? It may have a quite good story , but actor ? No . Suspense ? No . Romance ? No . Horror ? No . It did n't have anything . It 's got this strange , crazy science man with Einstein-hair , the classic thing . Not real at all . And a man keep getting younger all the time . It seems like they just used the name of Stephen King to make a crappy , too long movie with nothing exciting at all . I give this movie `` 1 ( awful ) '' . If they had like -5 , I would probably take that instead . It wa a total waste of time .",0
"This is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s . However , if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot , it doe n't seem to have aged very well . Long story short : extremely drawn out , slow-moving , confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography , typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sound with every punch and kick , and constant `` plot twist '' that never come to an end . By the time the film reach it emotional climax , I had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care . Watch it for it historical value a a milestone of Chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectation at the door , or you 'll be bitterly disappointed . For hardcore fan only .",0
"This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hit . When I got Agent Under Fire , I thought that wa a good game but then Nightfire came around and that wa better , but now there is a new type of James Bond game . This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 mission , the graphic of the game are out of this house . It even ha all of the great actor and actress in this game like Pierce Bronsan a once again James Bond , William Dafoe a the villain Nikolai Diavolo , and Judi Dench a M ( forgive me all if I spell it wrong ) . This game would be own a the greatest James Bond game around . I give this a 10/10",1
"The unflappable William Powell . He is a joy to watch on the screen a he make his way through situation without a care in the world . He always seems on top of his game and show little care for anyone who doubt him . The murder are project , barely human being . I have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit . Other than an occasional weeping widow , the victim fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists . Nothing more . There are enough twist and turn to keep thing interesting along the way and Powell is a master at this . There is a lot of political incorrectness , especially a it relates to the Asian performer . This is a little hard to take . The cast is great , and Curtiz 's direction is also a consistent asset .",1
"What we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80 's incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash- cinema completely speechless ! `` Wizards of the Lost Kingdom '' is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy/Sword-and-Sorcery adventure that doe n't have an actual plot but doe eagerly & shamelessly borrows element from other film . Writer Ed Naha and Hector Olivera ( who ? ) watched enough similar type of movie to know that they needed a handful of essential character , but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically . In order to make a fantasy-adventure you need : one super- evil villain ( preferably with a black cape ) , one young hero in training , one lone warrior , one amiable type of furry pet , one wise midget living in the wood ( optional ) and a whole colorful collection of hideous demon , enslaved dwarf , and winged gargoyle to serve a filler . The story is phenomenal and so original , with Simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician Shurka take over the power and killed the king . Simon want to go back and save the people , but therefore he need his powerful ring which he lost during his escape . Simon befriends lone warrior Kor ( the usually cool dude Bo Svenson who clearly needed the pay check ) , who assist Simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeal , dangerous encounter and magical showdown . Admittedly it doe n't even sound too bad thus far , but that 's merely just because I excluded all the deliciously inept little detail . Simon ha a best friend named Gulfax , for example . Gulfax is an albino version of Chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckle whenever he open his poodle-snout to yelp something incomprehensible . The obstacle during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the `` plot '' and simply serve a padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content . Simon ha nightmarish vision inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph , Kor settle an old score with the pig-faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there 's the supposedly horrible 'suicide cave ' where you can only sing your way out of . But the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence  not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema  involves the resurrection of four zombie warrior . Simon awakes the legendary courageous warrior , hoping they will assist them in their battle , but the rotting corps only take a few step , complain about how tired they are and return back to their graf . That 's it ! So much for the zombie sub plot ! Best sequence ever ! I could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little detail for several more paragraph , but you get the idea . `` Wizards of the Lost Kingdom '' is a tremendously messed-up `` so-bad-it's-good '' film . Word of advice : do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone . Invite friend , preferably the dope-headed type with a wicked sense of humor , and watch it in group . It will be a night to remember",0
"This is one of my favourite film , dating back to my childhood . Set in the remote wilderness of Siberia at the turn of the century , a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter force two tiger to come down from the mountain in search of food , preying on outlying farm . In this atmosphere we are introduced to Avakum , a hermit fur trapper , who life out in the wild , a he come to the village to sell his annual catch to Boris , his close , and rather only , friend in the village , who run a store . At Boris ' request , Avakum accompanies his friend 's arrogant son , Ivan , on the hunt for the menacing tiger . Personalities crash and temper flare a the older , more experienced Avakum criticises Ivan 's amateur method , an encounter noticed also by the other member of the hunt . On the second day , the hunter sight their prey and give chase . In a thick wood , Ivan wound one of the tiger , which then attack the hapless man . Avakum , seeing Ivan tangling with the enraged beast , fire , but accidently hit Ivan . He kill the tiger a it flees . The other hunter arrive on the scene , suspicious . Back in the village , the doctor work to save the wounded Ivan . Avakum attempt to leave the village , but is confronted by Ivan 's friend . The trapper brush them off however , and speed off with his dog-drawn sled . The young villager swear after him that they 'll come for him if Ivan dy , which he later doe , but before dying explains to his father that it wa an accident . Old Boris , upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village , straightens out the gathering `` lynch mob '' and go out after Avakum , to find him and set thing right . And so the main story begin . A simple film , it raise the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature , mainly Avakum 's struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness . The winter landscape is very well filmed . Perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by Jimmie Haskell . Very sentimental and evocative , the main theme reminiscent of Albinoni 's Adagio . Other movement reflect Russian style , a well a a couple of folk music type tune . Unfortunately , this film is not available to buy , to my knowledge , which is rather a shame . The copy I own , recorded off TV nearly twenty year ago is slowly deteriorating . This film is a must see for those who can appreciate it , if they can find it . 8/10",1
"I have a feeling that the Warners Bros Depression-era musical are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of year . Yes , we are in the economic doldrums ( or have you been living under a rock ) and time look bleak . But we always have the movie a a way to escape our trouble . In the 30 's , film-going wa hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom . `` Footlight Parade ( 1933 ) '' wa one such film that audience flocked to . While this Lloyd Bacon-directed musical doe n't quite capture the social issue of the time a `` Gold Diggers of 1933 ( 1933 ) '' doe , it 's still a wonderful showcase of talent . We have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece Busby Berkely extravaganza number , but boy , are they worth waiting for me . Yes , little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress , and her tapping is so-so , but Busby 's magical `` By A Waterfall '' whisk her , and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girl , into a dizzying water wonderland . Of course Busby 's number could never really be performed on a stage ( they defy limit of gravity , for one thing ) , and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough , wisecracking non-musical scene . And `` Footlight '' also ha James Cagney in at the one of his all-too-few musical ( really , what could n't this man do ? ) . He even get to take over from the leading man , don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot Shanghai Lil ( who is really little Ruby in China-girl wig ! ) .He co-star with Joan Blondell , his adorable , adoring secretary who Cagney somehow overlook in favour of other woman ( until the final reel , that is ) . Apparently Blondell wa the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife . And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene .",1
"This is a novelty in Danish film . The mood is not unlike that of Blinkende Lygter , also by Anders Thomas Jensen , but with a novel touch . One difference is fewer character , leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into . And what character ? ! The two butcher are perfect . Mads Mikkelsen is a dominating , deranged parody and Nikolaj Lie Kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or le an unholy pairing of the two .",1
"First of all this is one of the worst soft-core straight to cable `` erotic thriller '' I 've ever seen in my life . Of course , like all erotic thriller are want to do , it 's about a brothel madam and is set in a brothel . This , of course , make the softcore simulated sex that pop up every other 10 minute seem `` in context . '' Whatever . Forget for one moment that this wa never meant to win any award . The actor are terrible and their line reading made me cringe . The woman who play the female cop is so bad it 's beyond description . She must be a really REALLY good friend of the guy who put up the movie for this terrible adventure , if you know what I mean . The production value are only slightly higher than porn . Other than that ? I suppose if you 're really drunk and you need something to laugh at , this would be a perfect film . And if that 's the case , I recommend fast forwarding to all the scene with the female cop . What 's that accent , Brooklyn ? Hilarious !",0
"Beforehand Notification : I 'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here , but when I saw the preview for this movie , I wa thinking `` Finally ! '' I have yet to see one movie about popular African-influenced dance ( be it popular hip hop move , breaking , or stepping ) where the main character wa a Black woman . I 've seen an excessive amount of movie where a non-Black woman who knew nothing about hip hop come fresh to the hood and doe a mediocre job of it ( Breakin , Breakin 2 , Save the Last Dance , Step Up ) , but the Black woman in the film are almost nonexistent . That always bothered me considering so much of hip hop , African-influenced dance , and breaking wa with Blacks and Latinos in massive amount in these particular set and it wa n't always men who performed it , so I felt this movie ha been a long time coming . However , the race doe not make the film , so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot ; the dancing be entertaining ; and interesting to watch . Pros : I really enjoyed this film bringing Jamaican culture . I ca n't recall ever seeing a popular , mainstream film where all the main character were Jamaican ; had believable accent ; and were n't stereotypical with the beany . The stepper , family , friend , and even the `` thug '' were all really intelligent , realistic people who were trying to love , live , and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive . Even when the audience wa made aware that the main character 's sister chose an alternate lifestyle , it still did n't make the plot stereotypical . I wa satisfied with the way it wa portrayed . I LOVED the stepping ; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two stepper ; the trial that the main character 's parent were going through ; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with Crabs in a Barrel . I respected that she wa so intelligent and active at the same time , and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world . They were all just a excellent a the fella . I do n't see that in too many movie nowadays , at least not those that would be considered Black film . Cons : I 'm not quite sure why the director or whoever put the movie together did this , but I question whether they 've been to real step show . Whenever the stepper got ready to perform , some hip hop song would play in place of the stepper ' hand/feet beat . At a real step show , there is zero need for music , other than to maybe entertain the crowd in between group . And then when hip hop song were played , sometimes the beat to the song wa off to the beat of the stepper ' hand and foot . It wa awkward . I wa more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus `` Stomp the Yard '' ( another great stepping movie ) because the woman got to represent a fierce a the guy ( in `` Stomp the Yard , '' Meagan Good got all of a few second of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the ( Deltas ? ) let out a chant and a few step and were cut immediately ) . Even when there were very small scene , the lady tore it up , especially in the auto shop , and it wa without all that music to drown out their physical music . I know soundtrack have to be sold , but the movie folk could 've played the music in other part of the film . I 'm not a Keyshia Cole fan , so every time I saw her , all I kept thinking wa `` Is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talk ? '' She looked uncomfortable on screen to me . I thought they should 've used a host like Free or Rocsi instead . Deray Davis wa funny a usual though . Also , I groaned when I found out that the movie wa supposed to be in the ghetto , like stepping could n't possibly happen anywhere else . Hollywood , a usual . However , only a couple of people were portrayed a excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and loser , which mainstream movie tend to do . I would 've given this movie five star , but the music playing killed it for me . I definitely plan to buy it when it come out and hopefully the bonus scene will include the actual step show without all the song .",1
"It 's the worst movie I 've ever seen . The action is so unclear , work of camera is so poor , actor are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minute of Arnie on the screen . My advice from the bottom of my heart - do n't watch it unless you like such a low class torture .",0
Excellent writing and wild cast . The tech is poor but it 's obviously very low budget . Looks like they did n't cut the negative but had to release on a video output . In any case one of the most inventive comedy I 've seen lately . The screenwriter in particular is fine .,1
"Contains Major Spoilers , on the off chance you would actually care about the story line . OK , we have storm that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobber the power grid . Predictable schlock from the start , and if that were n't enough , the 5 second action bump between the movie and the commercial kill what little suspense there might have been . For example : will they make it to the airport in time ? Things look dim a we go to a commercial and the action shot before the ad show them bouncing around inside the plane ! Well , I guess they 're gon na make it after all but then again , they had to because they 're good guy . The acting wa n't any too impressive ( exception and welcome relief : Randy Quaid a Tornado Tommy ) , the effect were kinda lame , the bad guy got it , and the good guy came through . The real disaster of this movie wa the script , especially the ending . Not only did they wrap thing up happily a quickly a a soap opera given 24 hour notice of a cancellation , but they glorified the hacker a well-intentioned . So he caused a bazillion death he meant well . And , of course , an uplifting final TV report about people coming together . Barf . It wa everything I expected from the commercial , and I 'm glad I wasted my time watching it . It will make great conversation at the lunch table tomorrow . Is CBS insulting u by making this ? Sure but we watched it , did n't we ? Did you count many ad there were for home backup generator during this pig ? Here 's hoping for the next Plan 9 from Outer Space ( which get better with each viewing ) . This is n't it . 1 star .",0
"Another Indian legend you never heard of before is let loose . As the name implies , this is a vengeful wraith who like to absorb the skeleton of people while they 're still using them . As usual , ancient burial ground ( can you say , `` Poltergeist ? '' ) have been disturbed by clichéd greedy land developer building stuff . The CGI , if it had been better , might have made the effect more treacherous looking , but they skimped on the budget , and it show -- to comical effect . The unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during it first several killings-that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere-but the inept director decided to show u in the first five minute what it look like , and it wa n't impressive . The death are just poorly done , again with shoddy CGI . I guess ancient spirit always kill by using cheap special effect . As for the `` victim , '' they look they 're going to laugh any moment while they do goofy scream . It 's always obvious who 's going to get it : a character with only a few line show up , strange noise are heard , CGI dot fly , exit character . Repeat ( several time ) . Still , there 's a few chase scene featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable . Unfortunately , the director seems to be using these a a device to fall back on ( so it 's used too often ) when he ca n't think of anything else for his character to do . Overall , it 's pretty silly , but I 've seen worse . This flick is cheap , but it 's oddly fun to watch .",0
"When I really began to be interested in movie , at the age of eleven , I had a big list of 'must see ' film and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend ; some of them were not for all audience and my mother would go nut . I remember one of the film on that list wa `` A Chorus Line '' and could never get it ; so now to see it is a dream come true . Of course , I lost the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting thing to watch there . I mean , take `` A Chorus Line '' , a stage play turned into film . I know it 's something we see a lot nowadays , but back then it wa a little different , apparently ; and this film ha something special . Most of the musical made movie today , take the chance the camera give them for free , to create different scenery and take the character to different place ; `` A Chorus Line '' wa born on a theater stage a a play and it dy in the same place a a movie . Following a big audition held by recognized choreographer Zach ( Michael Douglas ) , Richard Atenborough directs a big number of dancer a they try to get the job . Everything happens on the same day : the tension of not knowing , the stress of having to learn the number , the silent competition between the dancer And it all occurs on the stage , where Douglas put each dancer on the spotlight and make them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experience . There are hundred of dancer and they are all fantastic , but they list shortens a the hour go by . Like a movie I saw recently , `` A Prairie Home Companion '' , the broadcast of a radio show , Atenborough here deal with the problem of continuity . On or behind the stage , thing are going on , and time doe n't seem to stop . Again , I do n't if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot this , but it sure doe n't look like it ; and anyway it 's a great directing and editing ( John Bloom ) work . But in that little stage , what you wonder is what to do with the camera With only one setting , Ronnie Taylor 's cinematography find the way , making close-ups to certain character , zooming in and out , showing the stage from different perspective and also giving u a beautiful view of New York . In one crucial moment , Douglas tell the one that are left : `` Before we start eliminating : you 're all terrific and I 'd like to hire you all ; but I ca n't '' . This made me think about reality show today , where the only thing that count is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always say that exact word to the contestant before some of them are leaving ( even when they are not good ) . It 's hard , you must imagine ; at least here , where all of them really are terrific . To tell some of the story , the character use song and , in one second , the stage take a new life and it literally is ' a dream come true ' . The music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyric by Edward Kleban make the theater to film transition without flaw , showing these dancer ' feeling and letting them do those wonderful choreography by Michael Bennett . The book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman ; which is very touching at time . So if it 's not with a song it will be with a word ; but in `` A Chorus Line '' , it 's impossible not to be moved . During one of the rehearsal break in the audition , Cassie , a special dancer played by Alyson Reed , take the stage to convince Douglas character that she can do it . The word `` let me dance for you '' never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyric .",1
"The movie follows the event of the novel `` Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni '' ( could be translated a `` The most beloved among human '' ) , written by Marin Preda ( a very controversial book and movie ) , a novel which became something like The Bible or the story of Hamlet , very popular and hard to get , due to it satiric content over the Communist regime . It represents the drama of the intellectual man , the humanist , in a `` red '' world . A movie filled with passion , fear , sexuality , all the great ingredient for a great movie recipe.One of the greatest Romanian movie , despite it psychological charge ( after all , it is an European movie ) .",1
"If it were n't for the editing out of curse word and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger , it would be easy to mistake this low-budget snoozer for a Sci-Fi channel pilot . The plot about the government 's attempt to destroy a group of telekinetics it originally trained a military weapon end ambiguously enough with the hero , himself gifted , in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge . Alas , the movie is talky , boring , predictable and even devoid of interesting special effect . Top-billed Louis Gossett , Jr. ha a minor role a the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now want to eliminate all trace . He walk through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered . Other member of the cast do a decent job with a script that demand little .",0
"I have seen The Running Man several time a I am a Stephen King fan and have all his movie but now it is even better because up until 2 day ago I did n't know about this website and I did n't realize that the Paul Michael Glaser that wa involved with this movie wa the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grow up watching on Starsky and Hutch television show . For me this is a pleasant surprise because I ca n't tell you how many time I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt . The episode where Starsky ( Kill Starsky ) almost died I cried so hard My dad had to turn away from the show . What to you expect of a kid at age 12 .

"A stuttering plot , uninteresting character and sub-par ( to say the least ) dialogue plague this TV production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget . The character are n't believable , in their motif , action or their professed occupation . The plot read like a bad Dungeons and Dragons ( TM ) hack but with plasma rifle and force field . There are severe continuity issue and the degree of pointless interaction between the character ha this author , at least , wincing . Avoid it like the plague .

"Yes , this movie is a real thief . It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politician wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance ( support ? ) for the war U.S. is still fighting today . I do not really want to go here into politics , but come on , this is more clear than the summer sky . Hurt locker doe not really have anything outstanding , no real plot at all . I really feel myself in the 50 's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like . The same propaganda movie were produced that time , only with the exception that those were black and white . Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the `` U.S. war are cool '' genre , you surely have much better movie to choose from .",0
"Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making , it 's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever . If you 're depressed already , this film will send you over the edge . If you 're feeling somewhat depressed , this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about . You 'll feel that it 's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turn out to be a complete waste of time . Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed ( I did n't , BTW ) , safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim 's . Then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself , and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you 'd previously realized . You might feel a bit annoyed at Jim for bringing this to your attention . You may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish . The sad truth is , much a I wanted to like this movie ... I hated it . It took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly , for no reason whatsoever , looked back at itself and then stopped . Jim doe not have an epiphany , at least not one that is conveyed on screen . Jim ha a miserable life and a miserable set of option . He discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery . Of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie . As others have said it 's no Hollywood tale , it 's gritty and it 's real . It 's well made . Life is quite a struggle at time . If anyone were to know `` the answer '' , they do well to shout it from the rooftop . Still , I feel cheated because this movie pretend to have something to say . You feel that it 's going to say something , that if you just suffer through a little more of it , it 'll have something to say . It 'll make you stop and think . It doe n't . Again , I do submit that this is a well crafted film . And therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g . lighting technique of the use of colour palette . For the rest of u , it 's utterly miss-able .",0
"I have to admit to enjoying bad movie . I love them I watch all of them . Horror especially . My friend and I all gather after a hard week at school and work , rent some crazy tape , order a pizza and have a blast . One of the one we got at Hollywood Video , wa this one , Zombie Bloodbath . This one had a great box , so I wa expecting le than usual . The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that ha had the above-ground layer bulldozed , and the other underground layer are simply covered up . The inhabitant of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kid fall into a hole inside a cave . This wake up some zombie . From this point on , it 's chunk-city . The gore effect and action never stop until the end credit roll . OK , it 's not great art , but this one , with it 's in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff wa our favorite of the evening . Actually , it wa one of the best `` party tape '' I have ever had the pleasure of watching . And you could tell it wa done on no money , with a bunch of crazy people . There are hundred of zombie , and the Director look like Brendan Frazer ( he ha a cameo ) and it is just a wild trip .",1

The Sultan ( Marc Zuber ) is a weak puppet ; his uncle , the Bashaw ( Vladek Sheybal ) , who is being manipulated by the French and Germans , is the real power behind the throne . Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli ( Sean Connery ) , the leader of the Rif tribe and `` the last of the Barbary Pirates '' , who kidnaps an American missionary , Eden Pedecaris ( Candice Bergen ) and her two child and take them hostage . Back in the US , President Theodore Roosevelt ( Brian Keith ) threatens to go to war over the issue : `` Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead ! '' - seeing the issue a the perfect way to exercise his `` Big Stick '' diplomacy , though Secretary of State John Hay ( John Huston ) is not so confident . However , the Raisuli ha le sinister plan for the Pedecarises , who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event . John Milius 's great historical film , based VERY loosely off of a true story ( i.e . Pedecaris wa a middle-aged man ) , is a wonderful bit of escapism . It ha some amazing action scene , a witty , well-written script , a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material , and doe not overstay it welcome like , say , `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' or the `` Lord of the Rings '' movie . It 's not really an `` epic '' film in the strictest sense , but it 's one of the best pure action movie ever made . While the historical context is shaky , the storyline is interesting , and a some reviewer point out , it is even more pertinent today than it wa when made . As President Roosevelt say , `` America is like a grizzly bear '' - fierce , strong , but a little blind and reckless at time . At the time of the film 's setting , America ha just been propelled onto the world stage a superpower , following their resounding victory in the Spanish-American War - and Roosevelt seizes this incident a a way to prove America 's worth . In real life , it did n't quite work out that way , but allegorically it work well . While written from a right-wing perspective , Milius 's screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing America and it place in the world . He admires Roosevelt and his method of `` big stick '' diplomacy , and correctly recognizes ( in the word of Roosevelt ) that while America may be feared and respected , they 'll never be truly `` loved '' by the world , no matter what they do . And there are some scene - like Roosevelt 's target shooting of European leader and the almost-comic surprise attack by Marines on the Bashaw 's palace - which show America 's reckless and violent side , while others - the climactic showdown with the Germans - show their heroism . The historical/political context of the film is , of course , merely meat on the bone of what is essentially a rousing action/adventure film . There are some brilliantly done action scene , such a Raisuli 's rescue of the Pedecaris 's from double-crossing tribesman , which feature some of the best swordplay in any film . The opening entrance of the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the US Marines are brilliantly done bravura set piece . And the final battle , which combine element of `` Lawrence of Arabia '' and `` The Wild Bunch '' , while a major historical fantasy ( a three-way battle between Germans , Americans , and the Rifs ) , is a superbly staged , adrenaline-pumping sequence . The excellent cast give some wonderful performance . Everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film , and it show . Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing a a Berber with a Scottish accent , but manages to pull off his interesting , well-drawn and chivalrous character who come to respect his hostage and abhors modern , uncivil warfare . Candice Bergen , an actress whom I 've never been fond of , give a fine performance a the feisty Eden Pedecaris , who is every bit a tough a her captor . Brian Keith is an amazingly convincing TR - you really feel he must have been like this , an athletic , blustering , yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self . The scene of Roosevelt boxing and target-shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest `` bad as '' moment in movie history - and who can forget line like `` Why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality ? '' John Huston provides solid support a the weary , cautious Hay , acting a a perfect foil to the much more impetuous Roosevelt . Among the fine supporting cast , the best are Geoffrey Lewis a Samuel Gummere , the cynical Ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue , and Steve Kanaly , a the gung-ho Marine Captain who cheerfully advocate ( and carry out ) `` Military intervention ! '' a the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation . Other familiar face such a Vladek Sheybal , Nadim Sawalha , Roy Jenson , Larry Cross , Marc Zuber , and Darrell Fetty also do fine work , no matter how small their role . Spaghetti Western fan will recognize Antoine Saint-John ( `` A Fistful of Dynamite '' ) a the German general and Aldo Sambrell a one of Raisuli 's tribesman . `` The Wind and the Lion '' is , all around , a wonderfully done adventure film . It ha something for everyone : wonderful gun- and swordplay , a lot of humor , a tough , feisty heroine ( and her two cute child ) , a nice ( if unconsummated ) romance , and an interesting ( if fanciful ) political/historical context . It 's not a masterpiece , but hey , it wa n't trying to be . I give `` The Wind and the Lion '' a stirring nine star and my highest recommendation .",1
"Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore . She left her parent house and got a job . Now , Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mother and daughter envy . They are best friend . The girl have an extensive knowledge of movie , and TV show , and are constantly quoting them . In the first season , Lorelai need money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school ) , so she reluctantly ha to turn to her parent . They are happy to give them the money , but in exchange , Rory ha to come have dinner with them every Friday night . I highly recommend this show . I love it !",1
"A found tape about 3 ? guy having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman way . Yeah , spoiler . First of all , the acting made this short not scary at all , the woman seemed to have orgasm , not suffering . Some of the punishment were so ridiculous ! what 's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair ? If you are shooting a nonsense tape , at least make it good . The only part to remark is the end : the hammered hand and the pierced eye , the rest of the film is really poor . To end the boredom , the supposed story about the tape being investigated , extra bullshit .",0
"The Biggest one that bug the hell out of me is that they say Zues take DUTCH command . But she is speaking German to him . The 2 languishes are completely different , it like saying `` well he take French command '' and start talking Spanish . James Belushi give more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest . The role just doe n't fit him , even if it mend to be a comedy . To many stereotype/predicable stuff . Typical comment or comeback . If you do n't look at those thing i think it could be a nice movie to watch if it ever on TV . But i would n't suggesting renting it .",0
"Where to start ? ? I think only three other film have led me to post a review on IMDb , and all of those were positive . As for this .. ? Mind-blowingly , hideously , tragically , embarrassingly , catastrophically , stupidly , irritatingly , completely and utterly beyond awful . I am STUNNED this got made , never mind given a theatrical release . I think I am literally in shock . I 'm no `` snob '' . I did n't expect beautiful film-making or intense character-depth , but this is truly beyond a joke . We simply MUST demand more from the film we see . Avoid . Like the Black Death .",0
"Nothing about this movie stand out a either being great or terrible . In the end , that is what kill it . The blandness is just not good . I ca n't say I expected better from Will Smith , but I definitely did from Kevin James of `` The King of Queens '' -- but , hey , I 'm getting used to saying that a lot lately . This film attempt to make it mark a a witty romantic comedy , but it never hit the bull's-eye . In fact , it never hit * anywhere * within the target . The allergy scene is disturbing ; the fact that Kevin James ca n't dance is something that would n't exactly catch anybody off-guard , and is therefore ( in a movie like this ) not funny . This movie constantly try to win your heart , but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time . Some part are okay ( but I 'm searching my brain for example ) , but I really think this movie should be avoided .",0
"Quite unimpressive . The 'twists ' are all pretty predictable , if you 've seen any movie within the last ten year , and the few somewhat interesting part ( wherein someone utilizes context clue to make a decision ) are few and lack much punch , since the 'secret ' ha already been shown before these clue are explained . ( spoiler , sorta ) The acting is decent enough . The story simply is n't very interesting . The whole 'still awake ' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff ( not kidding ) . The surgery scene is initially tense , a bit discomforting , but then becomes utterly banal . Not horrible , but not memorable . Terrence Howard 's least interesting role to date , so far a I 've seen . Kind of boring , overall .",0
"Bad actor , terrible script , totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all . After seeing film like this , you wonder why the maker bothered at all . This film ha absolutely nothing to say , all the method used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror film . A total waste of time .",0
"I ca n't say I enjoyed this a much a `` The Big Lebowski '' or `` Raising Arizona , '' and felt a little slighted , but `` O Brother '' is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laugh and a taste of the Coens ' brisk , twisted sense of creativity . The DVD edition contains the featurette , and I wa interested to find out that the Coens are pretty simple in their directorial technique . That surprised me ! Of course , this movie is not the best example ( and I 'm only saying this in comparison ) and it wa n't worthy of any Oscars ( many feel it wa robbed ) , but maybe it depends on the appeal . Though I enjoyed the Coens ' previous work , I 've never been a fan of old western or `` The Dukes of Hazzard '' or any of that stuff they show daily on TNN . I guess that 's why I did n't feel a enthusiastic about checking out this movie , seeing that it revolves around Southern folk . For all those from the South who are reading this , I do n't mean to offend ANY of your people ! I 'm sure you guy feel the same way when you watch movie about urban area like `` A Bronx Tale . '' When you live in the city all your life , it 's hard to get accustomed to film of this nature . But all apology aside , I found the character fun and quirky . I think John Turturro nailed the accent perfectly , and seeing the way he talk in real life I find that amazing . Tim Blake Nelson wa also good . Of course , George Clooney -- who I assume is not the best at feigning accent , judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for `` The Perfect Storm '' -- naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggle with the accent . His performance wa good , though . You can also spot Coen regular like Holly Hunter ( in a short but sweet role ) and John Goodman ( also on screen for a short time , but steal every minute of it ) . Though I do n't normally dig country music , I liked the title song `` A Man of Constant Sorrow . '' The DVD also contains the music video for that song . Overall , I found the film entertaining and original , but it doe n't have that in-your-face quality that the Coens have shown to u in the past . It 's a slighter effort , but a good one . I still suggest you check it out . My score : 7 ( out of 10 )",1
"God , what an awful thing ! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something ( see the terrible use of music and picture here ) but what for really ? The whole thing behind `` Natural born killer '' seems to be a `` clever '' look at how medias can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turn into trash itself . Please Mr. Stone , next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv show using violence to get high rate , avoid doing the same with your movie ! Michael Haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it wa denouncing medium fascism with fascist cinematographic way . How true ... Only he forgot to tell u about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap !",0
"Stars : Hayden Pantierre . There have been so many movie that have this exact same plot , and this one is just a poor rehashing of it . Populer white girl move to ethnic school , doe n't fit in , soon becomes accepted . Originality is nonexistent in this , and neither are the laugh . It us so many old poorly executed joke it 's annoying . I do n't know why they think it 's a good idea to make made for video sequel to mediocre film , but it is n't . With that said , the positive in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actor and actress . My rating : * out of * * * * . PG-13 for Language and Sexual Humor .",0
"First , let 's get it out of the way . . . yeah , this film steal a LOT from 'Darkness Falls ' ( 2003 ) . The plot for 'Darkness Falls ' go something like this : The Tooth Fairy , a murderous woman who hide her face due to disfigurement kill people who look at her out of revenge . In 'The Tooth Fairy ' ( 2006 ) , the disfigured Tooth Fairy ( who , yeah , hide her face ) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone . A little too similar to be coincidence . But , what must be asked is this : If you 're going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie , why choose something a mediocre a 'Darkness Falls ' ? Sure it made a few buck at the box office , but that wa strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered . A low-budget , straight-to-video movie will not have that same effect . And it did n't . As I watched the opening 15-20 minute of the film , my expectation actually rose . There seemed to be at least SOME production value . The story did n't seem terrible , just blatantly ripped off . Past the first scene , we get an okay cast of character including an ex-doctor with secret ( played by that guy who look like a Busey ) and some hot veterinary student ( Jenifer from Argento 's 'Masters of Horror : Jenifer ' ) . After those few minute , however , the film just slowly go down the drain . It serf all the basic horrible clichés including , but not limited to : some crazy old person with an unheeded warning , the buff dumb jock , the psychic , and the stripper with the heart-of-gold . One of the biggest problem this film had wa it inability to stick with a target audience . It 's kind of like the filmmaker wanted to change the tone for whatever character wa on screen at the time . When the adult were on screen , it had a more mature feel . When Star ( the stripper ) and whatshisface ( the jock ) were on screen , the dialogue went down to a more stupid , err immature , level . When the kid wa on screen , it felt like an episode of 'Are You Afraid of the Dark ? ' . . . only le scary . Technically , the film is all over the place . The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring . The writing is subpar , a is the acting for the most part . On the plus side , there 's some excessive gore at part ( including a fairly cool ( yet painfully predictable ) ) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene . Also , if you 're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff , there 's a brief topless scene ( but if you want to see this chick topless , there are better film to do that ) . Other than that , there 's not much to bother with when it come to this film . If you 're a huge fan of 'Darkness Falls ' ( do those exist ? ) , maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way . . . but , that 's about the only reason I can find to see this one . Final Verdict : 3/10 -AP3-",0
"Like those who listened to radio report about the attack on Pearl Harbor , every one who ha ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it -- and some thirty year later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile , obnoxious , repulsive , and hilariously funny film ever put to celluloid , guaranteed to test the strongest stomach and the toughest funny bone . Filmed with a close-to-zero budget and some of the shakiest cinematography around , PINK FLAMINGOS tell the story of two family that compete for the tabloid title of `` The Filthiest People Alive . '' Just how filthy can they be ? Plenty : the film includes everything from sex with chicken to what I can only describe a a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo , and I guarantee that you wo n't want to eat an egg for at least several week after seeing it . The cast is either wonderful , atrocious , or atrociously wonderful , depending on how you look at it . The star , of course , is Divine ... and to describe Divine a the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year . She is a mammoth creature given to BIG eye makeup , BIG orange hair , and BIG expression -- she is the Charleton Heston of drag , and whether she is almost running down a jogger , pausing to use the bathroom on some one 's front lawn , or startling real-life shopper by taking a stroll along a Baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny . Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce , Danny Mills , and the ever-appalling Edith Massey a member of Divine 's family ; and Mink Stole and David Lochary a the white-slaving , baby-selling couple who challenge Divine 's status . It should be pretty obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one , and viewer who know director John Waters only through such later film a HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will be in for a major jolt . But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python could n't imagine it , this is the movie for you . Just make sure you eat before you see it , because you probably wo n't want to eat afterward -- and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case . Gary F. Taylor , aka GFT , Amazon Reviewer",1
"This is one of those movie where I just want to move my foot and dance around the house . It 's a very positive and happy type of music . The movie ha some sad part but mostly the music is what make me happy . Gary Busey did a great job a Buddy Holly . Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor , his parent and the Nashville record producer told him no . Buddy Holly did n't give up on what he liked . I did n't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie . I 've been to the Surf Ballroom where he last played but did n't give much attention to it until I watched this movie . It 's an incredible movie with lot of fun so get on your foot and see this movie .",1
"Wow , what a great cast ! Julia Roberts , John Cusack , Christopher Walken , Catherine Zeta-Jones , Hank Azaria ... what 's that ? A script , you say ? Now you 're just being greedy ! Surely such a charismatic bunch of thespian will weave such fetching tapestry of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary ? You 'd think so , but no . America 's Sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another . It 's like everyone involved woke up before each day 's writing/shooting/editing and though `` You know what ? I 've been working pretty hard lately , and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big name , right ? I 'm just gon na cruise along and let somebody else carry the can . '' So much potential , yet so painful to sit through . There is n't a single aspect of this thing that doe n't suck . Even Julia 's fat suit is lame .",0
"Nice movie with a great soundtrack which span through the rock landscape of the 70 's and 80 's . Radiofreccia describes a generation , it describes life in a small village near Correggio ( hometown of Ligabue , the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie ) , it describes life of young people and their problem relating to the world . It reminds of Trainspotting , with a bit of Italian touch .",1
"I 'd waited for some year before this movie finally got released in England , but wa in many way very pleased when I finally saw it . There are a lot of great thing to the film , for a start the acting . Its not something I have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work . This and the constantly gripping and interesting script , with a nice sorta Lovecraftian feel to it , give the film a real solid backbone . Add to this the dos of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the film a winner . It ha my favorite kind of gore too , supernatural and splattery . Also , the character of Marcus , the angry bodybuilding transsexual and Daisy , his mentally retarded lover/plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at time , and give a far out , anything go sense of morbid grown up craziness which work well with the frequent Freudian overtone . This is one of the most impressive recent horror movie , far more shocking or out there than anything Hollywood can produce . My only gripe wa that I wanted the ending to be darker in tone , but it still work , so on the whole I 'd really recommend this to serious horror buff .",1
"This movie ha one or two slightly interesting gag but they are NOT worth the wait . After an unexplained argument between two guy picking up litter in a drive-in movie theatre we cut to a family leaving ! Hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again a inane dialogue is voiced over . At least I think it 's inane , the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loud it render the dialogue at time almost inaudible . Finally the camper van arrives , at night , at a gas station where the family get out , have another inane conversation , before driving off . The camera then pan across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away . He talk straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him , and how he came to make the movie . A nice idea which ALMOST ( but not quite ) make the previous sequence worth the pain . As the movie unfolds he encounter the two character we met picking litter at the start of the movie and they all form a motion picture company . All sort of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues a they put together a crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming . This movie wa obviously put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea get lost . Comedy is more than thing just falling over and everyone talking ( or shouting ) at once . So much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actor simultaneously - Robert Altman can do this sort of thing well because he ha a script , rehearsal , decent sound techie , and editing facility . Everyone shouting at the one mike which , by the sound of it , wa hidden in a dustbin in the next room , doe not make for clarity .",0
"I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever ! ! ! If you are in the mood for a comedy , I totally recommend this movie ! So , here 's the summary . There is this girl ( Nikki ) who is fourteen and a half and she go on a vacation with her father ( Andre ) whom she ha n't seen for about two year . She expects the vacation to be totally boring , until she meet this boy ( Ben ) , who is much older than she is . So , to try to impress him she say that she is n't on vacation with her father , but her lover . This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end , and I highly suggest it . So rent it and enjoy ! ! !",1
"Well here come another , well , romantic comedy ... but unlike all others movie of this genre , this is by far the best I have seen in a long while .. I 'll admit , at first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox , and a little because of Simon Pegg ... First of all , if you have watched a decent amount of movie , you will know that Sidney and Alison would be together at the and of the movie , one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you wo n't know how ... Okay , now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg.I ca n't see any other actor in the role of Sidney , and I 'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for Pegg 's great performance . There is a number of great gag and joke in this movie that kept me laughing really hard , courtesy of Simon Pegg 's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good.For example , Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie ( I usually do n't think of her a any more than an average actress , but she wa really good in this one ) , then there 's Jeff Bridges , there 's Gillian Anderson , and of course Megan Fox who play spoiled bitchy star Sophie Maes ... great role for her ... All in all , while I usually do n't agree with rating her on IMDb , this time I would completely agree with them ... Go and see this movie , it is really light-hearted and positive , and I recommend it deeply ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...",1
"With the advent of the IMDb , this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience . Why ? Because user here who do a search on two-time Academy Award winner Glenda Jackson can find 'The Return of The Soldier ' among her credit . So can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie . Fans of Ann-Margret can give the title a click , a will those looking into the career of the great Alan Bates . Not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweight Ian Holm and Frank Finlay . Any movie with so many notable in it is rewarded by the IMDb , given all the cross-referencing that go on here . So , why is n't this movie out on DVD ? Do n't the Producers realize the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a film ? And 'The Return of The Soldier ' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered .

"[ WARNING : CONTAINS SPOILERS ] Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky ( who also directed ) and Maya Forbes , this indie film is one of the better romantic comedy in recent memory . Jay Mohr take a break from playing smarmy weasel to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée want to bed other people and he 's allowed to do so , too . Julianne Nicholson , who wa so good in `` Tully , '' play spunky and vulnerable with great gusto . Too bad she doe n't get the recognition she deserves . Good supporting performance help immensely , too . Lauren Graham , who made last year 's `` Bad Santa '' memorable , play the jaded , cynical sister to perfection , Bryan Cranston ( the dad on TV 's `` Malcolm in the Middle '' ) get a few funny , raunchy moment , and Andy Richter play a genial guy who fall for a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible , albeit familiar , role a a mousy woman . What surprised me most about `` Seeing Other People '' wa how funny it is . There are some genuine laugh here . Ed 's first attempt at meaningless sex get some great line , and there 's a ménage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reaction from a man a the male fantasy get tweaked . The film 's premise is n't unusual , but I liked that it wa Alice ( Nicholson ) who thought of it , much to the chagrin of Ed ( Mohr ) . Given the genre , you know that no matter how good her intention are , Alice 's plan is doomed . We see how the couple work through this strange situation . Initially , Alice and Ed are turned on by the idea , but then the human element set it . I appreciated Forbes and Wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp . Yes , there 's sex and nudity , but there also are real emotion at work here . The `` other people '' Alice and Ed befriend do n't want to be the object of casual sex ; they have feeling , too . In one case , too many feeling . Granted , some scene run one joke too many , the Richter-Slater subplot is n't necessary and Alice doe something truly uncharacteristic . But that 's forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scene where Ed rummage through Alice 's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game , we root for this couple to succeed . Unfortunately , this film got little , if any , publicity and a limited release . Hollywood studio , whose romantic comedy often veer on the unfunny , turgid and unsurprising , would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film .",1
"What a terrible movie ! It represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of French society , where the most elementary respect for wholesome value and tradition ha completely disappeared . The plot is nonsensical , the movie is not funny at all and the character are completely shallow and uninteresting . To say the least , the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired . Catherine Deneuve is a bad an actress a she always wa , even when she wa directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour . The rest of the usually good cast ( Vincent Lindon , Line Renaud , Jean Yanne ) seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity , platitude and restlessness . I can not help to draw a parallel with the wonderful James Ivory 's `` Le Divorce '' , with it thoughtful depiction of French and American more , it superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use . Having watched `` Le Divorce '' you can feel a kind of empathy with the French , regardless of their foible . `` Belle-Maman '' leaf you with only a nauseated contempt for it morally bankrupt and clueless protagonist .",0
"This film 's kind of like Conan the Barabarian , but with more sex , rape and murder . There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmaker do n't do a good job showing it , which is a shame because it 'could ' be a decent story . Richard Hill give a solid performance in the lead role , a doe the villain - who sadly did n't appear in anything else of note . The fight scene are n't too bad either - I love the way Deathstalker let his sword 'drink ' the blood of his victim - and there 's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout . All in all , not good - but not necessarily that bad either ...",0

"The film had it moment , but wa disappointing in my eye anyway . It wa a reworking of Trespass ( Walter Hill ) and so The Treasure Of the Sierra Madre , with le tension , bite and human emotion . There wa some nice acting but the story wa limp and lacked any real depth . I watched the movie for Mr Reno and Mr Fishburn , neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for . This movie ha been done to death in the past and did not have to be made , eats up money which could be used on better movie . For an action movie it wa sparse of action and a a thriller did not thrill . Better than watching snow fall , but not for me .",0
"Even MST3K could n't make this painful , long , and ultimately mind-bending drek funny or entertaining . While most bad movie in and of themselves are hilariously bad , this one is one of those few video that us the word bad in it literal sense . The element that make this so PAINFUL to watch is not the lack of story , but the fact that SOOOO much background is crammed into the first half-hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no headlight . The hero of the film , Ator , is no more than eye-candy for this literal energy-sucker of a film . Dressed in a loin-cloth and sporting `` pecs like melon , '' a Joel put it , he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here .

The story might not be all that interesting or credible but it tie in neatly with the story of the game and ha several honest-to-god funny moment ! ! A total surprise there and a welcome one too There are lot of cameo and funny reference to the game too . And most important of all : The fighting scene rock so hard they could cut through diamond ! They are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked . I mean , they are some of the best ever created PERIOD . See this movie . Bye . PS : I know my review sound like the raving of a teenage girl . It wa , like , totally what I intended .",1
"Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thought , unlike many other great Ford film , like The Searchers , My Darling Clementine , The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , and The Grapes of Wrath among others , but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction . The story is very simple : two cowboy decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California . Along the way , they run into a medicine man whose mule ran away , a group of bank robber , and some Navajos . There 's a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail , and the film is imbued with fun and beauty . The music is absolutely beautiful . The scenery , again from Monument Valley , is a beautiful a it ever wa . Plus , how can you go wrong with James Arness ? The Wagonmaster might not be one of John Ford 's better known film , but it is nonetheless a must-see if you get the chance . 9/10 .",1
"This wa the most unrealistic movie I ever seen . I ca n't believe that the writer and director did n't see that almost all the movie look like a SF one . For example : 1 . It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hour to get up so quickly . 2 . You ca n't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie . ( believe me , it 's my domain ) 3 . With a saw you can cut 10 pipe in 10 hour very easy . Let 's say that the chain wa made from steel but the water pipe wa rusty and it wa made from iron . 4 . If you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint ( in the best case , it 's more likely to die because your hart fails ) before to get to the bone ( shin ) . And there are more other example .",0
"A very great movie . A big love story . Lots of sword fighting . Huge battle scene . Heros and villain . Real history . Few in the West know much Chinese history . Chin Zchaundi founded China . The country is in fact named after him . Some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed . This is a historical epic of how he ended the Period of Contending States and unified China . He founded a dynasty that only last 14 year but it wa immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that permanently defined Chinese civilization ever since . Chin ( or the King of Zheng a he wa known before he founded the empire ) wa roughly contemporaneous with Scipio , Hannibal , and Fabius in the West . The parallel Roman world dominance ( West and East world ) wa achieved without a single towering personality like Chin . It would not be for another century before the West produced Caesar - the nearest comparable Western figure . Chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot . History only record the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaf room for real character development over the course of this long film . The famous story about the meeting with the assassin is a true a any two thousand year old anecdote can be . Gong Li is lovely . She is the emotional core of the story . It all make for great movie making .",1
"I saw this `` movie '' partly because of the sheer number of good review at Netflix , and from it I leaned a valuable lesson . Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however ... the lesson I learned is `` Do n't trust review '' . Yes , racism suck and people are complicated , but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the one who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they DO see it . The only reason that I can think of for the number of good review is that it 's being reviewed by people who are n't used to thinking , or who 've seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept . In fact , he basically made this film , which should be called `` Racism For Dummies '' , a emotionally wrenching a possible , seemingly to give people who do n't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they 've discovered some fundamental truth that 's never been covered in a film before . Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it 's not ... An after-school special for the unthinking mass , cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted piece to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection . It 's a if they portrayed everyone a being the worst possible extreme , simply to make u happy that we 're such good people because we do n't identify with the character . Let 's face it people . NOBODY identifies with these character because they 're all cardboard cutout and stereotype ( or predictably reverse-stereotypes ) . It 's well acted ( even if the dialog is atrocious ) and cleverly executed , so much that you do n't think to ask `` where 's the beef ? '' until you can tell the film is winding down . The flaming car scene wa well executed , like much of the movie , but went nowhere in the end . The message are very heavy-handed , and from the `` behind the scene '' blurb , the producer were clearly watching a different movie , because there is very little to laugh about in this movie , even during the intended funny part . I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment , more like a high school diversity lesson ... call it the `` Blood on the Highway '' of racism . They could even show this in high school if it were n't for the `` side-nude '' shot of Jennifer Esposito . In this film , everyone 's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson ( except for Michael Pena who get the best role , but the most predictable storyline ) . This is a bad film , with bad writing , and good actor .... an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who ca n't handle anything but the bold stroke in storytelling .... a picture painted with crayon . Crash is a depressing little nothing , that provokes emotion , but teach you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad thing .",0
"As a Westerner watching another culture 's view and tradition of marriag , I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful . The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parent is difficult , especially in this modern age . Yet this is the case in this Hindi film . Told with humor , and fresh perspective , we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon . As said , it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom a an arranged marriage still take place . We see the awkwardness that this young couple feel a they come together on their first night , and how they try to forge a bond , even though they do not know one another . We see different view of marriage and commitment a presented by the other couple also on holiday , from a couple of forty year married to others still unsure of making marital commitment . There 's song , witty dialog , poignant moment , blending and comparison of new way and tradition . Watching the movie with subtitle definitely loses some of the trueness of the story , yet it is still a delight to watch . Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived ; however the overall movie wa worth watching .",1
"My nose is bent slightly out of shape a I write this . I had sent a previous comment on this film some week ago that ha not yet appeared , so I assume it wa rejected , even though it met all the usual guideline . I found this film interesting for the first thirty minute , particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà , a veteran actor who ha appeared in such major production a `` Blow '' and `` The Alamo . '' Leonor Watling is also quite good . Unfortunately , everything sink eventually under the weight of a truly awful , melodramatic script . There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that doe nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art . An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much le arduous than having to encounter these fictional character again anywhere , anytime .",0
"This is an interesting movie . I think it 's very humorous , although the humor is very black . Fulci is good and funny acting himself , it 's a really funny and truly crazy `` self-portrait '' of an artist ( `` I make horror film . If I would make love film , no-one would buy ticket ... '' ) . And it 's really SEXY movie also : Almost all the time there is some `` action '' or tension going on ; and many sexy girls/women ... Maybe it go to the core of why anyone start to do movies/art in the first place ... It 's a real psychedelic trip , maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind . There is some really nasty gore scene also , of course , because it 's Lucio Fulci . As a matter of fact some of those scene are quite disgusting . Anyway it 's one of the three best and most complete Fulci film I 've seen ( the others are House By The Cemetery & Zombi.Have n't seen The Beyond ) . Actually , the script is overally , to my opinion , quite ingenious . You could see this movie a a portrait of an extreme neurotic , or a person who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder ( fashionable word ) : The character ha a compulsive need to confess `` crime '' or bad thought ; Especially crime he ha n't even DONE . And he question himself all the time : What if I HAVE done it ? What if I want to do it ? Have I done it ? Do I want to do it ? He overreacts and exaggerates his thought . I 'm sure Fulci ha been interested of psychology , and maybe even read something of the area ; in his `` House By The Cemetery '' -movie for example there is a character named Freudstein . This is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie Fulci did . I also like the simplicity of the photography/pictures in this film . Only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism , especially towards woman ; I do n't quite understand why ? Is it entertainment ? Is it art ? Is it horror ? Anyways and overall , this is really interesting and well made movie , definitely recommended classic film at least for fan or anyone interested of this genre . For the others it may be too much .",1
"I could not watch more than 10 minute of this movie . It ha set the standard . I will never again give a movie a 1 , unless it wa a horrible a this one . I fully agree with the other comment about this film . But , since I 'm Dutch , I watched it with Dutch translation . Apparently , they did n't have money for a proper translation , so they decided to babelfish it . With sometimes hilarious result . Do n't smoke , do n't drink , do n't do drug , do n't watch Demon Summer . I wa surprised that the actor ( Wow , I ca n't believe I just said that . ) did n't hold the script ( Was there any ? ) in their hand while shooting . I think they also did a good job on ... Well ... Uhmm ... No , they did n't do a good job at all .",0
"Okay , I had watched this movie when I wa very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see this ! I thought , '' I have no idea of what this movie wa like , '' so I went ahead and put it in.OH MY GOD ! ! ! ! ! This film is so darn bad ! I never thought that this film could ever get a close to my least favorite film a it did , but I did laugh , because all the joke were so corny and ridiculous , not funny ! ! ! ! So much stuff in this movie wa funny , because it wa SO STUPID ! ! ! ! This film is not anywhere near good.I would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you 've already seen it , trust me , I feel your pain a well ! ! ! !",0
"I had n't planned on seeing this movie , however I wa n't disappointed when a friend dragged me along . Although there are no real surprise here , the guy do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget . If you 've seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there 's a pretty constant stream of joke here , with a couple of classic moment , with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guy were like in the 1980 's . Also , I 've read elsewhere that the ending wa a disappointment , but I found it refreshingly different from what I had expected from this genre . Overall , this movie wont change your life , but it 's got enough laugh there to keep you entertained throughout .",1
"Yeah , that about sum it up . This movie wa horrifying . Two minute in I wanted to gouge my eye out . This ha been praised a an `` innovative LDS comedy , '' but it 's not even good for member of that church ! I do n't think any human being should be so victimized a to watch a movie of this low quality . First of all , you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie . It seems a if the horribly drab , glib , trite plot wa thrown together by two crazy weasel somehow imbued with the gift for coherent ( at least semi-coherent ) thought . Then , there 's the acting , which is dismal from * everybody * involved . Even the cameo fail to liven anything up . And let 's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change , but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue , appallingly hideous `` gag , '' and a lot of Mormon `` in-joke '' that anyone in their right mind , LDS or not , should consider purely * stupid * ! This ha to be one of the worst film I 've ever seen !",0
"Infamous horror film seldom measure up the hype that surround them and I have yet to come across a worse offender than Wes Craven 's The Hills Have Eyes . Having held back from watching this for year , I wa really pleased when I got it for Christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend wa out to settle down and watch it - knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying . I need n't have bothered . After a promising - if familiar - start , that firmly set the film in the 'Desolution USA ' world of survival horror , thing rapidly go to piece when the protagonist and antagonist meet in the deserted wasteland . Looking like it wa shot on a budget of $ 5 , with the cannibal clan 's costume hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and Red Indian attire , the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic WASPs who take a detour on a road trip to California , to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone ( ! ) . When they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh-eaters and have to fight to survive . While hoping for another Deliverance , Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Wrong Turn or Devil 's Rejects , I actually realised I 'd stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video store 's bargain bin . With gallon of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close-ups , I can kind of see how an 18 Certificate ( in the UK ) is justified , but with those close-ups trimmed this would n't have looked out of place a a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV . The whole silver mine/nuclear test site subplot is just a McGuffin to justify pitching the 'civilised ' family against the primitive , but given how easily the savage get their ass whupped it stretch credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passer-by . And then there 's the ending ... or lack thereof . The Hills Have Eyes seems to be missing either a third act or , at the very least , a satisfying denouement . Instead , I wa just left wondering : `` Yeah , and ... ? ''",0
"Although at first glance this movie look like the story of your parent 's high school life ( and many people will try to tell you that this movie is WAY outdated ) ... and I admit that that wa MY first impression .... but honestly , the 'lessons ' that are learned by the heroes/heroines are def . NOT outdated . Who doe n't want to be famous ? And who doe n't want do be accepted my their peer ? And the homosexual guy-is n't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage , blah , blah ? This movie , though released in the 80 's still address some of the biggest issue in today 's world . This movie doe have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste , though . ( thus the 8/10 rating )",1
"There are not many film which I would describe a perfect , but Rififi definitely fit the bill . No other heist film ha come close to it , before or after . The plot is simple , but engrosses you . It never cease to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it . You care for all the character , even though they are bank robber , because they are presented a human being with all their problem and flaw . It 's hard to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le Stéphanois . When the member of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to Tony , his answer and the expression on his face say it all . While the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie ( and rightfully so ) the film actually get better afterward.The director Jules Dassin knew what he wa doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout , but instead inserted a great climactic score during Tony 's final ride towards his destiny . To think that if Dassin , an American Director , had not been blacklisted in Hollywood and forced to work in France , this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it wa . It certainly would n't have been a good if it wa made a an American film during that time . It wa absolutely horrible what Dassin had to go through , but he did achieve his greatest work because of it , to the benefit of all of u . I 'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming Al Pacino remake . Most heist film since Rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another . There 's no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money . Leave the classic alone !",1
"Soul Calibur ha always been my favorite fighting game series of all time . And SCIII is my favorite one of the series . The graphic are very well done . Much bigger improvement over the choppy polygon in Soul Edge/Soul Blade . The character have facial expression , hair blow in the breeze and they even blink . Soul Calibur ha always been known for it 's interesting plot and character and SCIII is no exception . Each character ha his/her background story that is detailed and well done . My favorite character is Chai Xianghua . She 's cute , she 's funny and she 's a strong female character . Yeah , I know she wear pink and ha a boyfriend ( who she end up saving BTW ) , but there seems to be more to her than that . Xianghua , like all the other character , have flaw and upside to their personality , so no character is perfect , not even the good guy . The music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series . It doe n't sound kitchy ( the Vampire series ) nor doe it sound like old school porn film soundtrack ( Mortal Kombat ) . The character have their own theme and a lot of the theme are done to match the culture of that certain part of the world . I do n't think there is a song on this soundtrack I do n't like . Another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character ( Create a Soul ) . You could make him/her look a cute or a sexy or even ugly if you like . However , if you found a character customization that you like , remember to take note , or else you wo n't remember how you created that character . I found myself being very addicted to CaS . Overall , I think Soul Calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time . It ha everything I asked for . What more could I want ?",1
"Yes , I know that this movie is meant a a comedy ! And the humor is over the top ! But the theme about people getting le intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched ! I can not say that it will happen , but if we do n't take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility ! I have noticed that some school are n't teaching fact anymore ! ( Like history , geography , basic stuff ) . The focus is more on learning practical ability ! The theory behind most subject may be boring but is essential in understanding how thing work ! In the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crop with Gatorade in stead of water ! Well , we can laugh about it ! But if you never been taught that water contains mineral necessary for plant to grow so how would you know ! To me this is a scary notion ! So now you understand why this subject is n't funny anymore ! It could be that Mike Judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doe n't improve fast ! Am I taking this movie too seriously ! Yes of course ! To each his own fun ! I loved Mike Judge 's work ( Beavis and Butthead and Office space ) ! In these he wa able to be critical and funny at the same time ! In `` Idiocracy '' I missed this ! Most of the event are too absurd and a I said earlier very scary ! I do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie !",1
"The original animated Dark Knight return in this ace adventure movie that rival Mask of Phantasm in it coolness . There 's a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman , so much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin . There 's a new crime-fighter on the street of Gotham . She dress like a bat but she 's not a grown-up Batgirl . And Batman is denying any affiliation with her . Meanwhile Bruce Wayne ha to deal with the usual romance and detective work . But the Penguin , Bain and the local Mob make thing little more complicated . I did n't have high hope for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak Batman : Sub Zero ( Robin is n't featured so much here ! ) but I wa delighted with the imaginative and exciting set piece , the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor . This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without . Keep your ear open for a really catchy song called 'Betcha Neva ' which is featured prominently through-out . It 's a shame the DVD is n't so great . Do n't get me wrong there are some great feature ( the short 'Chase Me ' is awesome ) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan . Batman : Mystery of the Batwoman wa drawn and shot in 1.85:1 but this DVD is presented in 1.33:1 an in comparison to the widescreen clip shown on the feature there IS picture cut off on both side . I find this extremely annoying considering Mask of Phantasm wa presented in anamorphic widescreen . Warner have had to re-release literally dozen of movie on DVD because people have complained about the lack of Original Aspect Ratio available on some title . Why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me . I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5 . It 's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great DVD package .",1
"If you asked me to pick the best acted movie ever made , this movie would be on a short list along with 1951 's Streetcar Named Desire . I imagine i 'll discover some others that qualify , but Kramer v Kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism . So it a very satisfying experience on that level : just watching the marvelous , probing performance of Dustin Hoffman , Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular . One of the best child performance ever . But I also find it very satisfying to watch , because it such a thoroughly involving story - it always make me forget my own problem . It ha such excellent narrative drive . Once you stick Kramer v Kramer on , and Alice Kramer leaf Ted to juggle work and their young son , telling him nothing more than she ha to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turn out okay for them . And even once you know how thing do turn out , each moment of the ride just ring so brilliantly true that it a joy to watch it happen again and again . Make no mistake - Kramer v Kramer is not light entertainment : it a very realistic portrayal of the effect of divorce on everyone involved . 10/10 . For one of the best script ( born out of conversation between Benton and Hoffman , who wa going through a divorce at the time ) ever written , executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly . Not to mention what a great , involving story it is . Put simply , a perfect film .",1
"Let me say at the outset that I 'm not a very artistic person and that I do n't `` get '' new art . That being said , this film is absolutely crazy , and in my opinion not crazy in a good way . Filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected story , Avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say `` wow , I feel the energy and passion of this painting . '' The only reason I give this film a 3 out of 10 is because I actually did manage to laugh at some part , though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film . Two of the character throwing chair on a lawn , a to do what these character were doing , I have no idea . I would n't recommend this film to anybody .",0
Wonderful film that mix documentary and fiction in a way that make the spectator question : what is the extent of truth in documentary film or is there such a thing a an objective documentary .,1
"It ha been some year since I saw this , but remember it and would like to see it again . It kind of became a `` therapy '' for me with a personal experience of my own . A thirty-five year old man lament over a high-school baseball game in which he `` missed the ball '' and his team lost . He think about it 20 year later , `` if only I 'd hit that ball '' and how his life would be better because of it . Then , he get a chance to find out .... and get a little more than he bargained for . It reminds me so much of when I wa in high school , I twice tried out for our drill/dance team and did n't make it . This team wa the closest thing to a sorority in my school . If you were on it , you were `` all that . '' I did n't try out till my last two year of HS and after the second time , I took it really hard . I 'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryout and wore tights to cover the bruise , and that caused me to not make it . That wa in 1987 . Through the year , even now sometimes , I think `` If only I had n't hit my leg I would 've never worn those stupid tights . '' Now I do n't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had I made it , but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different thing may be by changing one little thing way back in the past . Who know , it could have changed the course of event to the point that I would n't have met my son 's father . I would recommend this movie to anyone who ha that one moment in the past they wish they could change . Be careful what you wish for ! ! !",1
"Not really a big box office draw , but I wa pleasently surprised with this movie . James `` I did some thing to Farrah Fawcett '' Orr co-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary , average guy named Larry Burrows who think his life would have been incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game when he wa 15 . But thanks to mysterious and magical bartender Mike , Larry get his wish , yet soon realizes that his new life is n't exactly a he hoped it would be . I must say , this movie really impressed me . Critics have given it mixed , and I must say the concept is really interesting and pulled off well . Yes , it is a little standard , but pack enough funny moment , drama and excellent acting to make it really good . James Belushi ( I think ) wa Oscar worthy for his role . Jon Lovitz is perfect , and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shine in their role . Michael Caine is perfect a the bartender . It 's just a good movie with a good lesson . If you 've never seen , I highly recommend you check",1
"This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where it hard to decide whats worse , the acting , or the writing/directing/producing ( John Sheppherd helm all three . ) Basic story : obsessed exobiologist capture chubacabra monster , smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escape and the blood bath begin . Clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter , handsome hero and mad scientist . Captian call in a terrorist alert for the ship ( since of course would n't believe a monster story . ) No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here . Budget only allowed for entire force force of eight seal to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ship wench aboard . Puleeze . Also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer . I also loved when the Seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten mile away wa able to see three people jump of the ship . If the Sci-Fi channel is going to continue original movie I hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better script and director . If this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 cent bin .",0
"And that go especially for lawyer & cop . Puerto Rico , which boast of a small , but potent film production firm , brings this multi layered tale of corruption , due to the on going drug cartel that start in South America , make a pit stop on the island commonwealth , and then northbound into North America . Steven Bauer , the most recognizable face on screen here , lead a cast of top notch actor , in a story of `` can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd ? '' . Ricardo Mendez Matta move up from directing mainly action adventure fare for American television , in a screenplay written by Matta , along with Poli Marichal . The rest of the cast ( Elpidia Carrillo , Magda Rivera , Jose Herredia , Luz Maria Randon , to mention a few ) turn in oh so fine role , in a film that will keep you wondering `` is there any respectable character here ? '' . Spoken in Spanish with English subtitle . Rated ' R ' by the MPAA , this film contains outburst of vulgar language , brief flash of nudity , adult content & violence , some of which is quite lurid .",1
"In a lot of way this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema , in term of capturing those strange , elusive moment of unguarded truth . In other way , it is undeniably an amateurish , unfocused result of junky self-indulgently fooling around with a camera . Ultimately it come out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability ( thankfully much more so the former than the latter ) . Part of me want to reward it solely for it 's absolute innovativeness and moment of pure sublimity , but at the same time I ca n't completely ignore the occasionally downright awful `` acting '' and overtly bad production value . At first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting ( or maybe just wrongheadedly `` innovative '' ) , but after a while I got used to it , which is , in the end , the true sign of whether a film succeeds on it 's own term or not . I guess that answer basically sum up my all-around feeling for the film . That is , despite it 's in-ignorable flaw , on a whole it doe work very well . And , if nothing else , a film like this really show how false and contrived the faux-documentary , shaky-cam style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect ( such a in film like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger ) . Here the aesthetic are plainly derived from the necessity of the filming situation , and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look `` cool '' .",1
"Children love dinosaur . It 's somewhat part of their culture . But they 've got The Land Before Time . The original . At least that movie had heart . This . This movie is just plain pathetic . Just because kid love dinosaur doe n't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the child . This movie ha no plot , the whole premise is stupid , and it 's more by the number stuff . Not a soul sucking a Theodore Rex , but it 's lightyears away from being a Land Before Time .",0
"Last week I watched a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Macbeth . It wa 25 year old , filmed w/no prop except sword , no furniture except chair . It wa RIVETING . The acting wa super - all the actor trained Brits . Contrast that performance to this ... yawn yawn yawn . Al Pacino , a Shylock , wa tragic , heavy , and could n't quite lose the New Yorker accent , despite the long .... pause .... between ..... line .... The whole thing wa soporific , even the `` comic '' scene were barely even worth a smile , let a lone a belly laugh . This is supposed to be funny . They tried to make it tragic . It wa neither , just boring . I give it four point for costume , scenery , and Jeremy Irons , who is good at playing a dull , depressed , deep-voiced guy ( can he be anything else ? ? ? )",0
I just love this film it totally rock ! Nicolas Cage look hot and Tommy doe not ! I definitely feel that Fred and Randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause they 're totally cool . My favorite part is when he say `` Peter Piper Picked A Pepper I guess I Did ! '',1
"In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it wa `` The Greeks Do n't Get No Freeks '' . Is that right ? I really liked that sound . I also liked the `` Hyde 's Got Nothing to Hide '' in the final scene . Truly a doper movie , but with many laugh and pun , sight gag , and slapstick . Madam Woo-Woo 's place wa reminiscent of some place I have visited myself . Ivy Venus ha appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing . She look much different in the movie we 're talking about , but her maturity did n't hurt her a bit . Mark Blankfield reminds one of Gene Wilder in some way . Bess Armstrong wa beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time .",1
"I 've seen this movie quite a few time and each time I watch it , the quirkier and funnier it becomes . Perhaps it the lack of research that went into Nicolas Cage 's character 's 'punk ' persona or just the cheesiness factor because it wa such a typical eighty film ... nonetheless it 's a cute love story with extremely funny , unique character . I think it 's right up there with `` Fast Times '' and `` Weird Science '' ( quintessential eighty flick ! )",1
"Watching this I mainly noticed the ad placement . DHL , Aquawhite Strips , Rockstar and more . It 's one product placement after another . It 's quite obvious how this movie got it funding . Jessica Simpson 's `` acting '' is laughable . Any Dick should n't ever get work because he play the same lame character . The `` story '' is just a backdrop for this very long commercial . I ca n't believe this movie wa even considered for theatrical release . The longer you watch this movie the more you 're embarrassed for everyone involved . The only minor saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook , who get almost no screen time a Jessica 's cousin . I 'm embarrassed I watched the whole thing . I would recommend avoiding this one .",0
"I 'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thriller ever made . The story take place in a fictional state , but obviously it deal with the murder of Kennedy . A truthful and honest district attorney ( played by Yves Montand ) doe not believe that the murder wa planned and executed by the single man Daslow ( =Oswald ) and though all other official want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team . The screenplay is written tight and fast and hold the tension till the end . Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authority is ( though not uninteresting ) a bit out of place . The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie .",1

Director James Signorelli ... Screenplay Sam Egan , John Paragon . Elvira , Mistress of the Dark wa an 80 's TV icon who had her own late night show on cable . She hosted and presented classic American horror film , many of them campy , while providing her own quip and humorous remark . Actress Cassandra Peterson ha to this date ridden on that success . In 1988 , her first film wa released . Playing herself , she 's stuck hosting monster movie show but longs for her own show in Las Vegas and make big money . Her agent Manny prof a disappointment . It 's not long before she inherits a mansion from a deceased relative , a pet dog and a book of recipe . She come to claim her inheritance in a small Nevada town - she wa on her way to Vegas and became lost - and soon stir thing up in the sedate community . Outspoken conservative town council woman Chastity Pariah ( Edie McClurg ) soon see her a a threat to the decency and value of the small town . Her voluptuous figure and winning personality soon draw the youth of the town . She fall for Bob Redding ( Daniel Greene ) the town handyman/carpenter , but before any real relationship can bloom , she find herself in deep trouble . Vincent Talbot ( William Morgan Sheppard ) an eerie older man who is also set to inherit part of the fortune of Elvira 's relative is in fact an age-old sorcerer who ha a personal vendetta against Elvira 's aunt and Elvira herself . He is aware that the so-called `` recipe book '' is actually a book of powerful magic , a power he wish to claim for himself . He scheme to bring down Elvira by having the town burn her at the stake . How will Elvira get out of this one ? The movie wa no real success at the box office , drawing a crowd of mostly young audience familiar with the Elvira show on cable . Truth be told , this is a funny and feel-good movie . The script is chalk full of all kind of joke , some bad , some good , lot of sexual innuendo , visual joke and overall campiness i.e . the hilarious last scene in which Elvira ha finally got her own strip show in Vegas . This film is a cult classic of sort , catering to Elvira fan . You could n't enjoy this film otherwise . It 's also a look back at `` pop '' culture of the 80 's . Elvira wa a much an icon of the 80 's a wa Alf , Vicky the Robot , Hulk Hogan , Mr. T and Madonna .",1
"After two long , long opening skit , one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free , we start the fast-forward fest that it GROOVE TUBE proper . Naturally , uber-stupid frat boy who still mainline JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube , SEX OLYMPICS ( I really do n't need to give you detail , do I ) , and a clown who basically doe the `` not very endearing clown '' bit I think I 've seen approxiately ninety time now will eat this up like dung beetle : well , more power to you . I just want to express that , despite what you 've heard , this movie wa in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movie like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what not . The skit movie had already been done in AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT , EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX , and so on . And done way better .",0
"This movie had lot of great actor and actress in it and it addressed some very noble issue . It 's full of emotion and the direction is done well . The storyline progress very quickly , but I guess that 's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie . This is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy .",1
"Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan 's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx , and what do you get ? You receive a series of kung fu fight and a lack of Magoo-like madness . The limited plot ha Magoo ( Leslie Nielsen ) put into an international plot , where he steal a world-renowned gem . Of course he ha no idea what he is doing . In fact , he ha no idea that he had the gem . Within thirty minute you could get very bored watching this . There are some very funny moment though like when he is cooking the chicken . You will wish that you were a nearsighted a Magoo . Its a fun movie to watch but it quite a disaster ! You have to love Leslie Nielson because he wa made some very funny movie . This is n't his best , but he doe a good job playing Magoo . I thought it wa a funny film , and it should be recommended to young child because they will probably think that it very funny .",0
"Alexandr `` Sascha '' Luzhin ( John Turturro ) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an Italy-hosted tournament . His brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess ha stunted his growth in all other aspect of his life . Natalia ( Emily Watson ) is a beautiful heiress who ha come to the same resort with her mother , Vera ( Geraldine James ) to scope out possible marriage partner . Vera lean toward a handsome count but , astonishingly , Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha , whom she met on a walk . Sascha , too , is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting . But , with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess match and , with other happening in his past still causing problem , will he win the heart of Natalia ? Oh , and can he become the chess champion , also ? This is a lovely film , based on a novel by Nabokov . The acting is amazing , with Watson very fine a the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro utter perfection a the shy , awkward chess enthusiast . James give quite a nice turn a the overbearing mother and the other cast member are wonderful a well . As for the look of the film , it could not be better . The scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety , the vintage costume are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause . Yes , the story is unusual and told with the use of flashback , at time , making it a film not everyone will appreciate . Then , too , the ending is bittersweet . However , if you love romance , period piece , great acting , knockout scenery , or the fine art of motion picture creation , do n't miss this one . You will be defenseless in resisting it multitude of charm .",1
"I bought this film on DVD despite the `` stale '' review and that wa idiotic ... That review wa completely accurate and I have never seen any worse `` erotic '' film in my long life ! Even if it partly wa lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings , plus a nice cover ... But my own Extreme Erotica ( c ) film are over 100 time more erotic ( just in the soft delicious aspect ) with probably le than 100 time of this film budget ! The story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book ... Or any new ( exciting ) element of slave training , except some very strange and sad development ... Then did the main male character - Klaus Kinski - not look a bit like the second Master of `` O '' he try to play ... And not even lovely Arielle Dombasle , did look delicious in any scene !",0
"This Film wa one that I have waited to see for some time . I wa glad to find it ha been everything anticipated . The writing of this film ha been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience . I found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important line but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant . The film ha many story and character woven together around this one Character Kilo , a Man whom ha rose from the street amidst many woe and become a very powerful criminal . After spending some time in Prison Kilo find a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of event is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems . Kilo Finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and Political royalty in order to make clear how important a Man 's Word is and stand for . A war begin a the street is in arm against Lords of wealth and corrupt Power . A build up to explosive and powerful non stop twist and turn . This film will leave you riveted . I found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a Movie to be ignored . Excellent . Go Rent It Today ! !",1
"In retrospect , the 1970s wa a golden era for the American cinema , a demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese . This IFC effort serf to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the career of these illustrious people seen in the documentary . The amazing body of work that remains , is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movie in that period . The decade wa marked by the end of the Viet Nam war and the turbulent finale of those year of Jimmy Carter 's presidency . One thing come out clear , film today do n't measure against the movie that came out during that creative decade because the industry , a a whole , ha changed dramatically . The big studio nowadays want to go to tame picture that will be instant hit without any consideration to content , or integrity , a long a the bottom line show million of dollar in revenue . The other thing that emerges after hearing some of America 's best creative mind speak , is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford it creator great moral and artistic reward . This documentary is a must see for all movie fan .",1
"The name ( Frau ) of the main character is the German word for `` Woman '' . I do n't know if that wa intentional or not , but if sure got some giggle from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year , when it wa shown . But those were the only giggle the movie got . Not that it wa aiming for giggle , it 's a horrible movie for heaven 's sake ! A horrible movie in more than one meaning . It 's a shame that a premise like that wa wasted with horrible even unbearable moment for the viewer ( definetely not for the faint of Heart ! ! ) ! And it wa n't even necessary to show all the thing that are shown . I 'm not even going into a moral obligation ( because movie do n't really have that kind of task or function ) discussion of what is shown here , but this is a new low on the whole `` torture movement '' that ha grown in the last few year !",0
"Ah , the classic genre of 80 sex comedy . This is set on two beach ; one a nude beach featuring myriad ( fully ) unclothed woman . The plot ? Something about a bunch of dimwit attempting to get laid . The usual . Fans of gratuitous T & A ( and P ) should hunt this one down .",0
"It 's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third . After the third that wa awful , it 's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new idea . Chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movie . Interesting the final that let know that a fifth can be done ....",1
"Yes , said title line doe actually appear in this movie . Why ? I 'm not sure . When the line wa actually being said , did n't somebody in the crew filming , at some point , laugh ? I would have liked to see the outtake from this movie , mostly because I think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself . Helmed by director Jim Gillespie , ( `` I Know What You Did Last Summer , '' ) come a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we have n't ever seen a teen slasher movie before . Of course , he 's not to be given all the blame . There are also three writer responsible , and this is somehow based on a video game that 's still in production . The title of said game is `` Backwater , '' but upon looking for information on it I came up with absolutely nothing . And so we begin the movie ... I would like to say before I continue that I wa n't expecting this to win an Oscar . When I am in the right mindset , I enjoy a fun horror movie to pas the time . I think there exists an opportunity for an effective , original , and smart slasher movie . `` Venom '' is not this movie . There is almost no character development at all . That 's fine . You do n't expect a whole lot . However , instead of a well-knit cast of a few , this movie decides to introduce u to the following many horror movie cliché character ... 1 . The Final Girl : She ha just broken up for her boyfriend . This mean that at some point in the movie when they are in peril , they will decide to get back together again . Which more than likely mean he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie . `` Eden '' is played by Agnes Bruckner , without much enthusiasm , I might add . 2 . The Boyfriend : He 's just around to co-exist with The Final Girl until his demise . Sure , he can save her , but he 's doomed and we know it . `` Eric '' is played by Jonathan Jackson . 3 . The Bimbos : Usually horror movie only feel the need for one of these , but here we have two . They shoplift , they steal , they might show their breast , ( not in this case , ) or they might possibly be alcoholic . A staple of the genre . They also wander around in dimly lit area all on their lonesome , usually saying thing like , `` Hello ? Is there anybody there ? '' `` Tammy '' and `` Patty , '' suitably named , are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood . 4 . The Jackass : Sure , he look pretty , but he 's the idiot in the movie that 's inserted purely to be an idiot . He say stupid thing , doe stupid thing , ha obviously never seen a horror movie , and is one of enjoyable kill you watch this kind of thing for . `` Sean '' is played by D.J . Cotrona . 5 . The Girlfriend : She love the Jackass even though pretty much nobody else doe , and she 's usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she start tripping and get left behind . `` Rachel '' is played by Laura Ramsey . 6 . The Creepy Janitor : In this case , The Creepy Gas Station Attendant . Enough said . `` Ray '' is played by Rick Cramer . I could continue , but I think you get the picture . The remaining character are n't so much common a they are equally killable . There 's `` The Gay Guy , '' ( Pawel Szajda a `` Ricky , '' ) who definitely got robbed a far a screen time is concerned , and `` The One Who Knows What 's Going On . '' Of course none of that matter , because at first everyone always think that one 's crazy . `` Cece '' is played by Meagan Good . There are a couple other character , namely a deputy played by Method Man , but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even le character development than the following clichés . So , you 're probably thinking , `` why doe this movie require such a deep analysis ? It 's just a summer horror flick , for cryin ' out loud ! '' Based on that question , doe it deliver the good ? Yes , and no . The acting is n't particularly convincing , even given the amount of talent involved . Bijou Phillips wa hailed for her performance in Larry Clark 's Bully , and Agnes Bruckner ha been an up-and-coming talent for a while now . So , what about the gore ? There 's some . That 's really about it . A lot of the juiciest bit are cut-aways . Namely a scene involving somebody 's face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from car . To the filmmaker 's credit , there are a couple interesting scene . I liked the bit where part of a house wa literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the character . If this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the character did n't make the same dumb mistake literally hundred of horror movie character had made before them , it might have made for a more enjoyable experience . All of the most interesting character are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a not-particularly-interesting countdown until we know it 's just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl . I suppose I must be a little jaded , but a a horror film fan , I 'm left wondering why I should have bothered when I could easily have written a better screenplay myself . I wo n't even mention the numerous instance of terrible CGI .",0
"The script wa VERY weak w/o enough character arc to make you care one bit about the character or what happens to them . The script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced . The story get to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die a quickly a possible so you do n't have to listen to them talk this very muted , stiff dialogue . On a technical note , the music mix is way to high and make it hard to understand what is being said most time . Then again , this could be called a blessing . Overall , this same story could have better been told in a short film w/ a running time under 30 minute . The obvious `` in your face '' homage to Sam Raimi and `` Evil Dead '' would have been good had they been more subtle , but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off . C'mon , this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best that could be done ? Still , the cinematography , lighting design and shot were very well done indeed .",0
"Pathetic ... worse than a bad made-for-TV movie . I ca n't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick . For some reason Morgan Freeman 's character is constantly talking about and saying `` pussy '' when referring to NSync boy 's girlfriend . Morgan Freeman calling woman `` pussy '' is just awkward ... What the hell were the people behind this film thinking ? Too many plot hole to imagine combined with the horrid acting , confusing camera angle , a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable . I rented this flop with low expectation .... but ... well ... it really sucked .",0
"Franco prof , once again , that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema . True , much of his work can be viewed a entertaining sleaze but with Succubus ( Necronomicon ) he show what he is truly capable of when he let his warped creativity run riot and give u a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work . Jerry Van Rooyen 's splendid score pulsates a the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another a we follow the trial of a striptease artist ( Reynaud ) who may be schizophrenic , or may indeed ( a one mysterious character state ) be a devil , attempt to come to term with the world she inhabits . A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema .",1
"Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actor , and director Kostas Karagiannis wa the man behind the successful Greek Giallo-esquire thriller Death Kiss in 1974 ; and yet when you combine the three talent , all you get is this complete load of drivel ! God only know what drove the like of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick , but I really do hope they were well paid a neither one deserves something a amateurish a this on their resume . The story focus on a group of devil worshipper that kidnap some kid , leading another group to go after them . The pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring . The plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this , and no doubt done much better . The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doe n't manage to overcome this at any point . This really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel . Extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended !",0
"Please do n't waste your time . This movie rehash the worst of Bram Stoker 's Dracula ( Van Helsing ) , Anne Rice 's Vampire Lestat ( rock music and silly biblical reference ) , and Blade ( high-tech toy ) . I really like vampire movie and novel , and there are many out there that are very good . But not this stinker . Not even the soundtrack help it , mostly because the movie resort to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the `` kick-ass metal '' some reported . Only a few time did I hear any metal ; mostly it wa tortured violin . Avoid it like garlic and crucifix .",0
"I have seen already fantastic story , but the premise of this one are so unbelievable that it come very close to being ridiculous . A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage , and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeon to kill him . Even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among ... say ... soul ? ... maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son . There is no shade of suspense or thrill , just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidence that can never happen in life . This is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director Joby Harold doe a decent job in directing a good team of actor that includes Hayden Christensen at his first major role after having taken off the Anakin Skywalker costume , fabulous Jessica Alba and super-gifted Lena Olin . All would have deserved a better story .",0
"That 's pretty ridiculous , I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the U.S , U.k , and all over the world . The religion ha over a billion follower . I Myself born and bread in America and through my religious class and teaching I have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society . I am very dedicated to the following and teaching of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world . I have know many Muslims from all over and I have traveled to country like Pakistan .. I have yet to meet one person who belief that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the medium ... I wonder why ... Also it sad that these extremist are the one the medium use to represent a whole religion . Its a religion of one billion people , and these are le than one percent , I am sure the other people of other religion would not like to be represented by the KKK , IRA and many more which are simple small percentage extremist who use outdated and not literal passage from the respected book in order to pursue their own revenge , personal , or business matter through their so called religion",0
"Despite a small handful of nicely executed scene , this entry ( the fourth ) feel tired . Toshiharu Ikeda , who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film , EVIL DEAD TRAP , show little enthusiasm for the stale premise . A miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot . Predictable stalking , harassing , assault and rape ensues . The staple of roman porno is sex . And sex mixed with violence . Both potentially exciting subject , to be sure , but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh . A masturbation scene in which a woman force pencil up her opening ( via condom ) is too little kink to late . The series ' rain motif continues and the film 's final scene brings relief .",0
"( This review is based on the English language version ) Orson Welles ' legendary unfinished epic wa just that - unfinished . It should have been left a such , not thrown together in this clumsy , boring compilation of whatever material wa available . While I 'm sure it wa done with the best of intention , the filmmaker have not only failed to do justice to Welles ' vision , they 've also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version upon audience . The first thing that strike the viewer is the amateurish quality of the audio . Not only are the newly dubbed voice rather poor performance , they 're also inconsistent - Welles ' original recording ( using his own voice , a he often did ) have been retained in a handful of scene , & they do n't match at all . There ha n't been the slightest attempt at consistency . Add to that an extremely empty sound mix which ha only a bare minimum of sound effect & atmos - a long sequence during a huge festival ( including the running of the bull ) sound like it wa recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the sound of a crowd that 's meant to be in the thousand . However , the real problem is the unavoidable fact that 'Don Quixote ' wa incomplete , & it 's glaringly obvious from watching this . The film consists of a handful of scene strung together & dragged out to ridiculous length just to make up the running time . Case in point - the sequence where Sancho search for Don Quixote in the city go on forever . It 's just Sancho approaching people in the crowd , asking them the same question over & over again - there is no way that Welles could ever have intended using every single take in it entirety , but that 's what appears here . It last over twelve minute , when , in fact , it would most likely have lasted about two minute absolute maximum in a proper finished version of the film . While the start of the film is relatively complete & rather well done , the rest ha massive hole which simply ca n't be filled with endless overlay of Spanish countryside & still more shot of Don Quixote & Sancho going back & forth . There 's also no ending . No resolution , no conclusion , no punchline , no point . Although there is material in private collection that wa unavailable to the filmmaker , that could n't possibly account for what would be required to make this into a complete , coherent work . Welles simply did n't complete shooting , largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finish . However , putting aside the fact that it wa n't complete , & never could be , one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that might have been would be enough . Unfortunately , by putting it all together in such a slipshod manner , one is left with a very negative impression of the film overall . In particular , what wa clearly a terrific performance from Akim Tamiroff a Sancho is utterly ruined with the new voice & with long , drawn out scene that eventually cause him to be simply irritating . Orson Welles ' vision for this film wa something far more ambitious & complex than a simple retelling of the story of Don Quixote , but that 's what ha been attempted here , & a such , the point is lost . The only person who could have assembled all the material into anything worthwhile would have been Welles himself , & he did n't . The footage could have been put to far better use in a documentary chronicling the whole saga of Welles trying to make the film . Welles himself even came up with the perfect title for such a doco : `` When Are You Going To Finish Don Quixote ? ''",0
Saw the move while in Paris in May 2006 ... I wa debating between that and mission impossible ... I am very glad I choose OSS 117 not only because it wa funny but might a well watch a FRench movie while in France . I had a great time ... would recommend it . It is important to have some understanding the French society of Today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... can not wait for the DVD to come out ... I do n't know how some of the 'jeu De mot ' 'puns ' would be translated in English I 'll certainly buy it when it is out ! P.S . I saw on 'BRice de Nice ' which is a movie starring Dujardin that all kid were talking about in France . this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine ... in comparing both movie I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117 .,1
"I saw this recently on a cable channel . The movie is great ; it 's one of the few musical I have seen that doe n't shy away from the light and dark . It portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor . Some of the set piece dance sequence so much is going on , I did n't know where to look next . One day I shall go and see this on the big screen , just so that I see what 's happening . But what really lift this to another level is Oliver Reed 's performance a Bill Sykes . Not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else , some inner demon . He gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner , he wa capable of anything . It wa almost a if the Sykes character wa on the edge of madness , just awaiting the trigger . I have seen the Robert Newton 's Bill Sykes from the 1948 movie , and I thought he wa 'just ' a bad egg , but Oliver Reed 's performance intimidated me in my own living room .",1
"LCDR Tom Dodge , despite having a reputation among submariner a a renegade and maverick ( * note to reader : Maverick doe not mean `` Tom Cruise '' . Maverick mean `` non-conformist '' . ) , is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet . The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friend the Russians hosting yard sale with their old diesel fleet . Countries like Lybia , North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hand on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport , Florida . And this wa 6-7 year before 9/11 . The Admiral assigns Dodge to assume command of a moth-balled WWII diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO , a top of the line fast attack sub . Dodge take command and in no time whip up the bad news bear .. err I mean his lovable group of oddball submariner into warrior . Despite having `` welcome aboard '' tattooed on his penis , he is a competent and fair commander , he doe not choose favorite and he delegate authority in a responsible manner . The US NAVY could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under-appreciated gem from the creator of `` Police Academy '' .",1
"What an awful adaptation . The worst part wa the music . Saxophone muzak and synthesizer playing in a story set in the early 1800 's ? ? ? ? ? ? The only character that did n't bore me to sleep wa Robert Hardy . I had to fight to keep my eye open on this one , and I love Jane Austen movie usually . I did n't even rent it , I borrowed it from the library . They should have paid me to take it . I do n't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another . Isabella and her brother were way overdone ; it wa no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the `` bad guy '' and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movie is the discovery that who you think is good , is n't . This is probably on my list of the ten worst movie I 've seen .",0
"The movie with it single set , minimal cast , and straightforward photography ( except for a couple of brief special effect ) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse drama so popular during TV 's early year . Nonetheless , the suspense hang heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino a she try to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kill her . And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan . He wa n't very versatile -- watching him essay comedy is almost painful . But no one wa better at wounded idealism ( On Dangerous Ground ) or the psychic pain of this movie . Few actor could express a much with their eye a this lean and towering figure . Lupino 's problem is that she 's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next . The suspense come from her various ploy to keep him happy while trying to escape . It 's a nail-biter all the way . This is not one of Lupino 's many fine `` soulful '' part that she wa so good at . Instead , it 's a role many lesser actress could have handled well enough . My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting . Ryan 's already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him . Then when Whiting walk in and find the attractive-looking Ryan scrubbing the floor , she start getting coy , flirting with her budding sexuality . Sensing trouble , Ryan abruptly fends her off -- finesse is not his strong suit . Insulted , Whiting attack his masculinity by calling his work `` woman 's work '' . That doe it . Up to that point he 's been courteous and professional with Lupino , trying to set himself on a normal path . But Whiting ha hit his raw nerve . Now there 's heck to pay a Whiting bounce out the door , leaving Lupino to pay the price . It 's a riveting scene , expertly done . Anyway , this is one of the dozen or so film produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audience were moving away from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacle . Too bad . What a hugely talented figure she wa both behind the camera and in front . She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much .",1
"This movie suffers from the fact that for year Hollywood had no clue a to how to package Jackie Chan for the mass . His low-budget Hong Kong movie were all fast-paced kinetic thriller that highlight his amazing gymnastic skill and talent for light comedy . His early Hollywood film stuck him in the same movie that were being packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris . There is nothing about Chan 's character in this movie that requires the character to be Asian except for his being the star . In his Hong Kong film Chan is never dull , with the movie being one rapid-fire martial art sequence after another , but `` The Protector '' is lifeless throughout . Danny Aiello is n't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actor got on together . Both have been better in worse movie . The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong setting . The worst part is the appalling way that Jackie Chan come off so colorless and drab . It would n't be until the made-in-Canada `` Rumble in the Bronx '' that the west would finally figure out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie .",0
"The premise sucked me in , but it wa clear about 30 second in that this wa either David Lynch or something seriously terrible . Interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list . I can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece ( Romero come to mind ) , but there wa nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one . The message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 ( or simply get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to ya ? ) and blindly follow the Bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we 'll trigger the second coming . It 's the kind of attitude that make people fly jumbo jet into 110 story building ( I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC ) . I like to think that God is a little greater than that .",0
"There wa some good build up of suspense throughout . The cinematography wa surprisingly good considering such minimal budget . We witness occasional spell of good acting , however , this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy line . Understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had , sitting up on tree while a crocodile is stalking you . Silence would have been golden here . There could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering , `` I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother ... '' Something tell me there 's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc . You decide . Throughout the film I ca n't seem to find a connection or for that matter , sympathy with the character , perhaps thats because they do n't develop one throughout the film , character that is . There are some occasional good scare when the crocodile sneak up on the character , overshadowed again by some questionable scene . In one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated , limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger . A definite roller coaster of a film when it come to logic .",0
"Super Troopers wa an instant classic . Club Dread , while disappointing to many , had it moment . Puddle Cruisers ha fewer moment . I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it wa made by the Broken Lizard group who made Super Troopers , so naturally I picked it up . I only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny . A far cry from Super Troopers . All in all , I wa very disappointed . I would not recommend this to anyone , unless you have an abundance of free time , and really need to kill some time . However , you 're better off playing video game , or watching something that might make you laugh or think .",0
"Yes , this review may contain spoiler , but you 'll thank me for it . This is the worst film I 've seen in quite some time . I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had , but inexplicably , there are several people who love this film and Spacey 's performance in particular . Some will chastise me for saying it , but I find Kevin Spacey 's acting quite limited despite the world 's admiration for him . I felt like I wa watching a meaner version of Kevin 's `` American Beauty '' role . His character in this film is ridiculously overacted , all the way down to his laughable insult he throw at his assistant . There are all-world trite and boring scene like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low . Somehow , I suspected this particular scene wa supposed to be funny , but by this time I wa ready to hit the stop button ( this is approximately 20 minute into the film ) . What about the faux-homage to `` Resevoir Dogs '' ? Whaley proclaims , `` I think I saw this in a movie once , '' a if he 's going to cut off Spacey 's ear . But what doe he use to cut him ? An envelope ! That 's right , he 's going to give him paper cut ! That ha to be one of Hollywood 's all-time worst scene , and the fact that the actor and director tried to carry it out with a straight face make it even more appalling . I will admit that I did n't see the end of this film ( my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end ) , but anyone who wish to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense . Well , I do n't care what happened in the end , because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue . I even got the feeling that the actor themselves wanted to get out of this film a bad a I did .",0
"Ordinarily , Anthony Mann made western with 'the big guy ' - James Stewart , Gary Cooper , Henry Fonda . . . the A list cowboy star . But in this B+ film , he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western . The main character , played by Victor Mature , is a trapper/ mountain man , and ordinarily they are romanticized in film - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson , that sort of thing , where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hang out with real mountain men . Not here . For once , a true mountain man - vulgar , crude , animalistic - is the central figure , and it 's something to see , giving Mature one of his better later role . The real acting chop are provided by Robert Preston , excellent a a self-absorbed Custer type cavalry commander , and James Whitmore , the poor man 's Spencer Tracy , a another of those old timer who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile Indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other . Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft a the officer 's wife , who is initially repulsed by the very sight of Mature 's grisly character , then find her own veneer of civilization slipping away a she begin to realize , to her own shock , that she 's attracted to him . Rarely if ever ha a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen , without the romantic allure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache . The battle sequence are big scale and notably violent , and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format . Good show , and underrated movie , all around .",1
"The movie 's storyline is pat and quaint . Two woman travel through the middle east and discover themselves . Unfortunately , if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central Asia this is absolutely terrible . The producer of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it . To begin with , and most glaringly incorrect , the Nuristanis , a they were known in the thirty , and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by Abdul-Rahman Shah of Aghnaistan , were not nomad . In fact they have not been nomad since the Aryan invasion of central Asia over three milenia ago . Second , the city that is filmed a Tehran is not Tehran , which is understandable , however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly DIFFERENT than the city of Tehran , which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range , which predominates all of the city view . Third , Persian , despite the fact it is spoken in Iran and Afghanistan , is never heard in movie . When there are native speaker who do not speak in German they speak in Arabic . The 'Persian ' guard at the border , in fact , say to each other 'Ma hadha rujal ' ( This is not a man ) and not 'in mard nist ' a it would be in Persian . Also , the love song between the Indian princess and one of the main character is obviously in Spanish . While talking in the garden one of the main character say that the Quran us the word 'Ferdos ' and 'jehaan ' and make some reference to drug afterwords . These word certainly never appear in the Quran a they are Persian for Paradise ( indeed , Ferdos and Paradise are very distant cognate between our language ) and 'World ' respectively , though Jehaan is admittedly close to 'Jehennan ' which is hell in Arabic . When they encounter the nomad in the desert the language spoken is also Arabic , this despite the fact that there are NO native speaker of Arabic in Iran and Afghanistan and it use is primarily religious , with some use in education at that time . When they are stopped in Iran before they reach the Afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any Iranian group . Their tent are typically bedouin with carpet decorating the wall and a high profile . In Iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear Turbans unless they are a cleric . The language spoken is clearly Arabic from the initial greeting of 'Ahlan wa Sahlan . ' When they do reach Kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy , totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid part of the Hindu Kush mountain range . There is an absence of the light green scrub that cover the ground in the summer and spring . The area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountain of the mountain range that won it name , The Indian Killers , because of it difficult and limiting ground . In short , the story line is the only thing in this movie that hold any water and it is still weak and common place . It lack any real draw to it , being merely the tale of two woman trying to learning about themselves a they get to Nuristan , however , even that is still-born and no real development is felt , leaving the character in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing ha changed except that world war two ha broken loose . In short , this is a really bad movie that I would have rated at one star except for the good footage of Bedouin and the desert of the Levant , even if they are misnamed .",0
"The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a laughable title , it 's so utterly misleading . It 's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead u though because this is one terrible movie . The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island . Very little happens in this film . And when something doe wake the viewer from his stupor , it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists . These guy are so bad they make the actor they deliver voice for appear like a group of remedial-level moron . It really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal . But the voice-artists can not be blamed for the script . It 's a travesty . Unintentionally funny at best , pathetic at worst . The story in general is , to say the least , uneven . The woman character are particularly idiotic ; the men are either creepy or tedious . The whole enterprise smack of pure exploitation of the audience . It doe n't remotely deliver what it promise and even when the murder ( finally ) start happening , they all occur off screen . All we get is a few half-hearted severed head shot . A few people have said that this movie is a giallo . I can not agree le with this opinion . Anyone who enjoys Italian thriller should give this movie a wide berth a there is nothing remotely thrilling about it . It 's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle . But it 's not very erotic either . I ca n't recommend this to anyone .",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed this film , which in many way , a Hitchcock did on several occasion , wa a first attempt at a plot which he re-shot later in his career . Possibly the most amazing thing about it , however , is how faceless the lead character are . After watching , one remembers Murray Alper a the jovial truck driver , Vaughan Glaser 's touching turn a a blind `` patriot '' , the unforgettable traveling Freak Show and of course Otto Kruger a the suave and sophisticated villain , all of whom completely overshadow Bob Cummings a the rather wooden fugitive ( compare that bridge jump to Harrison Ford 's similar stunt in Andrew Davis ' `` The Fugitive '' ) and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards Cummings is never quite believable . The other major support player is , of course , Hitchcock himself who bookend the film with 2 extraordinary stunt . Many people criticise the older film for their lack of realistic special effect . My feeling are that with lack of technology , to even attempt and convey what the director want to show is an amazing achievement . Obviously this film carry an anti-fascist message , made at the time of the Second World War , but being a Hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action . Well worth checking out , especially for the support role .",1
"Man , I really wanted to like these show . I am starving for some good television and I applaud TNT for providing these `` opportunites '' . But , sadly , I am in the minority I guess when it come to the Cinematic Stephen King . As brilliant a King 's writing is , the irony is that it simply doe n't translate well to the screen , big or small . With few exception ( very few ) , the King experience can not be filmed with the same impact that the story have when read . Many people would disagree with this , but I 'm sure that in their heart of heart they have to admit that the best filmed King story is but a pale memory of the one they read . The reason is simple . The average King story take place in the mind-scape of the character in the story . He give u glimpse of their inner thought , their emotion and their sometimes fractured or unreal point of view . In short , King take the reader place where you ca n't put a Panavision camera . As an audience watching the filmed King , we 're left with le than half the information than the reader ha access to . It 's not too far a stretch to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read , whereas One is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed . For a long a King writes , Hollywood will try shooting everything that come out of his word processor , without any regard to whether or not they should . I do n't blame the filmmaker for trying , but it take an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive Stephen King adaptation that work . The task is akin to turning lead into gold , or some arcane Zen mastery . Oh well , better luck next time .",0
"On the way back from IMC6 ( San Jose , California ) , all five ( mind you , three of u hardcore Kamal fan ) of u had reached a unanimous verdict ; VV wa solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up Monday . Not to mention , we swore to stay off the theatre for the next year . I wo n't blame Kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan ( on Vijay TV ) . He said something like , `` Tamizh Cinema'la Photography , Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay , Direction , Acting'la innum namba munnera'la '' ( Tamil Cinema ha grown in term of Photography and Editing , but we have hardly improved , when it come to Screenplay , Direction and Acting '' ) . While you 're watching VV , those word ring very true . Now , here are the 10 Reasons to hate this movie : 1 . Harris Jeyaraj 2 . Harris Jeyaraj 3 . Harris Jeyaraj I 'm barely holding myself from using expletive here , but fact is HJ ha mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his ( remember 'Anniyan ' , 'Ghajini ' ) with the jarring cacophony , he bill a background music . The next time I have an eardrum transplant , he 's paying for it . 4 . Songs Neither do the song help move the movie 's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice . The film feel like it 's made of four VERY long song with a few scene thrown in between them . 5 . A Short gone too far . VV at best is fit to be a short story , not a 2 hour plus `` thriller '' . To use a cliché here , like the Energizer bunny it go on and on and on ; only in this case you do n't want it to . The later part of a movie feel like a big drag . 6 . Kamal-Jothika pairing Two ice cube rubbed together could 've produced more spark than this lead pairing . There 's no reason you would root for them to make it together . In fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie , they make a good irritant to the narration . Hate to say this , but Kamalini Mukerjhee 's 10 minute romancing doe more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus 'Thenali ' . 7 . Kamal Haasan 's accent Kamal ha this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US ; and it is n't new either . He 's been doing it since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae ' . It 's simply get on the nerve . Imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meet shooting on location in the US . He doe n't leave it at the Immigration either , he offer dos of advice to his men ( bewildered TN Cops from Keeranor , Sathoor and beyond ) in chaste Kamanglish ( `` Wha we hav here is plain bad police wok '' ) , of course with nauseating effect . 8 . Logic There are a few director whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale . Gautam fails u badly with some crappy performance in the Department of common sense . Which D.C.P in his sens would meet his love interest on the street to discus such matter a committing himself and life after ! The scene inside the theatre wa so bad , towards the climax ; we could hear people behind u loudly challenge the Hero 's IQ . `` Is he stupid , ca n't he just use his Siren or Lights ? '' ( On a busy Madras road , Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-Jeep chase a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude ! ) . `` Ca n't he just use his gun ? '' ( `` The guy on a bike '' start on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time ) . I 'm not voting in favour of the later , but I 'm just trying to explain the mood inside . 9 . Gore & Violence If I wanted to watch woman being raped , their throat getting slashed , more woman getting raped and thrown into the bush with excruciating authenticity , I would sit at home and rather watch a `` Police Report '' or `` Kuttram '' . The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story , not overwhelm it ! Somewhere down the line Gautum seems confused about what the extension ( rape , murder ) are and what the mainstay ( story ) is ! 10 . Even a double shot Espresso could n't get the pain out of the head .",0
i completely agree with jamrom4 .. this wa the single most horrible movie i have ever seen .. holy crap it wa terrible .. i wa warned not to see it .. and foolishly i watched it anyway .. about 10 minute into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity .. but sat through until the end .. just to see if i could .. well i did and now i wish i had not .. it wa disgusting .. nothing happened and the ending wa all preachy .. no movie that bad ha the right to survive .. i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drive the bus .. if only i had heeded the same warning .. please save yourself from this movie .. i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie .. and should all be wiped off the face of the planet ..,0
"JESSICA : A GHOST STORY is a the name implies a ghost story . The theme is meant to be horror but come across closer to comedy ! A woman come who wa brutally murdered come back from the dead . This constitutes what this movie attempt to pas off a a plot . There is really nothing more to it . The movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scene involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death . Immediately from the opening scene , this movie ha the appearance of a `` straight-to-DVD '' effort . Unlike gem such a VACANCY 2 , the movie ha no sense of direction or creativity and certainly give `` straight-to-DVD '' movie a bad name ! The direction is a poor a can be with a complete lack of suspense , scare or tension . Even the drama element are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring . The acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career . Many of the individual scene are incredibly long , with very long pause between dialogue exchange . I 'm not exaggerating ! The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laugh . I stress the word `` few '' in that sentence . This is not overall one of the `` so-bad-it's-good '' movie like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE . If you want to laugh hysterically , watch those movie . If you want to see a proper horror movie about ghost watch THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE , THE CHANGELING , RINGU , THE EYE ( original Korean version ) , THE GRUDGE , ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE . I advise anyone who ha had the good fortune of avoiding seeing JESSICA : A GHOST STORY to keep up the good work ! Just forget this movie exists . Do n't spare a thought for it !",0
"I found the documentary entitled Fast , Cheap , and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary . The documentary contained four `` mini '' documentary about four interesting men . Each one of these men wa extremely involved with his job , showing sheer love and enjoyment for one 's job . The sad part , I must say , would have to be the subject in which these individual worked/studied . They were interesting for about five minute , afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long . The video wa filmed in a very creative way though . I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another . It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music .",0
"I got encouraged to watch this film because I 've heard good word of it : it wa supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone , disturbing , shocking ... all that jazz . Well , I am disturbed because I spent money on it , and I am shocked that something so God-awful actually got released . That 's about it . This is a supposed `` new look '' at Charles Manson 's family of insane loser junky and their murder . But if this is a `` new look '' then it 's probably `` new '' a in `` fresh and totally inept '' : just watching it gave me a headache and I had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be . I suppose I should say something about the plot but fact is , it wa so stupid and incoherent that I barely remember if there even WAS a plot at all . There wa something about a `` Manson tape '' delivered to a radio DJ ( or a TV producer ? ) , then an hour of pointless random footage of `` the family '' in '69 , then the Polanski murder ( looking like a bad school play ) and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinhead getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley ( I kid you not ) , and then it ended ( thank God ) ( Do n't ask me to make any sense of that , I 'm just recalling what I saw ! ) The performance were terrible , too . And how difficult is it to make a convincing `` Manson '' ? Get a short skinny scrawny bloke , put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him . There 's your Manson . But this `` Manson '' doe n't even look right . He just look like , uh , a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on Santa beard painted black . Or maybe that 's what this film is actually about : Manson 's family did n't make any sense , so this film doe n't make any sense , either . It 's symbolic ! ( Yeah , right ) I 'm still so angry at spending money on this I stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage . Stay away from it , it 's not even worth renting . PS . The recent US TV production `` Helter Skelter '' got bad review here but I saw it last month ( I saw the 1976 original too ) and let me tell you , compared to `` Manson Family '' , that new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS . And I wa disappointed in it ! That 's how bad `` Manson Family '' is : it make a flawed and mostly disappointing TV movie look perfect .",0
"Just two comment .... SEVEN year apart ? Hardly evidence of the film 's relentless pulling-power ! As ha been mentioned , the low-budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in it limited appeal . Having said that however the thing is not without merit - either a entertainment or a a fright outing per se . True , the plot at it most basic is a re-working of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror . More a case of intrigue ! Gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played Halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murder with the `` house '' a the main suspect . The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard . It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moment . Having picked the DVD up for a mere $ 3.95 last week at my regular video store , I can not begrudge the expenditure . $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film . Just do n't expect firework !",1
"This Filmfour funded Sci-Fi movie is most definitely a must see . While it take huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and offer nothing new or original plot wise ; it 's handled with the utmost skill that it come off a being fresh and inventive , despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film . It 's good to know that film like this are still being made ( even if they are n't getting wide release ) , and Cypher is refreshing for that reason . The plot twist and turn , which give it an element of paranoia and also serf in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher 's mystery . The plot follows Morgan Sullivan ; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speech from several rival company and recording them for reason , to him , unknown . However , his job is interrupted when he meet a mysterious young lady known a Rita ... This film feature a number of stark white background that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it 's apocalyptic imaging of the future . This give the film a very odd look that set it apart from the majority of other film of the same type , with it 's only real close affiliate being Kubrick 's A Clockwork Orange . The plot is also very efficient and ditch character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing . You never quite know where you are with the plot , which serf in making it all the more intriguing . The acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of star ; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui . Northam very much look the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale , and doe well with his role . Lucy Lui is an actress that ha a resume that doe n't quite fit her talent , but she ha a look about her that just fit this movie . Cypher is far from perfect a some of the sequence are illogical and at time it can be inconsistent ; but on the whole , if you want an inventive recent Sci-Fi film ; Cypher is the way to go .",1
"Any one who ha seen Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ and wa bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead . Though it wa n't a success in th box office or TV rating , The Fox Movie Channel still find a real good motive to show this anually . I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciple to sing in Hebrew.Though Sarandon did n't have long hair like any other Jesus would in other film , his look are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear . What surprised me or startled me wa the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate `` And do n't ever forget , that you are a Jew ! '' Though that may have not been a racist remark , Colin Blakely wa trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eye of the prominent men of those days.Keith Michell 's portrayal of Pilate wa hulking , comparing with his previous performance in `` The Story of Jacob and Joseph '' and `` The Story of David '' . But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savala 's or Hurd Hatfield , you can say that he really painted well the impression of a Roman procurator .",1
"When I wa young , I wa a big fan of the Naked Gun movie but just recently I watched the show Police Sqaud ! and I think it great ! Leslie Nielson 's awesome , Alan North is cool , and who the heck is Rex Hamilton ? But anyways , it 's one goofy show . One of my favorite part of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credit . I think my favorite one is when Norberg ( not O.J . ) walk in during the scene and he try to fit in with the freeze frame . Classic ! The only problem to me is the cigarette gag get very old ( when Drebin show a cigarette to someone and asks , `` Cigarette ? '' and the person reply , `` Yes . I know . '' ) I think they used it too many time by whatever . Good acting , good gag , great show ! 7/10",1
"within about 5 minute in to the film the first fight scene i wa watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the camera crossing back and forth really show he had no idea what he wa doing , well actually the soundtrack show that the best . i no it a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 song but at least get music that go with the scene that is n't actually that hard acting , well if i saw any i would gladly let you know . the script wa so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of beep , i will give the person one 10/10 and that wa for the DVD cover because if i actually saw `` before watching this '' in a shop and it wa like 10 15 buck i would have bought it , why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it ha actually won award . now that is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival i would n't ever believe in my life that this would win anything all i can say is `` wow if this wa the best i would n't want to know what the crap in the film festival wa like '' film that are this bad only have one good use and that is for a aspiring film maker to use a inspiration film like this are better tool then good film , because with good film you almost know off the bat there is a good chance you wont make a film that good , but if you use a film like this you can look at all the thing they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistake , and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if a piece of beep like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there",0

"My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven year , not to mention shared an office with him . When it wa announced he wa BTK , she wa shocked . The whole day wa just her telling story about how she never would have seen him a the Wichita Killer . I 've heard her re-tell them many time . I 've inquired her about a lot of thing , and gone to all the interview that she wa asked to go to . I 've read the entire book written about Raider , Wichita is my hometown and I wa surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas . There wa another BTK movie on TV not too long ago , and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis ' killing , maybe even have some intelligent touch to his motif . I 'm going to be very blunt with the flaw in this movie . This is based on my mom 's portrayal of him , all my reading on him , and the video tape I 've seen of him talking . First of all , the camera angle were horrible . It looked a though it had been shot on a home video camera . The acting wa terrible and I could n't even bear to watch it . Dennis Raider never had long hair . Dennis Raider wa a `` very anal man '' and wa a `` follow the rule book '' kind of guy . He wa n't a nice a the movie made him look , he wa very polite and abrupt , business like . Same go for his killing , a far a we all know . If you 've seen his confession in court , you can already guess . And a for the obsession with the slaughter house ? No . Never have I read or ha Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bug . In fact , he practiced on cat and dog for choking method . Yet through-out the whole movie he wa putting animal in his victim 's face and acting like he cared about the well-being of them . Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew , he confessed this , but in the movie in his first killing he tell the lady he know her also . I really do n't even want to go in to this movie , and I 'm already ranting . This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happening of BTK . This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie . If you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scene served the side , then this is your kind of movie .",0
"If you thought that the original from 83 wa bad then try out this modern day masterpiece . How could it be worse more you ask ? Well ... at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sport bra . Other than updated graphic , modern day theme ( such a terrorist ) , modern weapon and a sexy new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story . Anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story wa going . And for anyone that did n't see the first one ... well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once . Maybe in another 23 year Hollywood will try again .",0
"Haunted Boat sell itself a 'The Fog ' meet 'Open Water ' . In many way this is accurate . There are scare and weird looking people to keep you interested . However the acting ability is poor at best . Showing clear sign that this is merely a bunch of friend making a horror film . Which in all credit they do to the best of their ability . When you accept the low budget make it very difficult for special effect , with the ghost looking pretty much like men with rubber mask on . Many aspect of the film are creepy and strange . But it suffers for using too many twist and turn in a short space of time which just leaf you bored and confused . In term of keeping you awake the film doe it very well . Ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 second near the end , you actually want to know what is going on . And are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minute for the climax . This is no Ghost Ship but it 'll definitely do for an evening in front of the T.V .",0
"I rented this type of `` soft core '' before , but I can honestly say , I wa n't expecting this to be in the same type a `` Rod Steele : You Only Live Until You Die '' -- which wa both sexy AND funny . It had a good script , a sincere leading man , and a sense of purpose . It also ha Gabriella Hall who is hot . The reason why I did n't expect this movie , wa because the box wa missing the `` Must be 18 to Rent '' Sticker . I wa looking for more `` cheese '' and le `` cheesecake . '' First of all , I think movie should n't be allowed to start with `` actor '' rehearsing for a part at a talent agency ( or wherever `` actor '' rehearse ) . In this movie seeing the `` actor '' rehearsing highlight the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real character in the movie . Okay , having found out that this WAS a soft core movie , I did n't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back . But , the dizzying way the extended video `` erotic '' scene are added to what wa probably a late night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to fast-forward through without the sustained quality of , say , Rod Steele . You know they must 've had some money , because I think some of it is filmed overseas . I will have to say the main actor trying NOT to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting job I 've ever seen . And , I 've seen Torgo from Manos ! It may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee ( that and Gabriella Hall ) . Still , there are better corny movie to rent with your friend .",0
"I watched this movie based on the comment of a few that said that is wa bad but funny . But you need to be warned that this movie ha the worst special effect ever produced . They make 1950s science fiction movie look like work of art . This is funny at time , but annoying for the most part . And to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effect is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the event depicted . One of my favorite is where three of the character drop hundred of foot into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit . Apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid . Very impressive . But this is just one example . And for what it worth , the music suck , the acting suck , the two cute girl are annoying , the obnoxious guy is annoying , the so-called handsome lead man is a geek , and the black girl who fall for him is a fool . Her father is the worst actor I have ever seen . I am not sure the brief moment of humor can possibly make up for the experience .",0
"I must say : out of all modern korean martial art movie this one is worth checking out . It wa n't a epic a Musa-The Warriors and did n't develop the character a well , but it had many nice idea . Simple story : a elite soldier thought dead , return after year to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval day . His counterpart wa formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him . The fight scene are all with sword or different weapon and very entertaining to watch . The motif of the figure are discovered first near to the end . You might need to watch it again to get all the connection right . And me personally ... I loved the end . I could watch it over and over again . Maybe a little pathetic , but a real freedom fighter story .... People can be killed , but not the idea they stand for ....",1
"This is a movie that play to everyone 's emotion . We all want a second chance at thing . Jim Morris got one , followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream . What a great message and what a great delivery by this movie .",1
"`` Zu : The warrior from magic mountain '' wa and is an impressive classic ! You never would have guessed it wa made in 1983 . Tsui Hark 's use of special effect wa very creative and inventive . ( He continued doing this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later production . ) Even now it can measure up to other movie in this genre . `` Legend of Zu '' is connected to `` Zu '' warrior from magic mountain '' ! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one . The plot is a bit hard to follow . But to be honest it doe n't matter . It is all about the action and adventure ! I always wa wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hand on CGI . Now we know , he made this movie . Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that . There is so much happening on the screen , you simply wo n't believe ! I think it is a big shame that this movie wa n't shown in theater here in Holland . Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinema ! This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood production like `` Superman Returns '' or Xmen 3 . The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor ! In most of Tsui Harks 's movie he combine drama , fantasy , martial art and humor . Somehow it is missing in this movie . Again I am not going to be picky about these small matter . `` Legend of Zu '' delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effect you will see . A true classic !",1
"One of my favorite show in the 80 's . After the first season , it started going downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast . Deborah Pratt wa wonderful and it wa fun watching her and Ernest Borgnine 's character go at it with each other . The last episode she appeared in wa one of my favorite for in the second season . Unfortunately during those day , black did not last long on television show . Some of the episode in the second season where okay but the third season it wa more about the human character than Airwolf and it wa not shown until almost at the end of the show . When it went to USA , it wa disgusting ! ! !",1
"I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie . But I had no Idea what I wa getting myself into . I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture . I finally know what hell is like . It 's this movie . For eternity . This movie ha no value . It did n't even really have a plot . There wa stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens . Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff a many bullet in it a you can . You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie . Do n't even watch it . Not even to see how bad it is . I beg you . If you watch it , then it mean they win .",0
"After we counted the use of the f word , oh , about 22 time in the first 10 minute or so of the film , listened to some really bad actor going on about a woman and a horse , and pretty much acting like 12 year old boy being naughty together , well , we turned it off . Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie , the product of unimaginative and no-talent writer . We did give it a second chance , thinking surely it would get better . No dice . Later , my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved , still no dice . The main character did have a cool bike . I would n't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescent , or frat boy .",0
"A real head scratcher of a film by Bill Rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighty . Three crackpot millionaire invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $ 1 million provided he or she make it that far . A series of lame prank are pulled on some of the guest while the others engage in what most adult would do under the circumstance namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar . Most scene are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body part including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meet geriatric aerobics complete with hooker . If there wa any hesitation that white people ca n't dance this scene hammer the final nail in that coffin . Pay close attention for the nipple slip . This continues on for about forty-five minute until Bill Rebane begin throwing dart at various plot twist and whatever he hit becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess . It 's a game until it 's not a game . The three old coot are in complete control until they 're not . The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just prop . They 're dead until they 're not . Even the narrator at the end reply that he doe n't know what the hell happened . I defy anyone to reason where Rebane wa going on this one . The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner . Most of the actor probably went back to their day job at the local Stuckey 's . I give it a few point for the scene where the yuppie broad open the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself . Let 's see Gone With the Wind do that ! This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me . Bane , Get it ! Like Rebane ! I hate myself .",0

"Komodo vs. Cobra start a 'One Planet ' environmentalist Jerry Ryan ( Ryan McTavish ) & his girlfriend Carrie ( Renee Talbert ) hire Captain Michael Stoddard ( executive producer Michael Paré ) to take them to an island in the South Pacific , at first Stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon change his mind when a load of cash is offered . Along with TV news reporter Sandra Crescent ( Jeri Manthey ) they set sail for the island & once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal DNA genetic experiment which have resulted in huge Komodo Dragon 's & King Cobra 's that have eaten almost every other living thing there & Stoddard & co are next on the menu ... Co-written & directed by the ever awful Jim Wynorski under his Jay Andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful , this is just plain hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual rubbish 'Creature Features ' the Sci-Fi Channel have the nerve to air if that 's possible . The script is terrible , predictable & utterly boring , some giant monster of some sort are created by scientist messing around with DNA , a group of people are trapped with said monster & have to try to escape being eaten . That 's it , that 's the whole plot of Komodo vs. Cobra , maybe this wa trying to rip-off AVP : Alien v . Predator ( 2004 ) with the title but all the 'vs . ' bit amount to is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beast at the very end , boring a hell & surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash . The character 's are poor , the dialogue is awful , the pace is slow , the story is predictable & cliché ridden & the whole film just suck really with a lazy script that state wrongly that both Komodo Dragon 's & Cobra 's are amphibious which they are not . Hell , Komodo vs. Cobra is n't even worth watching for any unintentional laugh since it 's so dull & hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the Cobra is quite funny for the wrong reason . How doe Wynorski keep getting directing job ? He is probably consistently the worst director currently working , how can he keep getting fun sounding film set on beautiful location with half decent cast & still churn out such an awful film ? I think this wa cut to get a PG or for it 's TV showing since every time someone swears it 's masked by a Parrot squeak ! There 's zero gore or violence & the monster scene are limp , people just sort of stand there , the monster just sort of stand there too hissing or roaring & that 's about it . The CGI computer effect are terrible , this is really poor stuff that just look horrible . With a supposed budget of about $ 450,000 this look a cheap a it wa , the Hawaiian location are nice to look at but that 's about it . The acting is poor from an uninterested looking cast . Komodo vs. Cobra is an absolutely terrible Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature ' from Jim Wynorski , film do n't get much worse than this .",0
"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ! The Decline of Western Civilization ...... what a great title eh ? And of coarse a great movie . This is the best concert film I have ever seen . A close second being the Talking Heads movie `` Stop Making Sense '' . I first heard of this movie when Waynes World came out in 1992 . I looked at the director 's name Penelope Spheeris and thought cool name , what else ha he directed ? I thought the first name wa pronounced like envelope . After some time looking in movie guide I came across the critically acclaimed Decline and realized Penelope wa a woman ..... my Mom corrected me . I spent 8 year of my life trying to track this down . I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver , where I currently reside . It wa worth the wait . This capture the LA punk movement very well . This is teen angst at it 's best folk . My favourite is the band the Germs who need subtitle for the lyric because Darby Crash sings so crazy , you can not understand it . I laughed when I saw this . The band Black Flag live in an abandoned church and the band X are a very intelligent bunch . Also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to Slash Magazine about how we do not need to save the whale , there are countless mile of ocean for u to pour toxin in ! I became a huge Penelope Spheeris fan after this , and saw all her punk movies-Dudes wa OK , and Suburbia is a cult classic ! I own both of these on VHS . She is a true underground film maker and I love her stuff . I would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge wa so popular . I wa a big Nirvana fan then , but ala I saw this in 2002 and by that point I had grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method/Fatboy Slim . Quite a change of pace , I know , but what can you do ? But if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this capture it better than anything . Much better than 1991 : The Year Punk Broke . This is a tough movie to track down , but if you get your hand on it , rent it , even if you do n't like the music it is an excellent piece of work . Now day it might be easier to find with DVD 's being so popular . By the way Penelope produced a little known Albert Brooks movie called `` Real Life '' which I also own . Very funny stuff in today reality TV craptacular ! Rent Decline ...... Highly recommended ! Thanks !",1
"I do n't have much to say about this movie . It could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for Peter Sellers , but it is one of the most tragic misfire in movie history . That it wa Sellers final movie make it all the more painful . The terrible screenplay , direction and shockingly wooden performance all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movie ever made . I wish so much that I could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber , but it 's a lifeless , humorless disaster . The truth hurt . Peter , why could n't you have stopped at BEING THERE ?",0
"Remember the wooden , undramatic literary adaptation of the 1970s at their worst ? You will when you see this broadly acted , unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolate-box adaptation . Most culpable of all is Catherine Z-J who , while undeniably easy on the eye , substitute swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance . Played po-faced like a melodrama , or Cold Comfort Farm without the joke , this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who miss entirely the novel 's sense of irony or tragedy . A shame , given the quality of the acting talent on offer - Joan Plowright , Claire Skinner , Steven Macintosh all deserve better than this .",0
"Obviously , the comment above that fawn over the movie were made by someone who 's on the crew . I do n't recall ever seeing a movie that 's more insulting to the talented actor or the audience watching . In my 30 year of watching movie , this is the only one I have ever walked out of . Bad humor , bad joke , bad gag , bad editing , bad plot , etc . Note to producer : It 's never funny to hunt human based on race . Great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all race , but you 're still hunting human based on race , and that 's sickening .",0
"best movie ever ! ! ! ! ! this movie broke my rib just by the force of laughter , but it wa well worth it . i do n't intend to do a summary of this excellent movie , just go see it if you have the chance . i think you will either love it , or hate it . that 's the quality of a real cult movie .",1
"Oh , how we have a misfire here ; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other thing a it waste your time with brain numbingly poor production value ; character stereotype of the worst and racist kind since D.W. Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms a 'the yellow man ' ; character so unimaginative and un-engaging that it 's difficult to watch a well a a narrative that plod along at such a slow , stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film . Prizzi 's Honor is a film that end up being an absolute post-modern disaster in every which way possible . The film is a messy and senseless disaster that ha John Huston directing ; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gap a either dumb stereotype or supporting character that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character . Prizzi 's Honor is a film that fall into a genre of neo-noir , comedy , romance , action , gangster and overall crime  this twinned with it director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story ; some sort of a sequence of good scene ; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all . I 'll give a couple of example of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is . Firstly , the film think it 's a love story and it think this for about an hour of it time : of MY time . Charley Partanna ( Nicholson ) is an assassin who kill people for a family that he work for in New York and yet he resembles his character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest more than an international hit-man . He meet and fall in love with Irene Walker ( Turner ) who is another assassin and they hit it off but a the poor excuse for a plot play out , it appears all is not right . I read that the plot for this film is : `` A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love , only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other . '' Well , yes that 's true but that actual revelation doe n't happen until about twenty minute to the end ! Nicholson play Partanna like someone with an IQ of 60 : he walk around ; seemingly making observation and talking out loud about thing he see ; he talk like he is either drunk or ha a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on ( that actually happens off screen ) is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard-bodied , best of the best , international hit-man . So with a main character who is un-likable and un-realistic , we move to the script . The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest trace of life merely poor convention : Partanna slouch around on the phone or in person asking the same thing over and over again : `` Do I marry her ? ; Do I love her ? What is love ? What do I do ? '' and it get so repetitive , it 's not even able to act a good humour . This twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone : a girl called Maerose Prizzi ( Huston ) played by director John 's daughter ; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laugh a wa the scene in which she tell her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it  that got me thinking , wa this supposed to be funny ? Should I be laughing ? The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with it opening scene of a wedding ( alá The Godfather ) and consequential scene with a touch of noir a gangster , police men and assassin were introduced into the film . But what we get is something very , very different . The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot ; right , the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kick-start . I wa so very wrong : with more character continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way , we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office : this scene sum the film up . Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just make it look cheesy . We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music ; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevator ; maybe they have to be careful of civilian when they hide in their chosen place and when that random woman step out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene is n't even edited correctly . Some suspense , some drama : `` Do I shoot or do n't I ? `` ; maybe some slow motion a the character ha to quick draw before it 's too late  anything but how it wa actually executed . Prizzi 's Honor continues it monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion a it nears it climax . It 's a film where camera reflect in window ; light reflect in side of car and 'dead ' chauffeur blink when nudged . Prizzi 's Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patient of any film-goer and do n't say it wa a comedy because I did n't laugh with it  AT it is another matter . The film is repetitive , drawn out and colourless in it vision and scope for originality - there is no Honour here .",0
"The original movie ( dated 19 ? ? ) did not show any `` monster '' , it just SUGGESTED scary `` thing '' , . This version however show every aspect of a `` sick minded ghost '' , including unnecessary special effect . The `` mystery `` , a presented in the original movie , wa the most scary part : one simply did not know what wa causing the weird thing that happened . By showing the face of the `` old man '' , this Mister ha completely disappeared . Even worse : the special effect ( cry wooden child face ) is ridiculous . This is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close a scary a the original",0
"`` Hero and the Terror '' is a fairly dull thriller - a la : no real character substance , predictable plot , and ... Boring . For a thriller I found this movie slow in working up to it pitiful climax , a it just seemed to drag along until Chuck 's wife 's baby is born ... and then it drag on from there until it reach the end - which I can hardly remember already even though I only saw the film 10 minute ago . I give this film 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minute .",0
"Fellowe 's drama about a couple 's marriage which is threatened by a younger third party which interest the wife of the house ( Watson ) . Wilkinson play the role very well a the troubled husband who cant control his wife 's cheating , and deal with the issue . I also like Rupert everett a lot in his role a William Bule , the man that Watson ha the affair with . Although i think Emily Watson is a great actress , i had a bit of a problem with the way her character wa written , did not make her too likable ( i know a cheater is not supposed to be likable , but some of her action and thing she did had no reasoning behind them ) . The screenplay wa perhaps the weak part of this drama , although Fellowes ' direction wa good and the performance were also quite good . This film is better than Unfaithful , but not a masterpiece by any mean . -- -IMDB Rating : 6.7 , my rating : 8/10",1
"An angry boy who ha tragically lost his parent is looked after by his grandfather . Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tale which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islander . Although tragic episode , such a the Highland clearance , feature in the story , there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them . It 's all filmed in Skye , so there is a double dose of beauty . The mountain scenery is breathtaking , and it 's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken . I 'm English , so I had to read the subtitle , but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful . The performance are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other word , you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history . The Gaelic community , especially on Skye , worked innumerable minor miracle to make this film . Anyone who ha the slightest interest in Gaelic , folk history , folk music , oral culture , Scotland , British history , multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film .",1
"There is absolutely NO reason to waste your time with this `` film '' . The original said it all and still hold up . Either read the book or do some research about the story , and you 'll realize this remake is ludicrous . Eric Roberts a Perry Smith ? His sister could have done a better job ! Having been to Holcomb & Edgerton , KS where the story take place , the set and location looked NOTHING like Kansas . The original is riveting , from the location filming to the use of the actual participant , weapon and victim belonging . Unforgettable performance by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake . Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall ... The original is available on DVD in widescreen now . Let this turkey die a quick death .",0
"As far a cinematography go , this film wa pretty good for the mid 50 's . There were a few time that the lighting wa way too hot but the shot were generally in frame and stayed in focus . The acting wa above average for a low budget stinker but the direction wa horrible . Several scene were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effect were non-existent . The attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull wa obvious with stick poke and string . I also could n't help but think the budget did n't allow them to furnish the house so they kept making reference to the mover and that all the thing in storage should be coming soon . Honestly ... it would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie . It wa n't bad enough to be a `` good-bad '' movie but wa n't good enough to be `` good '' either . Get the MST3K version ... it 's more fun .",0
My favourite police series of all time turn to a TV-film . Does it work ? Yes . Gee run for mayor and get shot . The Homicide `` hall of fame '' turn up . Pembleton and nearly all of the cop who ever played in this series . A lot of flashback help you who hasn´t seen the TV-series but it amuses the fan too . The last five minute solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cop turn up . And a short appearance from my favourite coroner Juliana Cox . This is a good film .,1
"Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movie . But that 's because it did n't have the FUNDING those movie had . Obviously , whenever you want to produce a story such a this one , focusing on African American historical involvement ( and NO , servant and 'mammies ' are not historical involvement ) , Hollywood is n't going to be too supportive . And believe me they were n't . The producer and actor sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket ' expense to make `` Posse '' , just so that the story could be told . I think that alone is commendable . Posse may not be Oscar material ( and they do n't like Black medium too much either ) , but it is a start . It is entertaining , and it introduces u to the black cowboy , a character most of u are unfamiliar with .",1
I must say that I am fairly disappointed by this `` horror '' movie . I did not get scared even once while watching it . It also is not very suspenseful either .... I wa able to guess the ending half way through the movie ... So .. what 's left ? `` The Ring '' is a trully scary movie ... I wish other movie would stop copying from it ( e.g . the trade-mark : long hair ) . Please give me some originality . Will not recommend this movie .,0
"I truly enjoyed this film . It 's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspect of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job a well . In this film you find two star who rise to the occasion . Both woman deliver warm , touching and at time humorous performance . The film also touched on a number of topic , from racial issue to sexual identity . And yet the approach wa n't heavy handed . The production value were also top notch for a small budget film . I saw this at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time . It wa a real crowd pleaser . Everyone I spoke to seemed to enjoy this film .",1
"Lucio Fulci made a lot of great film throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore ' . While Do n't Torture a Duckling wa made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds , and is n't all that gory ; it 's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller , and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made ! Do n't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulder above a lot of the Giallo genre in term of production value and unlike many of Fulci 's later film , everything about this Giallo is great . The plot focus on a small rustic community where dead body have began turning up . The murder are even more shocking because the victim are just young boy . Shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crime , a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murder on his own . Martelli soon encounter various suspect , including a sexy young lady named Patricia , a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigy and sticking pin into them . While this film may not feature load of gore , it doe have two of Fulci 's nastiest sequence to make up for it . The nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery , while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rock on the way down is liable to turn some stomach . Do n't Torture a Duckling feature an absolutely great Italian cast . Barbara Bouchet ( a personal favourite of mine ) is incredibly sexy in her role a Patricia , and get to flex her acting muscle more than she did in many later film . Tomas Millian is excellent a usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by like of Irene Pappas , Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel . The cinematography on display is stunning and Fulci really give the viewer the impression that he put a lot of care and effort into every scene . The story play out slowly , and it 's always interesting a Fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line . There is n't a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer ; but Fulci almost manages to keep u guessing right up until the end and Do n't Torture a Duckling doe climax on a high . Overall , it 's a shame that Fulci did n't make more film like this . Do n't Torture a Duckling is his out and out best work and I insist that every Giallo fan see it !",1
"This could have been a good biopic , but what a mess ! I had this film when I wa a theater manager . When I put the film together , and watched it , I thought I had some reel out of order . As it turned out I did n't , and if I did , nobody would have noticed . I could n't figure out what 's going on ! Everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way !",0
"The White Warrior is definitely one of , if not Steve Reeves weakest film . Set in 18th or 19th century Russia ( ? ? ) Steve play a cossack warrior who try to over run a mad man Russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking Russian white tunic ..... For the most part the great Reeves physique is hidden in a goofy , knee length tunic , with an even more sillier looking russian hat . The action is rather minimal , with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that show off the great Reeves physique . This is an apparent attempt by the producer to move Reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era , with poor result . The dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various point , and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene . I would image Reeves regretted making this film , but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandal and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic character such a Morgan the Pirate and the Thief of Baghdad .",0
"If the maker of Atlantis had something to say in this film , it theme wa ( literally ) drowned out by the emphasis on `` special effect '' over characterization . Almost a if in an attempt to `` keep up '' with the rest of the summer action blockbuster , Disney ha ditched the character-driven , movie-with-a-message approach in favor of a Star Wars `` shoot-'em-up '' with stereotype hero and villain . The art is cartoony and the producer think that they can rely on computer generated image ( CGI ) of flying fish-craft and submarine to fill the gap . They are wrong , and the day of beautiful , handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly-line CGI . This movie is all spectacle with no heart . At time the film come close to being a good , worthwhile movie , but frustratingly miss the mark so many time by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz . Another problem with the movie is the pacing . It start confusingly and then begin to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated . The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch ( voiced well by Michael J . Fox ) and is left thinking `` Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that 's going to happen once we get to Atlantis '' . Unfortunately , not much happens . The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent . They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is , even in a fictional story . Is it in the Atlantic ? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea ? Who know ? Nothing is hypothesized , even from a purely fantasy-based point of view . The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves `` Now what wa that all about ? What wa the point of the movie ? Why could n't the surviving Atlantean 's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the `` present '' day ? And WHY did Atlantis sink ? '' and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw . There is nothing left to think about or mill over ... except the loss of money in their wallet . The character and their motivation are equally unfathomable . From the eccentric zillionaire who found the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914 , to the ( spoiler ) collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY desert it people ! ? ! The crew are a collection of quirky , 2-dimensional people of anachronistically ( for 1914 ) P.C . race and gender . The demolition expert talk like he came right out of a Warner Brothers ' Bugs Bunny short . Most of the joke are gross one-liner that are largely missed by the audience for two reason : They are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled . The way these supporting player do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe . While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movie for adult - and this is the first Disney not to have cute , talking animal or object - it fails to make the transition . Younger child will be frightened by some of the action scene and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitle ( when the character speak Atlantean ) . In the first five minute of the expedition , approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought . Obviously Disney think that if you did n't know who those people were , then why should you care ? Again , the movie ha no feeling on any level . Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movie produced by Disney that were done extremely well . Sadly , Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempt in the past such a the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame . Disney need to get back to their root . A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never know what the result will be until you see it for yourself . And now that Disney ha discovered Science Fiction one hope that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it . We also hope that the upcoming `` Treasure Planet '' , a sci-fi adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson 's `` Treasure Island '' , will have more heart to it than the unfathomable `` Atlantis : The Lost Empire '' .",0
"Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan , an average man who feel God is messing up his life . God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his way . Of course , giving someone God 's power could take a turn for the worse . Bruce Almighty is a good comedy , Jim Carrey is good , a always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home a God and the cast brings the plot together well . The joke are almost always on target , although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey 's facial expression . I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God , not only that but also a a black man . I thought this quite well , especially with the brilliant Freeman . There are some hilarious scene , the opening cookie scene for instance , others miss the target slightly but still a good film . 6/7 out of 10",1
"This film wa hard to get a hold of , and when I eventually saw it the disappointment wa overwhelming . I mean , this is one of the great story of the twentieth century : an unknown man take advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with million in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt . With all of this built-in interest , how could anyone make such a lackluster , talk-laden flick of this true-life event . While Williams is always interesting , the screenwriter assumed that the D.B . Cooper persona wa stereotypically heroic like a movie star , s what we get is a type-without any engaging detail or insight into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off . Harrold practically steal the movie with her spunk and pure beauty , but the real letdown wa in the handling of the plot and the lame direction . Shame on this film for even existing .",0
"I just watched this film this morning and I found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith . Babette gave them another way to look at life ; not a replacement , but an enhancement . She shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her . I see the story of God in here . He sent his only son to man . Man could not possibly give anything that would equal that . So , for our small sacrifice , we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it . In this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of God . Babette showed them that life and God can indeed be beautiful in it 's fullest sense . The love that God 's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our life will be the richer for it . Even the film is a metaphor . It seems slow in the beginning , but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end . It wa truly a feast .",1
"with this film being directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino doing the screenplay i wa sure this wa going to be a gem . i wa wrong . i do n't hate this film but in no way do i like it . i love Roger Avery because of his amazing direction in rule of attraction and his screenplay to pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake making this . do i really need to comment on Tarantino , we all know he a genius . this movie is just set around a gang robbing a bank but fails due to silly people participating in the robbery i 'm disappointed in Tarantino and Avery for doing this film but doe n't change my mind on how amazing they both are . everyone make mistake ......... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton",0
"Funny . Sad . Charming . These are all word that floated through my head while I wa watching this beautiful , simple film . It is rare that a movie truly move me , but `` Shall We Dance ? '' accomplished that with grace to spare . Gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experience of my movie-viewing history . It left me with a quiet sense of exultation , but with a small touch of sadness mixed in . And the dancing , oh yes , the dancing . Even if you are not a lover of the art , or ca n't put one foot in front of another , the step displayed here will take your breath away , and make you want to sign up for class a fast a you can . It wa absolutely enchanting , even the part that show Sugiyama 's ( touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho ) stilted step when he wa first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous , child-like way . And yet , this film wa not entirely about dancing , but more about the subtlety of human behavior and feeling . We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feeling through dance , a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art , and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast . Beauty . Pain . Emotion . All the love and little agony of life are here , expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture .",1
"Justin go home to live with his strict , hard-nosed police detective father , but it seems daddy ha turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartment each with bizarre tenant residing in them . Straight-laced idealist Justin is thrust into the world of the occult , murder , under-aged drinking and other dastardly thing . Ho-hum Wow , have I seen the same film that nearly all the other reviewer on here saw ? ? ? Clever , compelling , original , intense , clever , genius ? ? ? ? ! ! ? I witnessed none of those thing . What I DID see wa an uninteresting , bland , trite , extremely clichéd low-budget thriller that wa ripe with implausibility and no tension in the least bit a the killer is telegraphed a soon into the film a he give his monologue/debate/discussion . And where are these humorous laugh-out-loud moment ? I never so much a chuckled , perhaps because i wa too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film .

"The above line sum it up pretty good . The best asset of the comic are it 's visual gag and word-jokes ( the latter of which are almost impossible to translate , which is why the comic are at their best in their original language ) . Both are quite hard to capture in film , which is why those will never be a good a the comic . Movies are simply a different medium than comic . With that in mind , this movie doe surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic . The word gag are bearable , and sometimes even funny ( Debouze doe an Amelie reference ! ) . I have to mention that I watched the french version . If you do n't watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limit you to the subtitle , the word joke will probably suck . The slapstick is okay a well ; it 's a very simple form of humor , and not really funny when you 're older than twelve , but it capture the spirit of the comicbooks . The other visual joke are the movie 's saving grace for the older audience , a their often quite funny . The acting is totally over the top , but again , that 's not annoying at all a it capture the spirit of the comicbooks . Only Depardieu and Clavier do n't really overact , which might be the reason some people think they did n't enjoy their role ( I did n't notice a thing ) . On the other hand Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich turn overacting into an artform . It 's actually fun to watch . Again , I fear it would n't be nearly a funny when the voice are dubbed . Overall not a bad movie at all , much better than the previous one . It 's not a classic and it doe n't dethrone The Twelve Tasks of Asterix a my favourite Asterix movie , but it 's still worth seeing . The french version , that is . 7/10",1
"I would label this show a horrendous if it were n't for the fact that it 's on the same network a Arrested Development . Because it is on FOX and getting renewed while AD got cancelled . It is absolutely beyond word how atrocious this show actually is . But let me try and describe it . Take an extremely low rate Archie Bunker and have him spout out humor that would have been out of date if it were on Married with Children . Then take great plot line from AD ( son ha an ugly , boring girlfriend ) and dumb them down so the idiot who watch sitcom can understand them . If you watch this , I will have completely lost respect for you , a should your family . However , if you are a fan , you should love FOX 's new comedy 'Til Death . Looks like real funny , cutting-edge stuff . I mean , married couple not getting along ... brilliant .",0
"Robert Mitchum star a Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western : Man With The Gun . Tollinger is a professional town tamer - a in , when a town need someone to save itself ; he is the one who is brought in to do it . Tollinger 's latest gig come by a an accident : strolling into town looking for his former fling , he stumble into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster . But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger , a his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing ( suddenly High Plains Drifter seems le original ) . Man With The Gun start off a an average western tough-guy film but begin to surprise you more and more a the film progress . What start off a forgettable and run-of-the-mill end up dark and character-centered . The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable . Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his very best performance , Mitchum still ha his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knock the action-packed , meaningful , and shocking scene of the film right out of the park . Man With The Gun is a nice Mitchum western and is easily worth one 's time .",1
"My favorite film this year . Great character and plot , and the direction and editing wa smooth , visually beautiful , and interesting . Set in Barcelona , the film follows a year in the life of six foreign graduate student and assorted others . Cultures and language clash but heart and life intertwine . The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood , but he carried the part perfectly . The character were nicely developed and their interplay wa honest and accurate . There were two especially noteworthy scene , the climax wa truly inspired . The film is sentimental , and the last ten minute could have been cut , but it wa wonderfully entertaining . I nearly did n't watch it , but did just to see Audrey Tautou . Her role although billed second or third wa minor , and wa outshined by several other character . I wish more film like this were made . It brought to mind The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club . Do n't start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1/2 way through .",1
"the film itself is absolutely brilliant , it that buzz , that rush that make you just want to go out , blow your wage and loose yourself . It 's what the weekend is all about , it our sanitation where we can come together a one and be ourselves without a care in the world . The film is layered in depth and the dialogue in place is just spot on , especially with Jip . The character themselves are instantly likable , one in particular is obviously dyer character and his view on what `` Star Wars '' is really about , genius . If ever you 've got an hour to kill before going out , stick on this , you 'll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence , definitely recommend it .",1

this is more than a Sat . afternoon special . Exremely well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it . Catch the cat companion/scout for instance . It not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book . The comic industry ( a well a the film 's publicist ) missed the boat on this . One of the least know really great film . A great script by John Sayles is a strong point but the acting is good a well . Probably the best `` super hero '' film I 've ever seen . Short on special effect but long on believability . This one 's a keeper . I have never seen a DVD of this film but i used to own a VHS version . Good hunting,1
"I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life , I can not believe that I wasted $ 10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it ha issue . Who ever actually spent money to make this movie wa insane =D This movie ha TERRIBLE actor and some of the scene make absolutely no sense . Well , the whole movie doe n't make sense . Also the part where those `` men '' come into the diner ( department of national security ) that happened to be the worst part of the film . How dare they say Frank Sinatra 's name in vain ? Also , what is up with those glass ? When the guy and girl are in the car and she `` drink '' water , you can totally tell that she is n't even drinking ! Also , what is up with the freaky dinner guy . And everyone know that you do n't stab tire , you slash them .",0
"This is the best of Shelley Duvall 's high-quality `` Faerie Tale Theatre '' series . The ugly stepsister are broadway-quality comedy relief , and Eve Arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood . Jennifer Beals doe an excellent job a a straight Cinderella , especially in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick 's Prince Charming . Jean Stapleton play the fairy godmother well , although I 'm not sure I liked the `` southern lady '' characterization with some of the line . Steve Martin 's comedy relief a the Royal Orchestra Conductor is quintessential Martin , but a tiny bit misplaced in the show 's flow . As is customary with the series , there are several wry comment thrown in for the older child ( age 15 and up ) . With a couple of small bump , the show flow well , and they live happily ever after . Children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parent finally get tired of it -- I found 3 time in one day to be a little too much .",1

"Let me say from the outset I 'm not a particular fan of this kind of film , but Nightbreed hold a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective . Back in the old day , the folk who inhabit Midian would have been called Zombies , the undead . And according to what Clive Barker ha given u certain member of human kind , in this Craig Sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world . Psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional ha taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Nightbreed . He trick the police into killing Sheffer , but Sheffer go to a graveyard named Midian cemetery where the Nightbreed congregate and live underground . Sheffer ha also left a girl friend , Anne Bobby , who still ha feeling for him even after he 's been killed and is now one of the undead . She try in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind . Clive Barker 's creature are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of human . But it 's plain to see that if human left them alone , the Nightbreed in turn not bother with them . Your sympathy are definitely with the Nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and redneck police chief Charles Haid in action . Clive Barker 's been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people . I can see where that would come in , especially since there are a whole lot of people who do n't even think of gay a anything human because they 're taught that way . Granted Nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence , but it also doe make you think and I do like the way Clive Barker doe turn traditional theology on it head and make Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for the Nightbreed creature .",1
"I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what I 've gathered , it will be interesting ( when I finally do read it and I will ) . My comment will be based purely on the film . As soon a I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and wa so excited but when I finally did , I wa so disappointed it hurt . This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish . The actor were not well cast ( though Robards and Pryce are both good actor - just not here ) . The kid actor , it seemed , were merely asked to show up , get in the character ' clothes , say the line and make the face . The set and prop were cheap and unrealistic . The direction wa surprisingly bad . I wa so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it , just to see the kind of work he had done . The editing wa cut and paste and the plot ( screenplay ) wa just that a well ( even though the author had been involved himself , irony ? ) . The building up of the tension , fear and suspense wa so mild it wa ineffective when the climax finally came . I 've read some of the comment on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it . What hurt the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing . It had so much potential . Unfortunately , the film wa so technically bad it take away from the brilliance of the story .",0
"This is a truly awful `` B '' movie . It is witless and often embarrassing . The plot , the basic `` making into show business '' routine , is almost nonexistent . In fact , the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music group of 1942 , including the Mills Brothers , Count Basie , Duke Ellington , Bob Crosby , and Freddy Slack . Each group get about the standard three minute , the exception being the Mills Brothers , who for some reason warranted two number . Ann Miller doe n't get to dance until the last couple of minute of the film , and she ha little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda . The most interesting moment in the film , in my view , occurred in the Duke Ellington segment . The band appears to be playing in a train , standing in awkward position . ( In the deep South at the time , the band wa segregated in railroad car when traveling . ) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke , and Harry Carney may also be identified . In the last moment of the film , trumpeter/violinist Ray Nance rush down the aisle to the camera and doe an `` uncle Tom , '' bugging his eye and wiggling his head the way Willy Best did in many film . For modern viewer , especially jazz fan , this homage to segregation is sad indeed . Some movie go best unseen .",0
"I have to admit I am prejudiced about my vote on this film , but I have strong reason a I know some of the true history that wa given the Hollywood treatment here . Edna Ferber 's novel upon which this is based is from an era where real name ca n't be used . In a way , this film is all smoke & mirror . Even though it wa released in 1946 , it wa filmed shortly after Casablanca . Ingrid Bergman is at her most radiant in this movie a a brunette . She play a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband . Today that is a gold digger , but in this social era , she is desirable & the kind of woman who make all the men want her , & all the old snooty society type talk of her & avoid her , while wishing they were her . Ingrid is at her best & play this role well . Some sympathy for Ingrids character is raised in the New Orleans section of this film a she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother a part of the settlement by her relative to get her to leave New Orleans . The snooty family of relative there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town . Gary Cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing Texan Bachelor/Gambler . He pull it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he wa due to his real life chain smoking . Flora Robison a Ingrid 's Maid got nominated for an Oscar a supporting actress in this film . Jerry Austin a Cupidor wa over-looked in many way for his role but is the only comic relief in the film & doe it well . When the film move to Saratoga , it depicts accurately how important Saratoga wa in that era . I like the sequence when Bergman walk to the Saratoge Spring to get some of the `` sulfur '' water which everyone considered so healthy then . When she drink some she force herself not to make a face and comment how good it is & that she must have more . The real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in Tunnel , New York- which is the actual Saratoga Trunk the film title is derived from . This battle actually happened in 1869 between agent for Andrew Carnagie & J. P. Morgan . The line wa the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country & the east coast . The reference to it are throughout the film are very real . There is even some dialog describing Carnagie a a `` Scot '' though the reference is vague & unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle . The railroad line & the railroad tunnel in Tunnel , New York ( zip code 13848 ) still exist although the film wa shot in California . The real tunnel is about 1 mile long . It is still part of a key freight line today , year after this occurred . I grew up there . Gary Cooper 's line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right , it is still `` mighty pretty country '' .",1
This movie is n't even good enough for the $ 1 bin at the grocery store . I only purchased it because Terrence Howard wa in it . Guess he could n't be too choosy about his role during this time . The movie in itself wa hard to sit through . It seemed they were grasping at straw with a storyline . The `` guy night out '' had to be the most boring I 've ever seen . One minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry ? Even the argument were hard to follow . Most of the acting lacked any depth . I have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark .,0
"This is a spectacular production ! I have seen the show live twice in Chicago and my only problem with the production wa the fact that I wa able to perceive only fragment of what wa going on . The stage consisted of three giant catwalk and the platform and a the action move from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located . As always , this is a thought-provoking sensory overload , skillfully captured in high definition with 15 camera ! The footage wa Masterfully edited , one of the best concert DVDs of all time in my opinion ! I only hope and wish that they will release this on Blu-Ray of HD-DVD so that we can re-live this extravaganza over and over again .",1
"I 'm not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s , it would take two day to outline how the whole thing is n't even remotely possible . Others have pointed out all the relevant stupidity already . Given all that , I still could have sort of enjoyed it , if only they had n't included all the maudlin , nauseating , infuriating , Disneyesque sentimental crap , which is so out of place anywhere , but nowhere more than out in space , where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death . The `` crew '' , a well a the `` real '' astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else . It completely ruined any value the production may have had left . I 'm surprised NASA let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them . If you have n't seen this yet , save yourself the irritation . Watch Apollo 13 again . At least that tried to be sort of real .",0
"This film wa adapted from the well known sutra on Journey to the West where a monk with his three student seek out to find a long lost book with regard to the teaching of Buddha . Though this movie is not a solemn a the previous film made according to the legend , it did however , managed to bring in romance and fun-filled humorous scene . This real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creature . One of his student , the Monkey God managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time , but were in turn captured by the demon and cast into the deep throat of a dragon , locked up in that particular dungeon . The monk awoke in a small village where he found Mei Yan ( the so called ugly serpent daughter ) who fell in love over him at first sight . Though ugly , she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him . However , a quest for rescuing his three student soon turn out to be filled with obstacle and each of which turned out to get worse with Mei Yan following the monk . Problems crept deeper and this is where conflict between the relationship get worse . The rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal , but suffice to say , this film doe not depict the typical storyline of the book , it is more for those who want to seek out for a funny and light picture of what Journey to the West and the love obstacle really mean . Towards the very end , the whole summary could be described with only one word , and that is love . The monk went to show the Heavenly Gates , the Celestial Palace and Buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit a the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior power . A wonderfully created and funny act awaits those who buy this ticket . There would be of course , no regret , at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film .",1
"Let me first state that I enjoy watching `` bad '' movie . It 's funny how some of these film leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb one . This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way . This vehicle for Sam Mraovich 's delusional ego doe n't just border on talentless ineptitude , it ha redefined the very meaning of the word . This should forever be the barometer for bad movie . Sort of the Mendoza line for film . Mr. Mraovich writes , directs , and star a blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wife and the Christian force of evil a he and his partner Ben `` dead behind the eye '' Sheets struggle for marital equality . As a libertarian I believe gay should have a right to get married . Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobe . The portrayal of all thing Christian are so ugly and ham-fisted , trademark Mraovich , that you ca n't possibly take any of them seriously . Arthur 's brother Victor , the bible toting Jesus freak , is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he wa cast in this role . That 's because Sam `` multitasking '' Mraovich wa also casting director . The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself . When you think leading man do the word pasty , balding , and chubby come to mind ? Sam also delivers line like domino 's pizza , cold and usually wrong . The final tally : you suck at writing , directing , acting and casting . That 's the Ed Wood quadruple crown . Congratulations you horrible little man .",0
"Essentially a undistinguished B-movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era 's major talent , Fritz Lang . Even with the stellar name of Lang , Walter Pidgeon , Joan Bennett and George Sanders , be prepared for a ludicrous storyline , bad acting , patently phony set and miscasting . For transparency sake , I have to admit I am an ardent non-admirer of Walter Pidgeon , who wa lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dream-factory of MGM , and somehow worked in secondary role , supporting Greer Garson and others . He is wildly miscast , acting in a chipper , '30s-Ray Milland madcap comedy tone , in a role where his life is in danger , and he is in hiding . Joan Bennett 's cockney accent is excessive , but her lacquered hair , perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a street-wise Cockney slum-girl . George Sanders is incapable of bad acting , but disappears after the preposterous opening find Pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler . Surprising for Fritz Lang is the unevenness of tone . I found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moment of suspense-thriller surrounded by light-hearted comedic interplay . Hitchcock totally reversed the ratio , using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense . There is a reason this film is unknown . It did n't serve or propel anybody 's career or reputation , and is forgotten because it 's a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group .",0
"When , oh when , will Hollyweird write a decent movie based around computer ? I can not believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story . No computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface . It may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nut . As for `` tracing '' people the way she did it simply can not be done that way . Network security alone would prevent that from happening . The key stroke logging wa laughable to say the least . Regarding the software that wa supposedly being installed , no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it ha been tested , retested and tested again on a sandbagged system . But probably the worst possible part of the movie wa the `` virus '' . There is no way that a virus that work on one operating system will work on any other system . And a for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of second , that just beggar belief . There is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow deletion of system file . I could go on but I ca n't be bothered . A porno ha a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage .",0
"This movie wa so incredibly boring , Michael J . Fox could 've done so much better . Sorry , but it 's true for all you people who liked the movie",0
"This movie is so unreal . French movie like these are just waste of time . Why watch this movie ? Even , I did not know .. why . What ? The well known sex scene of half-siblings ? Although the sex scene is so real and explicit , but the story it is based upon is so unreal . What is the use of it , then ? Can you find easily in life , half sibling doing such thing ? Did I learn something from this movie ? Yeah : some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movie , such story , such non-sense . But for those who like nihilism , nothingness in life , or simply a life without hope , then there you are .. you 've got to see this movie . Only one worth adoring , though : CATHERINE DENEUVE . She 's such a strikingly beautiful woman .",0
"The Nest is really just another 'nature run amock ' horror flick that fails because of the low budget . The acting is OK , and the setting is great , but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me . The gore effect are not the best I 've seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way . The roach themselves are just regular cockroach that bite people . The Nest reminded me of a much better film called Slugs . If you liked The Nest then Slugs is a must-see a it 's ten time better . Also worth noting is that Lisa Langlois who play Elizabeth wa in another 'nature run amock ' type film called Deadly Eyes ( aka The Rats ) , which is about killer rat a you may have guessed . If you enjoy these type of horror film then you may want to give this a watch , but you 'd be far better off seeing Slugs which is far more interesting and gory .",0
"Excellent endearing film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining force a father and dad . Dad show up one evening to state that after over 40 year of marriage , mom ( Olympia Dukakis ) ha left him . The rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get dad 's thought off what ha occurred . With them away , the daughter can play detective . The story show the adventure of father and son in their discussion of life , what should have been , why mom wa complaining about dad a they discus their philosophy of life . We see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which lead to a near brawl . Both men seem to break out of their daily life . The end is a downer a we learn why mom suddenly left . It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity . It 's never too late to change .",1
"Beware , My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifty and wa directed by a man , Harry Horner , better known for his set design . Robert Ryan play a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her . The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doe n't know it . Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and try to win Ryan over , to little avail . He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure . Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well , but one of them ca n't do well because there is something wrong with him . He suffers periodic blackout during which he commits act of violence , which he later forgets . Essentially the effect Ryan ha on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey , or in another sense a sadist . The audience find out early on that Ryan is a mad killer , but it take Lupino much longer . Thus we must live with this knowledge a we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win ' Ryan over in order to make thing work , get the job done , get on with life . But getting on with thing is n't in Ryan 's makeup , a he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary form of normality , and a soon a there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself . As a study in mental illness the movie is n't too impressive . What it 's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness , with dangerous psychopathology in the mix , and it effect on a normal person . In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate , though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino ca n't 'fix ' Ryan , yet we want her to . The result is that , if one is willing , one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside , so to speak , it melodramatic structure . Horner show u , gradually , the layout the Lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feel like a home . We become familiar with staircase , kitchen and pantry ; and we come to know which window Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which one she ca n't .",1
"Marie Dressler carry this Depression-era drama about a kindly bank owner , which recently aired on TCM during their April Fools comedy month . If you come with the expectation of big laugh courtesy the Dressler-Polly Moran team , you 'll be disappointed , a this is really a very downbeat film . It 's also very poorly made , surprisingly so considering it came from MGM . Leonard Smith 's bare bone cinematography is strictly from the 'set up the camera and do n't move it ' school , frequently to the detriment of the cast , who find themselves delivering line off screen ( it 's like a pan and scan print before such existed ! ) or having their head cut off . The film doe n't even have a credited director , underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production . Overall , it 's an unsatisfying mess , with Dressler frequently over-emoting and only that bizarre , final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart .",0
"Cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value , even on the so bad it entertaining front . A friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing St. Vincent DePaul clothes bin . Okay , that may be a little bit dodgy but it wa meant to be a clothes bin , not a crappy old VHS bin , something the le fortunate member of our society do n't really need to make their life better . It could be considered a mercy . Watching a movie like Cyclone would really only add to their problem . Anyway the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rocket and laser is n't even properly exploited . The two 'high speed ' chase sequence involve vehicle travelling at le than hair raising speed of around 40 KMPH and a super-fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it . There is only one scene where the bike goofy weaponry is used , at the film 's climax , and it is laughably ineffectual , or just laughable , when it is . This includes laser beam that look like they should be coming out of the hand of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighty sword and sorcery that produced large burst of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their target even when they hit directly . The rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler . Lots of bad actor , yes even Combs and Landau suck in this , most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pu forward the barely coherent plot . There are a few badly staged fight sequence and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scene with some cop and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop . Comedy of the sub Benny Hill horny old man ca n't stop staring at the female lead chest variety . Basically the 'money ' scene involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material . Skip it .",0
"`` Cinderella '' is one of the most beloved of all Disney classic . And it really deserves it status . Based on the classic fairy-tale a told by Charles Perrault , the film follows the trial and tribulation of Cinderella , a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsister . When a royal ball is held and all eligible young woman are invited ( read : the King want to get the Prince to marry ) , Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother take her awful daughter with her . But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand ... The story of `` Cinderella '' on it own would n't be able to pad out a feature , so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise , the fairly incidental character of the animal whom the Fairy Godmother us to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella 's true sidekick . The mouse Jaq and Gus are the main sidekick , and their own nemesis being the stepmother 's cat Lucifer . Their antic intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot , and are for the most part wonderful . Admittedly , the film doe slow down a bit between the main introduction of the character and shortly before the stepsister depart for the ball , but after this slowdown , the film really get going again and surprisingly ( since `` Cinderella '' is the most worn down story of all time , probably ) end up a one of the most involving Disney story . The animation and art direction is lovely . All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture , and Mary Blair 's colour styling and concept art ( she also did concept art and colour styling for `` Alice in Wonderland '' , `` Peter Pan '' , `` The Three Caballeros '' and many many others ) manage to wiggle their way on screen . The colour and design are lovely , especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scene , a well a in those pretty little moment here and there . Overall , `` Cinderella '' rank a one of the best Disney fairy-tales and come recommended to young and all that embodies the Disney philosophy that dream really can come true .",1
"* * Might contain spoiler * * Ok , let conclude this movie in one word : bad . Two word ? Really bad . Now why do I think that ? Let me explain . Guttenberg lead a special-ops team consisting of four person that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab . They do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow get back the virus after some fighting . However , suspicion arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name . After debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown person and everyone start to suspect everyone else is involved . After deciding they cant trust their boss , they decide to , once again , steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attacker . In theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low-budget movie that just aim to be aired on TV . However , the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several account . Firstly , the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minute . Second . The acting is really bad , or the actor are directed to act a dummy . There are n't many emotion , change of facial expression at all etc . I wa especially disappointed in Guttenberg that I believe can do so much more , but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action-hero . In addition , though I am not by any mean any expert on the subject , I totally believe I could assemble a better covert-ops team by picking up five stranger and train them for a week . This seems to be a theme in the movie to do thing a stupid and unprofessionally a possible . This go for good guy , bad guy and bystander a well . Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultant , if any , of the film . For example , I have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and I did n't break instantly . Do n't know how to conclude this really , but let say that this movie ha a predictable plot , bad acting and they seem to be amateur in whatever the do . Sorry , ca n't be any nicer than that . Do not watch this movie , it is not even so bad it is funny . 2/10",0
"The premise of an African-American female Scrooge in the modern , struggling city wa inspired , but nothing else in this film is . Here , Ms. Scrooge is a miserly banker who take advantage of the employee and customer in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits . There is no doubt about the good intention of the people involved . Part of the problem is that story 's root do n't translate well into the urban setting of this film , and the script fails to make the update work . Also , the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly , the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reach it familiar end . This is a message film that doe n't know when to quit . In the title role , the talented Cicely Tyson give an overly uptight performance , and at time line are difficult to understand . The Charles Dickens novel ha been adapted so many time , it 's a struggle to adapt it in a way that make it fresh and relevant , in spite of it very relevant message .",0
"It wa evident until the final credit that this film wa made in 1989 , a all the element of it production were made to look 1960 's - the acting , the characterisation , the set and the prop all had an aesthetic from an earlier time . The film open to the moment prior to the dropping of the A-bomb on Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affect one family : a young woman , Yasuko , who life with her aunt and uncle . Even in black and white , and using special effect that are quite primitive by modern standard but emotive and effective nonetheless , the depiction of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific . Family member become unrecognisable to each other , others resemble zombie a they wander the street bedraggled and in shock . The title refers to rainfall that fell soon after the bomb , which wa mixed with radioactive ash , and in which Yasuko is caught . Rumors of Yasuko 's being in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect her marriage prospect and it is later learnt that the black rain is indeed causing sickness . The film is concerned not just with the physical effect of the bomb on the Japanese , but on the social and psychological damage that wa wrought . I found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture . While the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family , the film 's gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time - war have horrific consequence , and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary . It is said that history repeat itself , and the current leader of the 'Coalition of the Willing ' have learned nothing . While atomic warfare ha not resurfaced since 1945 , other deadly after-effects have . This film is compelling viewing .",1
"I have very few to add to what all the other reviewer already made more than clear ! This movie is awful ! Beyond awful ... In fact , so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is `` Skeleton Man '' . In case you expect your movie to feature a minimum of logic and plot , you should stay a far away from this a humanly possible . Sure , load of people are getting killed by this skeleton-puppet wearing a ridiculous cape , but nobody ever bother to properly explain what he is , where he come from or why he 's so angry with the world . He look like a crossover between Skeletor from `` Masters of the Universe '' and the horseman from `` Sleepy Hollow '' and run amok in some godforsaken wilderness . The setting of `` Skeleton Man '' is another totally retarded aspect ! For nearly half an hour , I assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island , but it simply play at the mainland where fancy highway cross the forest and power plant are located at the end of the wood ! Huh ? Why doe everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape route ? Anyway , after a couple of totally random killing , a special commando squad , led by poor washed-up Michael Rooker , arrives to come and hunt a monster they do n't know anything about . Really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces him/herself a the expert in a certain field ( we have a sniper-specialist , a tracking genius , a drill instructor ... ) , yet they ALL die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skill ! The horror Gods must really hate Casper Van Dien , a he 's present again a well , portraying an heroic soldier who steal a truck for no apparent reason , crash on the highway , but somehow get catapulted back to the middle of the wood to die there . Right , that make sense ... Furthermore the character steal cool one-liner from `` Predator '' , the bonehead 's horse constantly change color , helicopter are brought down with bow & arrow , ordinary bullet cause tree to explode and completely pointless Vietnam flashback haunt Michael Rooker . I say we all combine force and vote this pathetic flick into the IMDb bottom top 100 ASAP !",0
"This is a very funny movie , easy to watch , that entertains you almost all the time . The work of the Director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark . The movie is a typical police partner history like lethal weapon , but the joke and comedy are of Argentinian sort . The twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and ha to go with detective Diaz ( played by Luque ) on his assignment while he also assist him ( Diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him ) . Some of the dialog are hilarious worldwide : understandable and laughable anywhere . Is very good overall , it would deserved an 8 , but I rated 7 because it get a little down at the end . On a personal remark I must add that is a `` bravo '' for Argentinian Filmmakers , considering the little good is coming lately .",1
"I 'll give writer/director William Gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived `` thriller . '' A good argument for not wasting money subscribing to HBO , let alone buying DVDs based on cover art and blurb . A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco add nothing significant to their resume , although the art direction is not half bad . The dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at it conceit ; this is storytelling at it worst . No tension , no suspense , no dread , no fear , no empathy , no catharsis , no nothing . A few attractive and often nude female spice up the boredom , but this is definitely a film best seen a a trailer . I feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing . Good for late-night , zoned-out viewing only . You have been warned .",0
"I 'll give this movie two star because it teems with beautiful photography . Otherwise , it teems mainly with clichés and stereotype : mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind , or wise white Indians . Indians are magical people who move around without a sound , can disappear in the blink of an eye , talk to animal , and read mind over large distance . And so on and so forth . Throughout the movie I kept wondering what the point of the film wa ( other than showing me pretty picture of mountain , log cabin , wood , an assortment of animal , free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church ) . The plot touched a whole range of issue but explored none of them in depth . This wa neither a story about growing up during the depression , nor about about being an orphan , nor about a struggle for identity . It tried to be all of those thing and more , which made it superficial and unsatisfactory . Although the movie wa supposed to be about Little Tree 's education , we learn almost nothing about it . He wa given a brief summary of the history of his people ( who were brave and stoic ) and a distillery demonstration ; tried his hand at chopping wood ( at which he failed ) and whiskey running ( literally ) ; learned how to read ( and maybe to write ) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that wa it . Apparently he did n't learn much during his stint in boarding school because he wa locked up in the attic . However , grandma and grandpa and Graham Greene 's character made sure that in the end Little Tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal a an adult - after , and I 'm paraphrasing here , `` riding with the Navajos '' and `` getting caught up in a couple of war '' - wa to `` catch up '' with grandma and grandpa and Graham Greene 's character in heaven ( instead of , say , dating girl , getting married , having child or other such nonsense ) . Last but not least I must say that I found grandpa 's trade offensive . Why of all thing did it have to be a whiskey still ? To counteract the stereotype of the `` drunken Indian '' ?",0
"`` Laugh , Clown Laugh '' released in 1928 , star the legendary Lon Chaney a a circus clown named Tito . Tito ha raised a foundling ( a young and beautiful Loretta Young ) to adulthood and name her Simonetta . Tito ha raised the girl in the circus life , and she ha become an accomplished ballerina . While Chaney give his usual great performance , I could not get past the fact that Tito , now well into middle age , ha the hots for the young Simonetta . Although he is not her biological father , he ha raised her like a daughter . That kind of `` ick '' factor permeates throughout the film . Tito competes for Simonetta 's affection with a young and handsome 'Count ' Luigi ( Nils Asther ) . Simonetta clearly fall for the young man , but feel guilt about abandoning Tito ( out of loyalty , not romantic love ) . The whole premise of the film is ridiculous , and I find it amazing that no one in the film tell Tito what a stupid old fool he is being ( until he reveals it himself at the end ) . The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young , who would go on to have a great career . While I adore Chaney 's brilliance a an actor , this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy .",0
"I 'm sorry guy , all who thought this film could be something great , I 'm afraid you would be disappointed . The standard , the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot . So simple , that the movie is not evolving until the end . I asked myself if the plot wa n't about the action but about the main character ( played by Mickey Rourke ) , but I found that the character wa inconsistent - either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother . But both do n't go together , because the kid he try to guide pose him in dangerous situation where no professional killer would put himself . Now , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , is a good looking actor , but he played his character a little unnatural . I did n't believe his acting , it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he could n't provide . And he did n't have to , because his le crazy behavior wa creepy enough . The only one whose acting wa great , wa Diane Lane . If not her , i would give this movie 1 star . In conclusion , I expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot . And I completely blew it with my high expectation .",0
"Musically speaking Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another pluperfect musical after Top Hat if that wa possible . Although in this case like that Jerome Kern confection Roberta that they were in , Follow the Fleet retained Randolph Scott with another singer , this time Harriet Hilliard . Randolph Scott is a career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers his former partner . But now the two are on shore leave . Fred and Ginger take up right where they left off , and Randy accidentally meet Ginger 's dowdy sister Harriet who blossom into a real beauty . But Randy 's a typical love 'em and leave 'em sailor . Again Irving Berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production . Ginger get to do some really outstanding vocalizing with Let Yourself Go which she and Fred later dance to . But the real hit of the show is Let 's Face the Music and Dance which is a number done at a Navy show . Sung first by Astaire and later danced to by the pair , Let 's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic number ever written for the screen . Their dancing on this one is absolute magic . I 'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard a few younger people might ask who that wa . But they will know immediately when I mention her in conjunction with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson . That 's right Ozzie and Harriet . It 's something of a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Ricky 's mom on television . Then again she did n't even keep her own name . Neither Ozzie or Harriet sang on television . Ozzie wa a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee a a singer , but Harriet could really carry a tune . She sings Get Thee Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I Are Here , But Where Are You , both with real feeling and class . I recommend you see Follow the Fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of Harriet Hilliard incredibly forgotten today .",1
"I can never fathom why people take time to review movie that they have not understood fully . I know people will read scathing review on these page of this film , and it will keep them from seeking copy of this quite forgotten , late '20s style but 1932 movie , which should probably be referred to a `` Indecent , '' a that is the name on the main title . Myrna Loy , best known a a comic actress in countless genteel role , show herself to be miscast in all of them . She wa a true dramatic actress , something that I did not know before watching this film , which predates all of her famous role . She is exciting and moving here , two thing she never wa opposite the graceful and refined William Powell . I 'm still rather in shock over how good she wa . Becky Sharp ( 1935 ) , the first three-strip Technicolor feature , is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation . It is also very poignant a an expression of a film style that wa about to die . You can not take my word for it , you must see it .",1
"I 'm always surprised about how many time you 'll see something about World War 2 on the German national television . You would think they do n't like to open old wound , but there is n't a week that go by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocity of this war . Perhaps it 's a way of dealing with their past , I do n't know , but you sure ca n't blame them of ignoring what happened . And it ha to be said : most of those documentary are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movie ( think for instance about `` Der Untergang '' or `` The Downfall '' a you might now it ) which are also very realistic . One of those movie is `` Rosenstrasse '' . It tell a true story and deal with the subject of the mixed marriage during the war , even though the movie start with a family in the USA , at the present day . After Hannah 's father died , her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she ha n't been very religious before . She doe n't know where the strange behavior of her mother come from , but a she start digging in her mother 's troubled childhood , Hannah understands how little she ha ever known about her mother 's past . The fact that this movie deal with the subject of the mixed marriage during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising . For a far a I know , there ha n't been another movie that deal with this subject . ( For those who did n't know this yet : Being married to a so-called pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they were n't immediately sent to one of the concentration camp , but that they had to work in a factory ) . But it doe not only tell something about the problem of the mixed marriage , it also give a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parent and relative . How difficult it sometimes wa for them during the Nazi regime and how these people , most of the time woman , did everything within their power to free their men , once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrasse ... The acting is really good and the story is very well written , although the way it wa presented in the beginning did n't really do it for me ( and that 's exactly the only part that you 'll get to see in the trailer ) . Perhaps it 's just me , but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day . At least of the part that is situated in the USA , because the part where Hannah go to Berlin and talk to someone who know more about her mother 's past , definitely work . If you are interested in everything that ha something to do with the Second World War , and if you are n't necessarily looking for a lot of action shot , than this is definitely a movie you should see . This is n't a movie in which you 'll see any battle or gunfight , but it certainly is an interesting movie , because it give you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of . I give it an 8/10 .",1
"Christian Propaganda ... Lots of fear mongering ... This is not SciFi , this is ChriFi ( Christian fiction ) .The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn . From then on it wa all about god , jc , the holy bible and the devil . The ufo 's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe . Satan 's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible . The abduction could be used to explain away the rapture . The people left behind would believe it wa a mass alien abduction , instead of god taking all the Christians to heaven . No reason to repent if it alien . The deeper message in the movie is that if you do n't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life ha no purpose .",0
"This DVD is missing it calling a a Heineken coaster .... This is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a different director/writer than the original . Two hour of this turkey left me begging for Exorcist 2 rerun . NO legitimate laugh . NOT ONE decent scare . The script wa just a mess and I felt bad for the actor who had to perform it ( they must have had sick relative at home or monster coke habit or something ) . The original wa a makeup effect landmark . So naturally , the producer of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup FX and do CG werewolf instead . These CG werewolf had me laughing a lot harder than any of the `` comedy '' . It wa just a total miss . If ya want a night 's entertainment , go rent the original again . Or go take a film class and make your own horror film . You 're bound to do better than these fool did .",0
"This incredibly formulaic flick from the `` Walker , Texas Ranger '' squad contains some of the most unbelievable scene ever witnessed within a TV movie . In addition , one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go . However , it 's a fun little movie that get the job done : it entertains . That 's all it wa meant to do and it doe so . The stunt and explosion are fun and exciting and the plot is n't half bad . The acting is also decent , which is n't much of a surprise , because everyone know that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal . If you 're a fan of the genre ( and of `` Walker , Texas Ranger '' ) , you will definitely love this . If not , then do n't waste your time . 8/10",1
"Karen ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work , is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman , Emma ( Grace Zabriskie ) , after her previous caretaker , Yoko ( Yoko Maki ) , disappears . Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma 's home , and she attempt to `` see how deep the rabbit hole go '' . Maybe it 's a delayed influence from the success of M. Night Shyamalan 's film , but slower-paced , understated horror film are a recent trend . In some case , such a Hide and Seek ( 2005 ) , the approach work remarkably well , and in others , such a White Noise ( 2005 ) , the pacing tends to kill the film . I did n't like The Grudge quite a much a Hide and Seek , but this is still a very good film -- it earns a 9 out of 10 from me . The Grudge ha a couple significant difference from other recent example of that trend , however . One , it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with Ju-On ( 2000 ) ( in particular , it 's extremely close to the first half of Ju-On : The Grudge , aka Ju-On 3 , from 2003 ) . Two , a with many Japanese horror film , the slower pacing here is n't so much in the realm of realist drama a with surrealism . As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror , The Grudge should be looked at more a a filmed nightmare . Director Takashi Shimizu , also the director of the five Japanese entry in the Ju-On series to date ( the fifth is currently in production ) , and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot hole when it come to the horror behind the story . The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scene , with dream logic , where the focus is atmosphere , creepiness , the uncanny , and for many viewer -- scare . How well the film work for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to , or are used to , this different approach to film-making ( although admittedly , some of the seeming gap are filled in by previous entry in the Ju-On series ) . Traditionally , American audience consider a flaw leaving plot thread hanging and abandoning `` rule '' for the `` monster '' . A more poetic , metaphorical , surreal approach to film is n't yet accepted by the mainstream in the U.S . However , even if you 're not used to it , it 's worth trying to suspend your normal preconception about film and give The Grudge a shot . This is a well written , well directed , well acted film , filled with unusual property , such a the story interweaving a large number of `` main character '' ( which is done better here than the more episodic Ju-On 3 ) , good cinematography , subtle production design touch ( check out Gellar 's clothes , which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emma 's house , when Gellar first approach ) , and beautifully effective horror material . Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past , the pacing usually enhances the eeriness , and there is no shortage of bizarre event to keep horror fan entertained . The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing , and based on interview on the DVD with Shimizu , have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese belief and folklore . Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture , it 's interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror film feature scary child and adult who look like scary child . I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a `` here 's what really happened '' flashback , but even that wa fairly well done , and otherwise , this would have been a 10 out of 10 . Now that I 've said all of the above , let me finish with a mini-rant : It 's not that I 'm anti-remake , but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributor and studio feel that we need remake of foreign film to make them appropriate for consumption . The original version of these film should just be playing in U.S. theater in wide release . There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actor for non-white or foreign actor . Yes , The Grudge is a fine film , but ultimately , I 'd rather see something original using this talent , and be treated to the latest foreign horror film -- not just Japanese , but also Indian , Spanish , Chinese , etc. -- at my multiplex . In the hope that someone with some pull at the studio read this , it is also more cost-effective to do this , a ( 1 ) you can completely avoid production cost , and simply make domestic distribution deal from which you receive profit , and ( 2 ) you can make money off of fan like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg version .",1
"This movie is pure guano . Mom always said if you ca n't say anything nice ... but even Mom would say I had to do my part to warn others of this movie . I can guarantee this is the film that Geoffrey Rush wish would just go away . I would hope that Greg Kinnear fired his agent .. from a cannon for giving him the script . After this Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch `` There 's Still Something About Mary . '' I have always been a fan of Wes Studi 's , thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people wo n't identify the film with him . It start of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the Batman film and then just loses something ... like a coherent plot and half decent effect . The joke are telegraphed an hour before the punchline come , and even then they fall flat . If you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see `` Chasing Amy '' . RUN ! DO N'T WALK AWAY FROM `` MYSTERY MEN '' !",0
"A group of young filmmaker with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on `` Dante 's Inferno , '' there is nothing especially clever . Dante 's `` Divine Comedy '' wa a brilliant piece of social commentary . This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretension to High Art . I suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric poke at some icon of the political and/or religious right , and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icon poked . Be that a it may , few of those poke actually rose to the level of satire . The high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of `` Schoolhouse Rock '' on the subject of lobbying and the `` revolving door . '' It 's really a shame that the entire film could n't have been a musical . That would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun .",0

"This is a great `` small '' film . I say `` small '' because it doe n't have a hundred gun firing or a dozen explosion , a in a John Woo film . Great performance by Roy Scheider and the three `` bad guy '' . John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small production these day . The film is very easy to watch , the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine -- instead of everything going around and around , it seems a though thing just get worse a the plot thickens . Wonderful ending , very positive . I never read the Elmore Leonard book , but it ca n't be much different from the film because it FEELS like I 'm watching an Elmore Leonard movie .",1
"A very sensitive topic -- 15 y/o girl abandoned by mother a a baby and who go to visit her , continues to be ignored , is raped by her mom 's boyfriend , becomes pregnant . There wa not enough depth displayed of this situation . Too much of time is taken up on the chase with the trucker transporting the baby . ( Interesting , this baby with asthma -- you never see him cry -- except once -- , be fed , have is diaper changed during the whole truck transport ordeal . ) I would have liked to have seen more of the interrelationship , more focus on the fact that this girl wa a minor -- this should have stood up in court immediately . And this wa a true story ! It deserved a better telling than that ! ! If it were n't for the subject matter , I would have given this closer to a 0 rating . I rented this from the library . Only later I found out it wa a made for TV movie . oh well",0
"I 'm glad some people liked this , but I hated this film . It had a very good idea for a story line , but that 's where it ended . It wa badly written , badly acted and badly made . It had some interesting plot point , but they were just skipped over too fast , the writer needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bit , like lying about why she wa kidnapped , and ditch the dross . Instead it wa `` what 's going on ? `` , 5 second later they tell you . This film had no suspense , and I wa bored from start to end . I just wanted it to finish . Go and rent misery , or best laid plan if you want suspense or twist that keep you guessing to the end .",0

"This film stand head and shoulder above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedy . It is virtually flawless ! The writing , acting , production design , humor and pathos are all wonderful ! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivating and delightful ! Every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable , from the lead played by Cher and Nicolas Cage , to the many supporting role -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia , John Mahoney , Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack ! Each of these performer , plus Norman Jewison a Director , performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work . For several of the actor , this wa an early major exposure in film , so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouse whose career were altered by their effectiveness in this film . I 've seen this film several time all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially . More tellingly , I realized some year ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene wa compelling and beautifully crafted . There are so many stunning and memorable scene the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage character , where Cage tell his tale of woe ; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera , amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business ; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaison with co-worker : `` Do n't sh-t where you eat ! `` ; Danny Aiello at his dying mother 's bedside ; Nicolas Cage `` taking '' Cher a the rapture of an aria soar in the background ! There are of course many great romantic comedy , among them Sabrina ( both version , but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original ) ; When Harry Met Sally ; The Apartment . None quite equal Moonstruck !",1
"In many way , the filmic career of independent film-making legend John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock , the consummate studio director . Where Hitchcock infamously treated his actor a cattle , Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally . Where every element in a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately , Cassavetes cared le for the way a scene wa figuratively composed than in how it felt , or what it conveyed , emotionally . Hitchcock 's tale were always plot-first narrative , with the human element put in the background . Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his film . If some thing did not make much sense logically , so be it . One can see this even from his very first film , 1959 's Shadows , filmed with a 16mm hand-held camera , on a shoe string budget of about $ 40,000 , in Manhattan , with Cassavetes ' acting workshop repertory company , and touted a an improvisatory film . The story is rather simple , a it follows the life of three black sibling Manhattanites- Benny ( Ben Carruthers ) - a trumpeter and no account , Hugh ( Hugh Hurd ) - a washed up singer , and Lelia ( Lelia Goldoni ) - the younger sister of both . The film 's three main arc deal with Hugh 's failure a a nightclub crooner , and his friendship with his manager Rupert ( Rupert Crosse ) ; Benny 's perambulation in an about Manhattan with his two no account pal ; and Lelia 's lovelife- first with a white boy Tony ( Anthony Ray ) , who doe not realize light-skinned Lelia 's race , even after bedding her ; then with stiff and proper Davey ( Davey Jones ) , who may be a misogynist . In the first arc , nothing much happens , except dark-skinned Hugh get to pontificate on how degraded he feel to be singing in low class nightclub , and opening show for girly act . He dream of making it big in New York , or even Paris , but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill , for the one time we actually get to hear him sing , he show he 's a marginal talent , at best . That Rupert keep encouraging him give u glimpse into how destructive friendship work . But , this is the least important of the three arc . While this film is better overall than , say , Martin Scorsese 's first film , a decade later , Who 's That Knocking At My Door ? - another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers , it ha none of the brilliant moments- acting-wise nor cinematographically- that that film ha . It also is not naturalistic , for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve , especially in film , although the 1950s era Manhattan exterior , at ground level , is a gem to relive . While Shadows may , indeed , be an important film in regard to the history of the independent film circuit , it certainly is nowhere near a great film . Parts of it are preachy , poorly acted , scene end willy-nilly , almost like blackout sketch , and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle . All in all it 's a very sloppy job- especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film , a Cassavetes proved that a a director , at least in his first film , he wa a good actor . The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes ultimately got better with later film , and this give a clue a to his later working style . The National Film Registry ha rightly declared this film worthy of preservation a 'culturally significant ' . This is all in keeping with the credo of art Cassavetes long championed , a typified by this quote : ' I 've never seen an exploding helicopter . I 've never seen anybody go and blow somebody 's head off . So why should I make film about them ? But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way . I 've seen people withdraw . I 've seen people hide behind political idea , behind dope , behind the sexual revolution , behind fascism , behind hypocrisy , and I 've myself done all these thing . So I can understand them . What we are saying is so gentle . It 's gentleness . We have problem , terrible problem , but our problem are human problem . ' That this film is 'culturally significant ' is true , but that truth is not synonymous with it being 'artistically significant ' . It is in the difference between these two definition where great art truly thrives .",1

"This movie start out hilarious from about the 15 second mark , and continues it throughout the movie . I can not recall a scene where i did n't turn to look at people laughing with me . he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he look and the way he dressed . The comedic part were great to see from actor not very big or popular . As you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 7.9 on IMDb . i think it should be in 250 . Lets put it this way i have n't seen this funny of a movie since American pie or the original vacation . see it if you want a laugh . I give this movie 2 of the highest thumb up i have ever given since i found out about IMDb , great movie site .",1
"`` This story is dedicated to woman , '' according to the introduction , `` who have been fighting for their right ever since Adam and Eve started the loose-leaf system . '' When `` Politics '' wa filmed , the Nineteenth Amendment , guaranteeing woman the right to vote , wa only a decade old . And , the film deal with the wielding of political power by woman a a voting group . Advocating prohibition , and shutting down speakeasy , wa a main concern for woman at the time . Good-natured Marie Dressler ( a Hattie Burns ) becomes politically active , after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy . She want the liquor-selling joint closed ; and , is drafted into a Mayoral run , after delivering a powerful speech at a woman 's rally . Ms. Dressler is supported by her tenant , best friend Polly Moran ( a Ivy Higgins ) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates ( a Peter Higgins ) . Dressler 's run for Mayor of Lake City draw opposition from men in town ; so , Dressler order the woman to go on strike , denying them , `` everything '' in the `` parlor , bedroom , and bath . '' The film sound much better than it turned out . The humor , frankly , is n't too good ; and , it feature some unfunny and moderately offensive situation ( `` You look like Madame Queen '' refers to an Amos and Andy character ) . And , the mixing of shooting and slapstick doe n't mix well , this time .

"At the beginning of the film , you might double-check the DVD cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of time , but no worry . It 's NOT `` Memoirs of a Geisha '' that you purchased ; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it ha any right to be . Still , the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie , a it show how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catch his wife committing adultery . He decapitates the two lover before doing some hara-kiri ( ritual suicide through disembowelment ) . Cut to present day , when the American Ambassador in Japan welcome a befriended family and drive them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago . From then onwards , this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still make it somewhat exceptional . Let 's start with the good aspect , namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my all-time favorite British horror wench ( well , together with Britt Eckland , Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt ) . The bad aspect simply include that the screenplay is incoherent , imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twist that only evoke laughter . The restless spirit of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the body of the new tenant and causing them to do and say all sort of crazy stuff . The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susan 's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress ! In this `` possessed '' state , she even lure the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guest . So , strictly spoken , it 's not really `` evil '' that dwells in the house ; just a trio of sleazy ghost with dirty mind and far too much free time on their long-dead hand ! Obviously these scene are more comical than frightening , especially since the light-blue and transparent shape remind you of the cute ghost effect that were later popularized in `` Ghostbusters '' . `` The House Where Evil Dwells '' is probably the least scary ghost movie ever . Throughout most of the running time , you 'll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor ( who nevertheless made the excellent horror film `` Motel Hell '' and `` From Beyond the Grave '' ) intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top , like `` Motel Hell '' maybe . But then again , everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her line with a straight and sincere face , so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed . `` The House Where Evil Dwells '' is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doe n't even contain any grisly image apart from the massacre at the beginning . I am fully aware of how shallow it sound , but the two scene in which Susan George go topless are the only true highlight . Well , those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spider ( or are they crab ? ) in the daughter 's bedroom . How totally random and irrelevant wa that ? If you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding it bad reputation , make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep . Trivia note for horror buff : keep an eye open for the demon-mask that wa also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba .",0
"This is the follow-up creation to Better Off Dead . In a competition , Better Off Dead would win hands-down . But for star power , One Crazy Summer outshines Savage Steve 's better script . Problems with One Crazy Summer ( OCS ) : casting . Better Off Dead ( BOD ) wa cast so much better . Friendship : OCS show Cusack giving hateful look to Bill Murray 's little bro . Trouble on the set ? ? More outrageous friend in OCS , but more genuine friend in BOD . Plot wa good . You 'll predict some of it , but even the predictable part go further than you think they could . So , even though this is Better Off Dead 's ugly stepsister , it 's worth a look . See Demi Moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason . John Cusack fan , you got ta see it , just to say you have . If you do n't like Bobcat Golthwaite , I 'm sorry . I do n't like him either , but you ca n't escape him in this one . At least he doe a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster . Editing needed help on the beach , but for most part , not much to complain about . Overall , it 's good and funny . But try not to compare it to BOD or you 'll find it lacking . * sigh *",1
"If this film had a budget of 20 million I 'd just like to know where the money went . A monkey could make better CGI effect then what wa wasted for 3 hour on this dreadful piece of garbage , although I must admit the machine and the martian would have looked really , really cool on an original play-station 1 game , and early PC game from the mid 90 if a game had ever been made . What puzzle me is where did the money go ? Pendragon film could have made a great film with good old fashioned model and computer controlled camera a la George Lucas circa 1975-83 , and actor who actually look like they care about what they are doing ( or ruining in this case ) for about the same 20 million . This is quite possibly the worst film EVER made ! I would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this film again . I hated it completely ! I regress . I say this IS the WORST film EVER made because unlike other bad movie like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes , or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians , these are film that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them , you love them . There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it . I sold it to a guy for a dollar . I 'm betting the money for the film wa spent on booze and other vice for the cast and crew . Shame on you Pendragon film ! I want my money back !",0
"If you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic character , this is the one . The acting is superb , both from John Cassavetes a the insane paranoid whom , a the saying go , they REALLY ARE out to get , and from Peter Falk a his lifelong best friend to whom he turn for rescue . Big mistake , but since they 're both amoral mobster , and misogynistic bastard to boot , it 's hard to decide whom to root for LESS . Only writer/director Elaine May could have gotten away with this one . I thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD , he disclosed that the two star had `` very different idea '' about the script , that the director wa nearly impossible to work with , that the director of photography had impossible demand made of him , that the crew wa constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting , and so on . This mood of one big VERY dysfunctional family come across clearly on the screen .",0
"Good , boring or bad ? It 's good . Worth your money ? If you can spare it for a ticket , sure . Better than the trailer make it seem ? Yes , oddly . There is n't much to the script - Guards working at armored truck company move vast amount of cash . Guards see opportunity to retire a millionaire , one of them is too honest to go along with it all , and a well-laid plan go to hell . This could have been a poorly-executed Reservoir Dogs ripoff , but the skill of the cast and the director 's ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto a solid footing .",1
The movie seemed a little slow at first . But it picked up speed and got right to the point . It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reason of the `` gadget '' . I enjoyed it . It is very close to reality a any movie about the Atomic Bombs that were to be dropped on Japan . I have recommended it to friend . I wa particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz .,1
"My rating refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG-1 which are wonderfully fresh , creative and addicting . When the cast stepped through the gate , you never knew what lay on the other side ! Starting around Season 5 , the show took a different focus - still good , but different . The series follows the adventure of a team of human ( and one alien ) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the `` Stargate '' . The backstory of the series is based on the character and event of the movie `` Stargate '' in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt . The episode are light ( innocent and easy to watch ) and very creative . Many of the inventive story could easily have been made into great sci-fi movie of their own . What happens next wa always unpredictable . The character on which the show rest are also well-defined and brilliantly performed . Their tone is serious , but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor . They are simply fun to watch . Starting somewhere around Season 5 , the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe ( the Goa'uld , then the Ori ) . The plot become more complex ( a lot more political/strategic oriented ) and interdependent . The character were still a great a ever but the show wa different in nature . One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episode that commemorated the 100th and 200th episode . They are simply can't-miss show . They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 season . If you are a sci-fi fan , watch a few episode of the first 4 Seasons and you 'll likely be hooked . If you like evolving story line between two opposing side , you have 10 season of show to look forward to .",1
"This movie should have never been made . What a shame of the budget . Please hire convincing actor , and make a proper movie . Very thin plot , and unconvincing line . Almost hilarious , and that is a shame for an action movie .... Definitely not worth watching . They keep replaying the same `` shot '' of an Stealth airplane flying away . You have seen it one , and that wa not worth re-running 3 or 4 time . It is time for Steven Seagal to retire from movie-making . His movie are getting worser every time .

"Idea is great , spoiled big time by the judge . Why make fun of people ? if what the inventor say is true , and a most of them say , they spent their life saving on the invention , the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the people . also , it show when they want to accept an idea by the crier that they added to the judge .

"Late night on BBC1 , wa on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary-set Irish film so I stayed to watch for a few minute and then stayed to the end . I have to admit that the main attraction wa the only English actress , Kelly Reilly , who is stunning to look at . This is billed a a black comedy , which is one of the hardest thing to pull off . It should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laugh so that in the end you do n't know why you 're laughing - for me Martin Scorsese 's After Hours ( 1985 ) is the best example . Dead Bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattle along and spiral down towards further blackness . I did n't spot the final twist in the tale a some other poster here did so I wa suitably surprised . As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003 , it all seems rather worthy ; it doe n't look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make it money back . The script could 've been a whole lot sharper but the acting wa on the whole pretty good . I 'm glad I watched it , flaw and all , tho I do n't think I learnt much about Ireland today , especially their policing method !",1
"Hi , I 'm a friend of werewolf movie , and when i saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelf i wa like `` hmm , simple and nice name to it at least . Althou ... i wonder why i have n't heard of it before . '' First of all , the movie start with tit . Lots of tit . Tits are pretty much all this movie budget went to . Who care about a werewolf effect , just pay the actress enough to get topless shot ! So , about the mysterious darkwolf character ( a little spoiler ahead , but who really care ... ) He 's your average everyday biker . Not even super-tough looking , but like the old wise woman say in the movie `` he is far more powerful and dangerous than you 've ever faced before . '' Just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy . Pretty original . I even had look twice when they first used the `` red glowing eye '' SPECIAL EFFECT ! I mean my god , that `` lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer '' effect ha been used since the seventy . It look plain ugly here ! And do n't get me started with the werewolf 3D-CGI . As said before , like an bad and old video game . And finally , a i do like werewolf film , like i said . They prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own . Darkwolf doe build the werewolfworld a well , about some silly legend of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline . BUT . It almost instantly after creating the rule of engagement `` the darkwolf kill anyone the girl ha touched '' start random-slashing . Which just doe n't make any sense , why even bother telling u the rule of killing , when they are n't even gon na play by them ... Aplus the wolf-point-of-view shot are made with a sony handycam or something , filming mostly the floor and wall . Just add growling noise and you 've got a super werewolf effect . The gore is partially OK . But when the wolf slash everyone with an open hand , just by basically laying the hand on top of the victim , it just doe n't do the trick for me ... Truly , WHO give money to make these heap of junk straight-to-video horrortitles , they are n't even funny-kind of bad movie , just sad .",0
"I had noticed this movie had been on Cinemax a lot lately , so this morning , I decided to watch it .

It 's slow , the pacing is horrible , it feel a tho it last 4 hour . There 's no real plot to speak of ... agh ! How can anyone say anything good about this movie . Rickman is good ... but he always is ... the other two character work well , but there 's no real story to support any of it . After 2 hour , and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on , where on earth is the plot- it end with a surprise that frankly just made me sick . Do n't bother with this one .",0
"Tenchu aka . Hitokiri- directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs ( together with Goyokin , HAra Kiri & Rebellion ) to the best chambara movie existing . Its the story about Shintaro Katsu ( who play Okada Izo ) working for Nakadei , who want to become the daymio . Okada , being the `` cleaner '' for Nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to Nakadei . But there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( Tenchu mean Heavens Punishment )",1
"Wow , did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise ! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden , Abraham Lincoln is floating around in space and welcome the Enterprise ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Is it just me , or is this a really lame-brained idea ? ! Lincoln come aboard and they welcome them . Abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet , where they meet other famous dead folk -- both good and evil . It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster ha assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle it out for supremacy . The whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair , a the GOOD side is saddled with Surak -- a Vulcan who make Gandhi seem like Rambo ! ! Despite a totally AWFUL premise , the action is pretty good and it 's great to see overhead shot of obvious double fighting it out in this grudge match . But , do n't mistake this for high art or deep sci-fi . The bottom line is that the series wa on it last leg a a first-run series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise .",0
"This pile of sh ! t is tied in my book a the worst thing ever made . I ca n't BELIEVE that someone actually relased this CRAP , let alone acually MADE it . HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE . Not even worth mentioning the damn story or any detail about it . THAT 's how bad it actually is . Avoid it like SARS !",0
"All the kid aged from 14-16 want to see this movie ( although you are only allowed at 18 ) . They have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it . I feel very sad kid ca n't see what a good movie is , and what a bad movie is . This wa one of the worst movie i saw in month . Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie . And the end ? It 's an open ending ... why ? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story . This movie is just made to make you scared , and if you are a bit smart and know some about music , you exactly know when you 'll be scared . When the movie wa finished and i turned to my friend and told ( a bit to loud ) him that this wa a total waste of money , some stupid kid looked strange at me . These day i could make an Oscar with a home-video of my goldfish , if only i use the right marketing .",0
"Claire Denis 's movie seem to fall into one of two category : the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate . `` L'Intrus '' definitely fall into the first category , but it 's not so awful a `` Trouble Every Day '' or `` J'ai pa sommeil . '' Now , ever since I saw `` Chocolat , '' I 've made it a point to see every new movie Denis make . And I have always been disappointed . `` L'Intrus '' wa no exception . She ha yet to make a movie a personal and a moving a her first one . You get a lot of the Denis regular : an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lip , the gap between her teeth , her ample cleavage , and a couple of nice coat ; the black guy from `` Trouble Every Day '' and `` J'ai pa sommeil , '' Grégoire Colin , and that Lithuanian or Russian girl . Michel Subor 's character wa interesting enough , but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and wa relieved when , somewhere in Korea , I think , he finally got it cut . There wa certainly some action -- gruesome murder , a man 's search for a son -- and there may even have been a plot , but one viewing wa n't enough to figure it out , and two viewing are , I fear , out of the question . For one thing , the score wa jarring and obtrusive ( a in `` Beau Travail '' ) . For another , the season changed too abruptly , leaving you even more confused about what wa going on . Oh , there were a few pretty shot , and if you liked `` Friday Evening '' with it shot of the fold in heavy drape and bedsheets , you might appreciate the aesthetic of `` L'Intrus . '' Otherwise , steer clear . I saw this movie in French and it 's possible I missed something crucial . But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amount to more than five page , double spaced and with ample margin . In `` Chocolat '' the silence is sublime ; in `` L'Intrus , '' it 's just dull .",0
"This film wa on last week and although at that time of the day ( around 6pm ) the quality of the movie is almost never good ( at least here on Mexican TV ) , I could n't switch the TV off . The story about Madelene Moore really touch you . She doe n't come across a a very sympathetic character at first , but seeing the whole film , you just want her so succeed . This film really leaf you thinking . And i think that basically due to the great acting of Brooke Johnson . I had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film , but this wa great great acting . Compliments to Brooke . I hope to see her in another film soon .",1
"I agree with the other comment . I saw this movie year ago . Christopher Plummer is hilarious a a dandy . The ribaldry is unsurpassed . If this come out on video , I will definitely buy it .",1
"I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and wa impressed with it , despite the lack of excitement in the plot . The acting wa very good by everyone involved . Amy Madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired , yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter 's condition . Yet , in the process , she ha neglected her older sister , who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism . The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary role . Christopher Lloyd , in a very understated role , show u why he ha such versatility . He play a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research , yet starved for a meaningful relationship . He and Madigan connect very well in their scene together , yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship . Their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant , an acting lesson for aspiring performer . And in a small role , Fred Savage is fun to watch . You can tell why this movie wa based on a play , it 's probably very good on stage . On screen , it 's not particularly exciting , but it 's nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in it subtlety .",1
"Still the definitive program about the Second World War , The World At War is n't just long , but also very informative . The series contains 26 episode ( each episode last for about 45 min . ) , and includes the event leading up to and following in the wake of the war . Most episode are about the war in Europe , and there are several episode about the war in the Pacific . Other episode include information about the war in Africa , Burma , the Atlantic and the home front of Germany , Great Britain , United States and Soviet Union . There is one episode that 's dedicated to the Holocaust . The series start off with the episode A New Germany ( 1933-1939 ) , and tell about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gain prior to the outbreak of war . The series end with the episode Remember ; the war 's influence in a post-war world . Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program . Every episode begin with a short introduction and then with opening credit . The credit are accompanied by a powerful music theme . There are many fitting music piece throughout the series . Each episode is like a mini-film . The footage is fantastic , and so is the way it wa put together . In addition , some of the footage is in color . The information included also make the episode memorable and entertaining . The series wa produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television ( UK ) . Commissioned in 1969 , it took four year to produce , such wa the depth of it research . The series wa narrated by Laurence Olivier ( one of the most famous and revered actor of the 20th century ) . The series interviewed leading member of the Allied and Axis campaign , including eyewitness account by civilian , enlisted men , officer and politician , amongst them Albert Speer , Karl Donitz , Jimmy Stewart , Bill Mauldin , Curtis LeMay , Lord Mountbatten , Alger Hiss , Toshikazu Kase , Arthur Harris , Charles Sweeney , Paul Tibbets , Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose . Jeremy Isaacs say in `` The Making of The World at War '' that he sought to interview , not necessarily the surviving big name , but their aide and assistant . The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed , according to Isaacs , wa Heinrich Himmler 's adjutant , Karl Wolff . The latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler 's presence . The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War . Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form . In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 , voted for by industry professional , The World at War ranked 19th . The program ha everything that the viewer need to know about the war . After watching a few episode I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episode one after the other . I 've seen some of them several time . There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer . One is called The Great War ( 1964 ) that 's about World War I . The other is called Cold War ( 1998 ) that 's about the Cold War obviously .",1
"I have seen 'The Sea Within ' today and I loved it . The actor of the movie are wonderful ( specially Javier Bardem , of course ) , but I thought that Belén Rueda would have a better role . Lola Dueñas , Clara Segura and , specially , Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretation . And I can not forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau ( brother and father of the protagonist ) . There are two technical aspect I loved very much : Aguirresarobe 's photography and the score by Amenábar himself . I liked the song , 'Negra sombra ' ( 'Dark Shadow ' ) , by Luz Casal with music of Carlos Núñez . In short , I think that the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within ' in order to compete in the Oscar Awards . I liked other Spanish production , such a Almodóvar 's 'Bad Education ' , but Amenábar 's film is much better than them . 'The Sea Within ' deserves all the award .",1
"As someone who ha read the book , I can say that this is vastly inferior to the big American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow . There are various reason for this . Firstly , Emma is too unpleasant . Yes , she ha fault , and is n't the easiest person to like - but the viewer should n't downright start to despise her . Secondly , Mr Knightly is miscast . His brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen , and throw the mood of the whole affair `` off '' . Thirdly , Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet ; and why wa she made to look so sickly ? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look a if she 's going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene . Fourthly , the structure ha been mucked up and scene cut . At the end , when Emma decides she love Mr Knightly , it come across a utterly baffling because this narrative ha n't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film . Fifthly , what wa going on , exactly , with Mrs Elton 's accent ? She went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning , to all out American half-way through , and then back to English at the end . Finally , this dragged at the end . The book and the big film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly . This version drag on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing u the ceremony . All in all , a rather haphazard attempt . Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead",0
"I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's film . Most of his 80 gore film had their moment , but often came across a second-rate Dario Argento imitation . With the exception of the entertaining `` Zombi '' ( which wa a George Romero imitation ) , I did n't really enjoy them . I know Italian horror often disregard the plot , but the storyline and character in his film were just far too thread bare even by the standard . This is why `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' surprised me . Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery . Its possibly the best giallo ever made , only seriously rivaled by Dario Argento 's entry into the genre . And unlike Fulci 's previous giallo `` A Lizard in a Woman 's Skin '' , this never drag . Fulci 's direction here is quite good . He keep the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer 's interest throughout . Also , the conclusion to the mystery come a a complete surprise to the audience . Plus , he add some clever touch , such a the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence . Overall , the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story . The acting is good for the most part also , full of familiar face from 70 Italian exploitation cinema . Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool throughout . The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan , whose performance is just far too over-the-top . Its the only laughable aspect of the film . `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' definitely come with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre a a whole . ( 8/10 )",1
This film without doubt is one of the worst I have seen . It wa so boring that I simply could not wait for it to end . I talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good review and after even 30 min in she looked at me a if to say `` your nut '' The scenery wa a boring a the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bit of bush around . The acting wa un-inspiring and the film wa simply a waste of what have been a good idea into a waste of a dvdr . Guy Pierce should have stuck to neighbour a at least he washed his hair . All he done wa talk on his phone but yet sold nothing a a salesman . He would have been sacked week before . His girlfriend ( once in Coyote Ugly ) should have remained dancing on the bar a at least she looked hot in that . The guy who played Vincent ( those who watched know ) wa so annoying with his phone call that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2 . I do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it . I actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture I went through .,0
"Unlike another user who said this movie sucked ( and that Olivia Hussey wa terrible ) , I disagree . This movie wa amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! Olivia Hussey is awesome in everything she 's in ! Yeah she may be older now , because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet , but she 's wonderful ! This story line may be used quite often , but it 's a unique movie and I 'll fight back on anyone who disagrees ! I enjoyed this movie just a much a I have any other Olivia Hussey movie . Olivia 's `` my girl '' and I love her work . I saw this for the first time on Saturday ( 4/14/07 ) and fell in love with it . Not only because 's it 's an Olivia movie , but because of it 's unique story line and wonderful direction .",1
"If you speak French or can put up with sub-titles , you will really enjoy this movie . If on the other hand you just want to see God 's most beautiful creature , this is a must see . Not an ounce of silicon in sight . Zalman King eat your heart out . Sophie Marceau 's body is the epitome of perfection and everything I had ever fantasized about . Her part is even in English . Even the fact that she wa nude with John Malkovich did not detract for her beauty . Sophie is a ten if ever there wa one . Chiara Caselli and Inés Sastre are 9.5s . Oh yeah , it is a pretty good story . Several little vignette are woven together in a sort of Six Degrees of Separation style .",1
"This is the first porn I 've ever tried to review . It demand a different approach than usual , since the allegory will not reward dissection . `` I 'm American . I 'm a prudish virgin . '' `` We are European . We are cultured and sex-mad . '' `` It is nice when we all screw each other . '' Lots to talk about ! Well , there kind of is in fact , relative to your average 60 topless volleyball number anyway . And the enervating patina of 'class ' at least delivers clean , detailed composition . But what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn ? OK then : the only scene I really ( rhetorically ) got off on wa the first time Brigitte Maier step in . There are effort to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other ; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus . And multiple take or not , one perhaps undescribable-on-IMDb act doe look like it wa partially simulated by a surgical hose . Still , I stayed awake , and it wa eight in the morning ... but what doe the last shot mean ? !",0
"I have seen many many movie and this just totally blew my mind . The trauma , the suspense is just amazing . I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it , and relating it to reality . Movies that play and challenge your mind are movie you do n't forget , those that make you doubt your reality . A problem could be the quality , but that doe n't bring down the essence of the movie . The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaf you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer . I just totally loved it ! So many clue and twitch and puzzle . One of the best movie ever , hand down .",1
"This film stand a one of the most amazing example of compelling and artful film-making I 've every seen . Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter 's story , a well a his endearing personal character . By the end of the film , I wa left wishing that I 'd had the opportunity to meet Dieter before his passing . On a technical note , the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful . The narrative is intricately woven , with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic event . Few documentary director have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character . This film is a must see ! ! !",1
"A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampire . The only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivor . Released in 1993 , `` Darkness '' garnered something of a cult following upon release . It 's easy to see why-it 's loaded ( and I mean freaking loaded ) with gore , and it 's energy and enthusiasm , like that found in other no-budget cult horror flick like `` The Dead Next Door '' and `` The Children of Ravensback '' , is actually rather infectious . While that may be true , that 's sadly not enough to save it . The film wa shot on a Super 8 , so the image is grainy and dark , making thing very difficult to see ( it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonist dreadful mullet . ) Also grating is the soundtrack , made up of annoying Casio Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal ( seriously , what is it with these no budget horror flick and bad Death Metal ? ) While one is n't expecting Oscar worthy performance , the acting is still strictly amateur hour , a the actor sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened . In the end , I 'm sure fan of no-budget gorefests will love this . Everyone else though , will wish there wa a little more meat on the rib .",0
"I can understand after watching this again for the first time in many year how it is considered one of the worst Laurel & Hardy 's . For me , it is n't a close to a bad a `` Air Raid Wardens '' and `` The Bullfighters '' , but there are some definite huge flaw in it . The film is set up to show Laurel and Hardy a the owner and instructor of the dance studio . Hardy is funny a the prancing lead of a `` London Bridge '' dance , surrounded by 20th Century Fox starlet , while in the next room , Laurel teach the beginner ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit . A clumsy carpenter spill glue on the floor , leading to a predicable gag where Hardy end up the looser . Then , in come the racketeer , now selling insurance covering up their protection racket . One of them is a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum . But no sooner do they bully the boy into buying insurance , they are arrested . This is the end of the gangster and the last time we see the dance studio . The rest of the film is devoted to Laurel and Hardy 's support of wealthy patron Trudy Marshall and her inventor boyfriend , Robert Bailey . They first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parent ( Matt Briggs and Margaret Dumont ) and hopeful suitor Allan Lane , whom we can tell right off is a no-good swine . This lead to Briggs ' hidden bar being revealed to tea-totaling Dumont , and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crash his bed into a pond below . When Bailey us the boy to help display his ray gun , pandemonium ensues . The dead-pan butler announces to Case and Dumont that their house is on fire . Later , Hardy want to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hope to get Laurel to break a leg to do so . There is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesman were gangster and that the policy would probably be invalid . ( Even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman , after being arrested , their license would have been revoked ) . Laurel end up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog ( only a frosting covered , cake devouring Toto look-alike , or possibly the actual pooch ) , causing Oliver to end up on a huge beach roller-coaster that somehow the bus ha ended up on , perfectly fitting it wheel onto the track . Roller-coaster gag can be exciting , a evidenced in `` Abbott and Costello Go to Hollywood '' , and this one is amusing but anticlimactic . As the story wrap up , all of these gag seem to have no point , giving the impression that this wa simply a series of one-reelers put together to make a full-length feature , hopefully part of a double bill . L & H , a I 've mentioned in other review of their later film , had lost much of their luster after leaving Hal Roach 's employ , but surprisingly here , they do not come off a old and tired looking a they had in film made in the same year . Had the gag not been a amusing , a wa the case with some of their other film , this surely would have ranked a `` 2 '' a opposed to a `` 3 '' .",0
Sadly it wa misguided . This movie stunk from start to finish . It wa hard to watch because I used to watch Clarissa Explains It All every day on Nickelodeon . I LOVED her . Then the next thing I found she did a spread in Maxim and she wa gorgeous ! I have n't really heard anything about her until I watched this movie on accident . I could n't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it . Everything about it wa wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team wa trying really really hard to save a sunk ship . Too bad .. I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie .,0
"If you have beloved actor , Peter Falk , Rip Torn , George Segal , and Bill Cobbs , you do n't need Billy Burke , Coolio , or any other distraction . Massive talent is totally wasted in `` Three Days to Vegas '' , with the blame falling squarely on the script . My neighbor 's vacation film are about a interesting a this misguided road movie . If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script , check out `` The Crew '' . There really are no redeeming factor here , and watching these wonderful actor struggling with such weak material is a crime . I wanted to like it , but the shallow script cheat the audience , by essentially giving the actor nothing to work with . - MERK",0
"I just ca n't understand the negative comment about this film . Yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just fly by . Henstridge ( talk about winning the gene-pool lottery ! ) is a magnetic and alluring a ever ( who say the golden age of cinema is dead ? ) and Vartan hold his own . There is simmering chemistry between the two lead ; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lot ! It is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together ... Ignore the negative comment - if you are feeling a bit blue , watch this flick , you will feel so much better . If you are already happy , then you will be euphoric .

"ROCK STAR / ( 2001 ) * * * ( out of four ) By Blake French : '' Rock Star '' is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame , only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it . We have seen all this before ( in better movie ) , but this human story doe capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge . It garner a recommendation because of it visualization of the atmosphere . The script , by `` Crazy/Beautiful '' director John Stockwell , portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doe n't explain what it is about , it show u . `` Rock Star , '' originally titled `` Metal God , '' star Mark Wahlberg a Chris `` Izzy '' Cole , a Pittsburgh office supply salesperson who dream of becoming Bobby Beers , the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group , Steel Dragon . Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution , instead of writing his own song , he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon , and only in the exact way they perform them . His group becomes irritated with Chris ' obsession and give him the boot . This devastates Chris , a well a his supportive parent and faithful girlfriend , Emily ( Jennifer Aniston from TV 's `` Friends '' ) . He then receives a phone call . It 's the Steel Dragon band . They have seen Chris ' tape and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer . In an instant , Chris rocket into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star . Unfortunately , it 's not a rewarding a he expected . A true story inspired the `` Rock Star '' concept . An Ohio supply salesman , Tim `` Ripper '' Owens , really did replace Rob Halford , the lead singer in Judas Priest , after initially singing for a tribute band . The rest of the film is probably fiction , although most of what happens must represent the experience of many other band . The film detail the various ordeal of being a rock star . It explores the aspect of touring , personality difference , the danger of drug abuse and violence , struggling relationship , sexual freedom , dishonesty , and the extreme measure of the producer all to please the fan and keep popularity high . I have seen all of Mark Wahlberg 's movie , and this is the first that ha earned my affection . Wahlberg , a former singer/model , ha made movie like `` Fear , '' `` Boogie Nights '' `` Three Kings , '' and most recently Tim Burton 's lacking remake `` Planet of the Apes . '' I am starting to admire the young actor more and more . Although he ha not performed in many successful film , he ha taken many chance , and done a variety of role . `` Rock Star '' is his best film to date . I ca n't think of many actor who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole 's struggle and aspiration . Wahlberg truly make `` Rock Star '' rock . Jennifer Aniston light up the screen a well . She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation . It 's tragic of what happens to their relationship . We care about these character a great deal . During the film concert scene , director Stephen Herek ( who also directed `` Holy Man '' and the live action version of `` 101 Dalmatians '' ) creates a gripping atmosphere . He capture the scene with an intense urgency , and a raw , unmistakable energy . The musical number provide the film with the best , most involving scene . Unfortunately Herek can not sustain the energy and zest throughout . At the three-quarters mark , he loos the spark a the movie becomes dull and unpleasant . I understand where the story need to go in order to portray the negative side of fame , but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it . In `` Almost Famous , '' a much better film about rock and roll , there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scene . Here , it feel a if the filmmaker lose their passion . The message come a bit too late and suddenly in the story . The film turn into a morality tale that want to provide u with a sappy destination . The filmmaker might a well stop everything , appear on screen and say : `` now audience , the moral of the story is '' We understand the theme , but it 's too instantaneous . The personal discovery for Chris ' must be gradual . Fortunately , all of this happens in the last twenty-five minute of the film , hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minute of a reasonably good feature . `` Rock Star '' is not a great movie-see `` Almost Famous '' if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for Marky Mark , it 's a turning point in his career .",1
"I just found out before writing this review that `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' and another movie called `` Curse of the Komodo '' were both directed by the same guy , Jim Wynorski . That might explain why they are film of nearly identical premise . They both feature a military-governed island , a colonel whose concerned more about covering his track than the life of his employee , people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island , and giant komodo dragon created through genetic experiment running amok . What difference are there ? Well , the intruder on the island are now capitalist wanting to expose the government secret and there 's a giant cobra on the island a well , hence the title `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' even though the conflict between the two monster is hardly relevant to the 'story . ' `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' is more or le what you 'd expect given it title and it channel origin : the Sci-Fi Channel . Although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you ( I liked a movie called `` Komodo '' ) I hardly doubt this one will . `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' is not only a boring film , but it 's also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi flick I 've seen in a long time . In some of these movie , there is an air to them that indicates the filmmaker were giving at least a certain level of effort , but I see very little here . That 's indicated again by it just being a rehash of `` Curse of the Komodo . '' The CGI for the monster look a if they came straight out of a second-rate video game , the cinematography and misc en scene is poor , the acting range from passable to poor , the action scene are dull , and then there are some part that are , frankly put , unforgivably bad . I see a lot movie where a person will shoot a gun many time without reloading and I can deal with this . But in this movie , where Michael Paré take a single thirty-eight handgun and fire it approximately fifty time nonstop without reloading once well , at first I laughed , but even then it just became tiring . That would be the 'action . ' A monster appears , people scream , Paré fire nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture , and somebody get eaten . `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' is a very bad movie . The only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named Michelle Borth , who is not only very beautiful , but a surprisingly strong performer . Even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she wa given , Michelle Borth managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress a good a her can get stuck in a film a junky a this . She obviously took it for the paycheck , but it wo n't boost her career any , I 'm afraid .",0
"Yes , it feel , and for the most part play like an `` after school special '' , for a slightly more adult audience , alright maybe a teen audience . But add in Bill Murray ( already showing some dramatic a well a his usual comedic talent ) , a nice supporting cast , and an unexpected sweetness about growing up , and remembering those great , or not so great day at summer camp , and you get a heartwarming , funny , sleeper hit . It doe get a little too smarmy for it own good , but that is also one of it charm . When you hear the title `` Meatballs '' , and see the poster , you expect a teenage sex romp , but what you get is a sentamental , yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative year at summer camp . The sentamentality , and the remberances of simpler time reminds me of `` A Christmas Story '' , which I also love . The rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated . The only movie I 've seen that come close , is `` Indian Summer '' , which I like almost a much a `` Meatballs '' , and also star Matt Craven . Let 's hope he completes the trilogy . Maybe he could come back for `` Return of the Meatballs '' , and bring some dignity back to the franchise ( Meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic ) . `` Meatballs '' is easily on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time ( not really guilty either ) . It 's a wonderful little film , that always make me smile .",1
"I think this show is screamingly funny ! It 's not for every taste , and I 'm not going to elevate or denigrate the folk that do n't get it . I 'm sure they 're wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength . But if you like it , you REALLY like it . Sarah play a self-infatuated loser named `` Sarah Silverman '' who often find her self in Homerian predicament ( that 's `` Homerian '' a in `` Homerian Simpsonian '' ) . I remember Sarah Silverman from her brief gig on Saturday Night Live in the early 90 's . I liked her immediately then and I go out of my way to check out anything she 's done . This show is choke-on-your-food-and-wet-your-pants funny . Therefore I always fast before watching it and wear adult diaper . Check it out !",1
"Okay , so there is a front view of a Checker taxi , probably late 1930s model . It ha the great triangular shaped headlight . There also is a DeSoto cab in this black and white , character driven , almost a musical love gone wrong story . The real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interior and fashion and hotel elevator . The hair style , male and female are gorgeous . If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature 's hair she could have made it big . There is an artist loft that would be the envy of every Andy Warhol wannabe . If you watch this expecting a great Casablanca storyline or Sound of Music oom-pah-pah , you will be disappointed . There is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film . My copy on DVD with another movie for $ 1 wa very viewable . The title sequence wa cute but not up there with Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World or The Pink Panther . This wa an RKO movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that RKO used to use . I liked Victor Mature in One Million , B.C. , and Sampson and Delilah and especially in Violent Saturday . See if you can find that one . He wa wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox . Richard Carlson went on to do I Led Three Lives on TV in the early 1950s . Vic Mature wa offered the part of Sampson 's father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah . He supposedly wa asked if he would have any problem playing the part of the father since he wa so well known a Sampson . Victor replied , `` If the money is right , I 'll play Sampson 's mother .

"The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece . The first sequel , Jailhouse 41 , wa not quite a good in my opinion , though it 's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style . Director Shunya Ito ha managed to do the same thing again with this film ; the story is a bit different here , but still he 's managed to take what made the previous entry excellent and better than many film of this type and craft something fairly original around it . Again the action focus on Nami Matsushima ( a.k.a . `` Scorpion '' ) and this time she 's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back . After escaping from pursuing police officer , one thing lead to another and Scorpion find herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother . The prostitute end up getting impregnated by the retarded brother ( ... ) , while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison . But Scorpion doe n't like spending time behind bar and it 's not long before she 's back to doing what she doe best . The film get off to a great start a we see Scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail . From there , however , the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable end up being more of a drama than the previous two film . That 's not to say that there is n't still plenty of action - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode ' and the film is n't exactly short on general sleaze . Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role a the sinister title character and it 's another understated , almost wordless performance . Her screen presence is great , however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically . The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all build into a crescendo of revenge . There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section take up a fairly large part of the film . There 's a few surreal sequence , not a many a in the first film and nowhere near a in the second , but the film stay in with the rest of the series on that point . Overall , I would say this film is between the first two in term of quality - not a great a the original and slightly better than the second .",1
"1 thing . this movie suck BIG TIME .. i wa into singaporean comedy when Chiken Rice war came along . But , this time , even Gurmit Singh ( well-done ) acting cant pull this one of . A total failure of following HK 's Shaolin Soccer . Next time : do ur own thing !",0
"Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the little family move in , a the father have got a new job in a computer company there . But no paradise would be complete without it snake . Strange thing happens a the family join the local country club without the husband , a it certainly hold secret . The father is not a joiner , but pressure is on him to join , a everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are member . Robert Urich 's good guy part is a bit tepid , but Joanna Cassidy a good natured housewife turning nasty sizzle . Suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci a club chairperson . Look out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a bit part a a valet . The movie capture the sense of paranoia and the special effect final is worth waiting for . I have seen this movie quite a few time .",1
"Neil Simon 's THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later play . Felix Unger and Oscar Madison were the unsuitably paired roommate in the original , the former being picky and neat , the latter being slovenly and loose . Simon would rewrite ( le successfully ) the play in the 1990s a THE NEW ODD COUPLE , with female roommate . He made it a mixed couple ( a woman with her daughter , and a man ) in THE GOODBYE GIRLS . He also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with THE SUNSHINE BOYS , a Broadway hit starring Jack Alberson and Sam Levine a Al Lewis and Willie Clark , the aged , semi-retired Vaudevillians . Here the `` apartment '' problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who ca n't stand each other . The 1976 film starred Walter Matthau a Willie , and George Burns a Al . In actuality , Al probably doe not think totally badly of Willie - Willie is pathological on the subject of Al . First Al had little habit , such a accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing word beginning with the letter `` t '' , and slightly jabbing Willie with his index finger , on stage . Secondly , Al retired when his wife died . Willie wa not ready to retire ( and ha been forcing his nephew and agent , Ben ( Richard Benjamin ) to try to get him job in commercial . But Willie ca n't remember line unless they are funny , and keep flubbing them . So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial . Ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy . He doe bring Al to see Willie , and the spark begin flying , a neither can figure out what the other is doing ( and this is just in rehearsal . On top of that , Willie is insisting on change ( minor one , but they throw off Al ) such a saying `` ENTER ! ! ! '' when Al knock on the door . The initial rehearsal is a failure , but Ben manages to get them to the taping of the show . The question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will Willie wring Al 's neck ? The three lead , Matthau , Burns , and Benjamin , do very well with the one-liner , frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter ( example : `` Chest pain ... I 'm getting chest pain Uncle Willie . Every Thursday I come here and get chest pain ! '' `` So , come on Fridays ! '' ) . Benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle , although Matthau 's rough outer shell make it difficult ( he only smooth down when he discus the glory day of vaudeville ) . Matthau ha a little better grasp on reality ( at first ) than Burns , who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality Matthau 's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him le willing to behave properly . Burns is not senile - he take thing slowly . But he seems far happier in accepting his retirement . I call this a final `` Voyage of Discovery '' for our modern Lewis and Clark . Al and Willie transcend their old skit , a they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought . Even the irascible Willie admits that Al may be ( to him ) a pain in the as , but he wa a funny man . Burns wa not the original choice for the part of `` Al Lewis '' ( supposedly Dale of the team Smith and Dale ) . Jack Benny wa . Benny probably would have done a good job , but ill-health forced him out ( he died in 1975 ) . Burns ( whose last involvement in any film wa in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 a the narrator ) turned in such a fine performance that he got the `` Oscar '' for best supporting actor , and wa to have a career in movie in the next decade in such film a OH GOD ! ; OH GOD , YOU DEVIL ; and GOING IN STYLE . He died in 1996 age 100 , having proved that he wa more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife Gracie Allan .",1
"This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just a stupid and wasteful a politician . From a ( silly ) play by Tennessee Williams and directed ( with a dead hand ) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967 . The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief . Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that ha allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set . The shrill antic of a screeching Taylor , Burton 's half asleep wandering , the loony dialog , Noel Coward laughing at himself , the ridiculous story and plot device and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer . BOOM is a disgrace , a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiot just like the rest of the planet 's pleb . Not even fun . Just terrible and mad shocking waste .",0
This film is self indulgent rubbish . Watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack . Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed . It should be charming but is n't - it 's just irritating . The character are difficult to care about and the acting is poor . The story within the film are also charmless and sinister . I wa expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter . It is rarely that I can not see a film through to it conclusion but this one got the better of both of u . Although the film is set in current time it ha the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War . There is n't even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it . A real shame because a a film this is an embarrassment to Scotland .,0
"A plot that is dumb beyond belief . However , that said , it must be admitted the lead actor go at their role a though it were Shakespeare . And that is a it should be . It is n't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma . Hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by Joanna Kerns . She prof that just because it is n't on the page doe n't mean a role ca n't be seized and dug into . And she doe so with gusto . Good for her . Ditto to Christine Elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy , but go way beyond what is asked of her by the script . And to Grant Show a well . A graduate of daytime and prime time soap ( Ryan 's Hope , Melrose Place ) . He is always versatile and underrated . His primary drawback seems to be his impossible-to-ignore good look . He is a sturdy , well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do . The rest of the cast is basically window dressing . The direction is adequate and the script , a I alluded to , is fairly idiotic . Watch this one to enjoy three good actor in the lead taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing . It 's fun .",0
"Excellent movie in many aspect . Vicente Aranda ha succeeded in depicting the time ( 1830 ) with meticulous care . The light , the place , the feeling , are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie . And along with it -in opposite to what happened to `` Mad Love '' ( Juana la Loca ) , a rather episodic historical movie- all of this beautiful photography/ music/ clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reach it climax in the only possible way . Concerning the actor , Paz Vega a Carmen is outstanding : liar , seductive , agressive , totally sexual , so beautiful Carmen . Sbaraglia is a little le convincing the audience about his instant mad love for Carmen , but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie . I recommend it to everyone : the best spanish movie of the year .",1
"As a premise , this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise . However , director Eric Red 's inability to render a convincing hurricane lead to a deluge of continuity and lighting error . Ultimately , the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effect than the intended storyline . Intermittent spate of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting . Charles Dance , doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass ' schtick , doe his best to save the movie . But ultimately , Undertow squeal like a pig ... and ha more ham to boot .",0
"Mickey Rourke ( who wa once a famous movie star ) play Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blow up a school bus full of child who is so disgusted by his action decides to leave the IRA and go on the run in London ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The movie 's opening is rather disturbing a the life of little child are ended in a fireball . Things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in Northern Ireland which give A PRAYER FOR THE DYING a stark realism . However a soon a Fallon decides he 's going to give up violence ( What ? He 's a terrorist and he 's never blown up innocent passerby before ? ) realism disappears and clichés and ridiculous plot twist take place . Martin is employed by the London underworld ( Do n't they have their own hit men ? ) to commit a hit while he wear an IRA `` uniform `` ( Never knew the provo wore uniform ) at a cemetery in broad daylight ( Would n't an IRA man use a bomb placed under a car ? ) where he 's spotted by a priest who recognises him while he wa in the SAS . Hands up who think I 'm lying ? I 'm not and we 're half way through the running time and there 's still several clichés to come This all sound very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by Jack Higgins ? Everything is clichéd , contrived and stereotypical and the bit that are n't are just plain bizarre . The critic slaughtered this movie when it came out , most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had Bob Hoskins playing gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates playing the SAS soldier turned priest and for once the critic would have been right . They should also noted the film might have been le dire if Fallon wa played by someone who wa capable of doing an Irish accent . Rourke might be hunky and macho ( Oh gawd another movie with an IRA uberhunk ) but accent are n't his strong point any more than character acting is . To give you an idea how disappointing PRAYER FOR THE DYING IS the director ended up disowning it which is always a bad sign As a footnote the original release of PRAYER FOR THE DYING in Britain wa delayed for several month because of `` The Enniskillen bombing `` . In November 1987 the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb in the centre of Enniskillen where a Remembrance Day parade which commemorates Britain 's war dead wa being held . Eleven ( 11 ) people were killed and score more injured . It wa n't an accident and no one left the IRA because of it",0
"In the literal sense .... Reminds you of those `` cops-and-robber '' or cowboys-indians '' role-playing game you played with your 8 year old friend . Tedious and un-inspired , the storyline wa obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem a part of the plot , but all it doe is showcase it . I cant believe John Badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap . This could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting , filmstock and editing Destined to be a time-filler on Sci-fi channel , when they 've overused everything else from their library , and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream .",0
"1 . Aliens resemble plush toy and hand puppet , while having arm that do n't function . 2 .

Old Security Guards know how to get a hold of C4 , and are just waiting for the right time to use it , say , when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason . 4 .

US Army Staff Sargeants apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about alien in the area . 13 . Aliens apparently always `` go home '' , which mean back to the vault they were un-locked in . 14 .

However , I 've seen far worse , and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold , intentional or otherwise . 2/10 - Jaws 4 wa worse then this . At least the film never took itself seriously .",0
"I would give this movie high mark for the cinema-photography and performance . I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who play a conniving courtesan who fleece Sinuoeh , the lead character . I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it . Apparently , she wa a Holocaust refugee , discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty . She died very young and under tragic circumstance . Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film . Like other neo-Biblical film of the 1940 's and 50 , `` The Egyptian '' reflects the moral and value of that time , but is still great entertainment because the performance are terrific and the story so well told .",1
"One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far : The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy . As nothing happens , the void is filled with long , boring dialog that do n't make any sense ! The cast is famous but doe n't bring any emotion except to fast-forward the play ! And it happens in a plush seaside hotel that look really gloomy . In comparison , the one of the `` Shining '' is funfair ! NB : a lot of user think that it is located in the French Riviera !

Although the society in di moon wa quite interesting . i would n't really recommend his to anyone , avoid if possible . if you found this comment hard to follow , the movie would be equally a bad .",0
"The folk at Aardman have done a cool , cute and wild adaptation of their short film of Wallace and Gromit to feature length , a the man and his dog , inventor who seem to have more of the intelligence ( or practicality ) for the latter . In this case they 've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunny that are eating up the crop all over a quiet English village . In particular for Mrs. Tottington ( or 'Totty ' for those who are 'intimate ' ) , much to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine , who just want to kill all the rabbit with his trust rifle . Wallace and Gromit seem to have success with their machine , but Wallace ha a mix-up : a machine he 's made to make more food suddenly criss-crosses himself with a rabbit - the curse is on ! A lot of this is about a much light-hearted fun that a kid 's movie could ask for , but it also tip it hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick : Looney Tunes , which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville . Granted , the Aardman guy ( Nick Park and Steve Box ) have a bunch more gimmick and trick and ingenuity with their material . It 's never le than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use , even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny `` ho-ho '' not funny `` ha-ha '' side ( a tired criticism but I 'll say it ) . Curse of the Were-Rabbit work so well on all front for the audience , in it warped story and sudden dip into exposition ( the Golden Bullet story is a doozy ) , Park and Box and company never lose sight of glee in the material . It 's fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely off-the-wall for the kid ( even the very youngest will love the adventure and strange gadget , such a the truck Wallace and Gromit drive around in ) , and for adult there 's little barb of funky , absurdist tone in the midst of a classic English farce . Only ( and I 'm probably a minority opinion here ) when compared to Chicken Run it 's almost a little slight a work- there 's le any plot than there is a series of running gag , and of course lot of pun involving bunny and monster and carnival and cheese ( and horrible men with ego in their gun like the Fiennes voiced Quartermaine ) . But when it strike best , it 's one of the most entertaining film of 2005 . It give me a big goofy smile anytime it 's on TV .",1
"Another weak third-season entry , 'Is There In Truth No Beauty ? ' nonetheless ha at least one key plot element that is very different and a Spock would say , fascinating . The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drive human insane . It 's too bad the episode can not live up to this incredible premise . Obviously , I think , it wa a mistake to ever 'show ' the alien , a it actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up ; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of thing in different episode , usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar . In any event , Kollos ' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock , and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor . ( For the longest time , I thought the alien 's name wa 'Carlos , ' which I found humorous , but I digress . ) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety . This is accomplished , but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld , by golly , Spock forgets his visor . Uh oh . He go crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos ' assistant , a blind woman with psychic power . This might have been a really bizarre , excellent episode but it is poorly directed and come across a yet one more badly executed show of the series ' last season .",0
"This movie is trash-poor . It ha horrible taste , and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real-events - which doe n't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment . Direction is not well done at a scene and dialogue are out-of-place . Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story . To start , Williams is not convincing a a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting . What 's worse , his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and ha no place a a plot device . You have an older Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting `` d_ck_smker '' - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the Williams character . Finally you have Sandra Oh a a guardian angel adviser to Williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end . Toni Collete 's character is just plain annoying and a re-hash of her 6th Sense performance with poorer direction . Very Miss-able .",0
"This movie `` Vampires : The Turning '' is n't even really worth the 2 out of 10 I 'm giving it . The movie , is very predictable from beginning , up to the very end when our hero kill the leader of the Vampire Slayers . The use of music in this movie wa even bad , it kept playing a if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second , though it never did . The acting , wa B-Rank at best ... And the movie wa just , dull . The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story , had potential though it ended up unable to deliver . Oh , and did I mention the wardrobe ? The wardrobe for this movie wa obviously cheap to `` non-existent '' because our hero , and his girlfriend ( whom he 's trying to save throughout the entire movie ) wear the same outfit through the entire movie . I 'd suggest this film only if your really bored , and do n't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry . ~Dave , the Horror Cowboy",0
"A new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co-worker to steal 42 million from the truck . No bad guy , so no one will get hurt , right ? Of course thing go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make thing right by saving the life of a dying man . I 'll admit that I did n't really have any interest in this film , but I did n't have any interest in Fantastic Mr Fox either , and that film made my top ten of the year . Armored is even more of a disappointment then I thought it would be . As a heist film , it fails to deliver the good , it 's boring and full of plot hole and leap in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it . Despite this the film somehow ha a really great cast , but the film doe n't even use this to it 's advantage . Everyone seems wasted in wooden character that make stupid choice . Columbus Short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never make the audience want to give a crap . Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he play Mr. Nice Guy at first , then when thing do n't go his way he quickly becomes the villain . The rest of the impressive cast include Lawrence Fisburn , Jean Reno , Skeet Ulrich , Fred Ward , Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros . Non of them do much and when they actually do something , it 's without much reasoning behind it . The film is relatively short , but even with it 's running time under 90 minute , it felt dragged out . How long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere ? Phonebooth did a decent job and it wa even more restricted . The leap of logic concerning the plot here are tragic . 42 million and all the security they have are check in every hour or so ? The entire plan from my understanding wa to drive the truck into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money . Pretend to get hit and burn the truck . They would then walk away with the money . Of course something go wrong , or there would be no movie right ? Through a series of unfortunate event out so called hero ha trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer . The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew banging on the door to get in . How very exciting . The script call for our hero to have financial problem , he might lose his house , which would in turn make him lose his brother . You see , both their parent died and it 's just the two of them looking out for each other . So now he ha a reason to join the heist . At first he did n't want in , but his money problem is just the right push to throw him in the thick of thing . How convenient . Armored 's whole spin on the heist genre is that it 's from an armored truck , from the guy who drive it . After that basic premise , the film fall flat on it 's face . I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke . Speaking of the ending , it suck . Skip it .",0
"For a really wonderful movie , you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for any audience . Best thing I liked about this movie wa the Mexico landscape , & it get the movie up to a 2 . I wa surprised that these actor did n't have terrible sunburn , they were so were not desert dweller . And Moses is said to have a speakING impediment , but certainly not here . Even the `` miracle '' scene were contrived & un-believable . And what 's the point if you can belief anything in a TV story ? Talk about dumbing down , I thought this Hallmark-made movie wa pathetic , & I can see why others hate Hollywood . I do n't , just some of these corporate profit grubbers . You do n't have to be any kind of religious to benefit from `` Jesus of Nazareth '' , but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored , with nothing to do , dumbed-down & religious . And for a real movie experience , try `` Short Cut to Nirvana '' , a very highly rated film .",0

"This show wa not only great human drama but portrayed racism in this country in a raw , all too true to life manner . When one show can be so witty and entertaining and yet so poignant and educational all at once , this is television in it highest form . The acting wa phenomenal . The writing wa exceptional . Not only did the show portray race relation in a straightforward manner that seems unmatched by any other television series , but it ability to depict this subject matter a it existed in the 1960 's alongside how it exists in the beginning of the twenty-first century powerfully demonstrates the way we have changed , and sadly , the many more way we have not .",1
"A young couple -- father Ben ( solid Charles Bateman ) , wife Nicky ( the lovely Ahna Capri ) and their daughter KT ( the cute Geri Reischl of `` I Dismember Mama '' fame ) -- find themselves trapped in a small California desert town populated by hysterical lunatic . Worse yet , there 's a pernicious Satanic cult that 's been abducting little child for their own diabolical purpose . Director Bernard McEveety , working from an offbeat and inspired script by William Welch and L.Q . Jones ( `` Devil Times Five '' director Sean MacGregor came up with the bizarre story ) , relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow , yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy , edgy , mysterious ooga-booga atmosphere . Strother Martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance a Doc Duncan , who 's the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect . The top-rate cast of excellent character actor qualifies a a substantial asset : Jones a gruff , no-nonsense Sheriff Hillsboro , Alvy Moore a friendly local Toby , and Charles Robinson a a shrewd , fiercely devout priest Jack . John Arthur Morrill 's bright , polished widescreen cinematography , Jamie Mendoza-Nava 's spooky score , and the wild , rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed . The idea of having toy come to murderous life is simply ingenious ( the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting ) . Nice eerily ambiguous ending , too . A pleasingly idiosyncratic and under-appreciated winner .",1
"Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash , and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in English class . This is literally one of the worst film I have ever seen . It totally ignores and contradicts any theme it may present , so the story is just really really dull . Thank god the 80 's are over , and god save whatever man wa actually born a `` James Bond III '' .",0
"If you 're a T-Rex/Marc Bolan fan , I recommend you check this out . It show a whimsical side of Marc Bolan a well a Ringo Starr , apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scene that are n't part of the concert , but fun to watch , leaving you with a sense of getting to know them a just people , and when the concert is shown a talented musician , both playful and professional that rock and seems to impress the screaming girl . Watching him in concert , you would never know that being a rock star is a job , but just having a great time playing some great song with some good friend , like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performance . True , there are a few song missing that I would like to have seen on there , but like any album it ca n't have everything . I just bought this in 2006 , but if I would have know it came out in 1972 , I would have definitely bought it year ago . Sad and strange that a man with so many song about his love for car , would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash !",1
"I wa at the same screenwriter conference and saw the movie . I thought the writer - Sue Smith - very clearly summarised what the film wa about . However , the movie really did n't need explanation . I thought the theme were abundantly clear , and inspiring . A movie which deal with the the ability to dare , to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figure - and overcome it and , in doing so , embrace life 's possibility , is a film to be treasured and savoured . I enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped 'Somersault . ' I also think Mandy62 wa a bit unkind to Hugo Weaving . As a bloke about his vintage , I should look so good ! I agree that many Australian film have been lacklustre recently , but 'Peaches ' delivers the good . I 'm glad I saw it .",1
"From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'Cruel Intentions ' , and how flat it landed . You 'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne a Valmont ... Then in the second scene , you meet the two best thing in this movie , Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers a Kathryn and her mother . That is , if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wa n't blonde in the first film ... Then the movie go on , you see the cheap romantic story from mile ago , and you notice Sebastian ha already met an Anette in the past , here called Danielle , and a Cecile , here called Cherie ... How original is that for a prequel . Then it turn into a low budget 'Wild Things ' type of film with lot and lot of oh-my `` twist '' . As I mentioned , Robin Dunne wa a very bad choice . Not that he is a bad actor , he 's good .. He just doe n't have the charisma Ryan did . Amy Adams , who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actress of our time , once again delivers . But with all the talent in the world , there is no way one could save this trash . As a whole , this `` movie '' feel like a 'Beverly Hills , 90210 ' episode . The score ha been stolen from 'Cruel Intentions ' and 'Jawbreaker ' ... Yes , they used the score from JAWBREAKER ... Could n't they at least leave that one alone ? ! You 'll want to pas this one . If you want more Cruel Intentions , watch Stephen Frears ' Dangerous Liaisons .",0
"`` The Chipmunk Adventure '' is one of the greatest animated movie of the 1980 's . Alvin and the Chipmunks have always been of some interest to me , since they were what really got me into rock and roll . Neither one of the Chipmunks ha any bad trait . Alvin 's really the star and ha all the cool look . Theodore is the lovable sensitive one . Then there 's Simon ( my personal favorite ) , the smart one who is often a party pooper . I also like the Chipettes a lot . There 's Brittany , who , like Alvin , is one who is always trying to be so popular . Then there 's Eleanor , who , like Theodore , is sweet , sensitive , and love food . Janette is the only Chipette who is not much like her counterpart ; she 's very naive and really clumsy . In the Chipmunks ' very first full-length movie , David Seville is going on a business trip to Europe , and he 's leaving the boy with Miss Miller while he 's gone . While playing an arcade game , Alvin loses against Brittany and then say that if he had the money , he 'd race Brittany around the world for real . Unbeknownest to the kid , a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister , Claudia , who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamond around the world in exchange for cash , overheard this conversation and said that they 'd let them race around the world for $ 100,000 . Alvin and Brittany accept it and go on the race . This adventurous movie ha a lot of great song . `` Off to See the World '' made for an appropriate theme song for the movie . Then there is `` Getting Lucky '' , one of my favorite song in the movie . `` My Mother '' is most likely the sappiest song in the movie , but it always make me cry . `` Wooly Bully '' is the only cover song used in the movie ( the rest were completely original ) . Then , of course , there 's `` The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll '' , which , in my opinion , ha to be one of the greatest musical number in movie history . I used to watch this movie very often , until my recorded tape of it died . I still watch the movie , though . This is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time . It 'll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you 'd expect out of world travel . Definitely one of my childhood movie , and one that I 'd recommend to 80 's fan and Alvin & the Chipmunks fan .",1
"If you can watch a Bond film from 1983 that is n't a good a Octopussy and still enjoy it . If you can accept production value which are n't that much above the level of a TV movie .

If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score , not up there with Barry on his worst day . If you do n't believe the hyperbolic review that it wa greeted with on release . If you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same . Yours is Never Say Never Again and everything that 's in it .

"This wa allocated to the fan a the `` winner take all '' match occurred between two separate `` company '' ( the World Wrestling Federation and the `` Alliance '' : an amalgamation of former WCW and ECW superstar . Because the final match to duduce the superior company wa a tag-team match , the wrestler were confined to tossing opponent from each side of the ring to another ; each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponent and to intensify the match , interfernce is necessary . Each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punch , executes a special move , and tag in a partner . The storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of Vince that a member of the Allance would be fradulent and join the WWF . It wa obvious , with that statement , that the WWF would prevail . Overall : very innovative storyline but poor execution , which is not the scarcity of the wrestler because the match format is tag-team . The remaining match are just revolting : Edge versus Test : potent `` big boot '' by Test , but this did not display the true talent of both star Al Snow Versus Christian : good match but superflous to the pay-per-view Taji versus William Regal : the worst match of the night Immunity Battle Royal : This wa an outstandingly fun match to watch , but because the main star of both company were involved in the main event , only a wrestler who characteristically appears on `` Heat '' and is probably a WCW light-heavyweight reject ( i.e . the Hurricane who is merely hired a an entertainer ) Hardy Boyz Versus Dudley Boyz : The best match of the night : Jeff Hardy executed a `` Swanton Bomb '' from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and Matt wa wedged into the cage , which appeared to be extremely painful . Because Stone Cold wa the WWF champion , Rob Van Dam wa the Hardcore Champion , and Kurt Angle wa a `` mole '' in the alliance , all fundamental star in the main event on the faction of `` the Alliance '' were granted work after the match 's outcome , except for Booker T. , who recently attacked a wrestler on `` Raw '' and will inevitably be given work . Shane McMahon will return to television somehow , and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of `` the Alliance '' to see Stone Cold out of work . The WWF ha done much better . A match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better , and what ever became of Casket and Iron Man match ?",0
"This movie offer NOTHING to anyone . It doe n't succeed on ANY level . The acting is horrible , dull long-winded dribble . They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film wa aiming for . Complete garbage , I ca n't believe what a laughable movie this wa . And I 'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit , a wowing NC-17 movie . The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film a the film play out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teen . Pathetic .",0
"Che : Part One wa a fascinating experiment , which did not only tell a very interesting story , but it also tried to do something different with the `` biopic '' genre.Che : Part Two is the excellent culmination of this experiment . This movie offer all of the same attribute from the first one , from the extraordinary performance ( specially from Benicio del Toro ) to Steven Soderbergh 's brilliant direction , without forgetting it intention of breaking with the conventional rule from the biopics.That is what I admire from Soderbergh 's experiment ... they always try to do something different and unusual , and they succeed most of the time . The final message from this film is perfect , and it includes everything we have been told about Che Guervara 's life.The only fail I found on Che : Part Two is that a few part felt a bit irrelevant . In summary , I give Che : Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation because , a the first one , it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenge the spectator and leaf u thinking .",1
"As much a I dislike saying 'me too ' in response to other comment - it 's completely true that the first 30 minute of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90 . Having been banned somewhere doe n't make a film watchable . Just because it doe n't resemble a Hollywood product doe not make it credible . Worse yet , in addition to no discernible plot ( other than there are lot of muddy place in Russia and many people , even very old woman , drink lot of vodka ) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating I 'm in to my second package of Rolaids . As for spoiler - well , the film is so devoid of any narrative thread I could n't write one if I tried . Do n't waste your time or money , and do n't confuse this with good Russian cinema .",0
"Before seeing this , I wa merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated `` Emmanuelle '' series starring Sylvia Kristel . It wa really surprising how good this one turned out to be . It actually ha a story , and it is very romantic indeed . What make 'Yellow Emanuelle ' so good is it 's leading heroine , the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee . She play her character , Emy Wong so sweetly , that the viewer just ha to feel something for her when her dream crash down around her . Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor , statuesque , with a regal quality . She come from an important old family , where ancient custom are still practiced . Emy will remain a virgin until she is married , to a man she ha never met . The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage . It is simply how it is done in her world . However she doe not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who end up under her care in the hospital where she work . Emy decides to do away with custom , and she give herself to her Western man . But only after a very long courtship , a Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman . Her pilot , George , is a good guy , and promise to marry Emy , so that she doe n't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society . Neither one count on a third party , one Ilona Staller , who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious game . Emy is made to believe that she ha been abandoned by her man , that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her . Her place in society is gone , she ha been debased . The film take a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn a this proud , elegant woman give up her career , a well a a sweet relationship with her caring father , and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution . I wa surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale . I wa on the edge of my seat when George blow back into town , and unknowingly walk into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working a a prostitute ! Classic drama . I imagine many viewer were a bit frustrated by all this drama . One would expect lot of sex and nudity here , but there is not much . And when there is , it is totally non-exploitative , and very artsy and soft-core . If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle , with Sylvia Kristel , than you most likely will appreciate this , lesser known classic . I wa especially impressed by the extra attention to detail . The whole segment where Emy take George to her father house on the island is really nice . Her father show George , and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai tree . He ha a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing tree . Totally unexpected . After catching it on late night cable TV year ago , I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film . When i finally got it i found that the video version wa longer . More sex ? No , more melodrama . For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease ! I actually preferred the cable version better . I am glad that this rare gem ha been released finally on DVD . I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70 's soundtrack . While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare , and quite special . I recommend it to thoughtful viewer who do n't need sex and violence to maintain their interest .",1
"Wonderful romance comedy drama about an Italian widow ( Cher ) who 's planning to marry a man she 's comfortable with ( Danny Aiello ) until she fall for his headstrong , angry brother ( Nicholas Cage ) . The script is sharp with plenty of great line , the acting is wonderful , the accent ( I 've been told ) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful . New York ha never looked so good on the screen . A must-see primarily for Cher and Olympia Dukakis -- they 're both fantastic and richly deserved the Oscars they got . A beautiful , funny film . A must see !",1
"* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * Released in 1956 , and considered quite racy at the time , Douglas Sirk 's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing . The plot concern the going on in an oil rich dysfunctional Texas family that includes big brother Kyle , who is insecure , weak , wounded & very alcoholic , played by Robert Stack in a very touching & vulneable performance and his sluty sister Marylee played in an extreme manner by Dorothy Malone . Ms. Malone 's performance is telegraphed to u via her eye , which she us to show u her emotion , which mostly consist of lust ( for Rock Hudson ) and jealousy ( for Lauren Bacall ) . Malone is the only actress I 've ever seen in movie who enters a room eye first . Now do n't get me wrong , her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot , and is one of the supreme camp acting job of the 1950 's . But it is also terrible , because a likeable and attractive a Malone is , she 's not a very good actress , and she 's not capable of subtly or shading . Her performace is of one note . She doe get to do a wicked Mambo , and in a great montage , a unloving daddy played by the always good Robert Keith fall to his death climbing a staircase , Sirk mix it up with an almost mad Malone doing a orgasmic dance a she undress . Stack , ( who should have won an Oscar ) & Malone , ( who won the award , but should n't have ) are the real star of the film , the one who set all the hysteria , both sexual & otherwise in motion , while the `` real star '' of the film , Hudson & Bacall fade to grey & brown , which are the color that they are mainly costumed in . Hudson who wa a better actor then given credit for play the childhood & best friend of Stack 's , and the stalked love interest of Malone 's who moan & groan over Rock through most of the film . But Hudson want no part of her , and instead is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack . No one is very happy & no one is happy for very long . The Stack-Bacall marriage fall apart big time after a year , and Stack pretty much drink himself into oblivion because he think he is sterile , and ca n't give Bacall a baby to prove that he 's a man . Sirk who wa a very intelligent man , and had a long & fascinating career both in film and theatre in Germany , ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid 1950 's with a series of intense vividly colored `` woman 's movie '' or melodrama . Although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material , in Sirk 's hand they became masterpiece of the genre . Sirk had a wonderful sense of color & design which he brought to play in these film filling his wide screen space with character who played out their emotional life among weird color combination & lighting , make believe shadow , and lot of mirroed reflection . In `` Written '' the character are always peeking out of window , listening at door or sneaking around . So in the end , after much violence , an accidental murder , a miscarriage & more Sirk end the movie with a final & startling scene of a `` reborn '' and reformed Malone in a man-tailored suit , sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell .",1

"[ I saw this movie once late on a public tv station , so I do n't know if it 's on video or not . ] This is one of the `` Baby Burlesks '' ( sic ) that Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s . It is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little film which today might just be considered this side of `` kiddie porn '' . Shirley Temple star in a cast which probably ha an average age of 5 . They are all in diaper , and are in a saloon which serf milk instead of alcohol . The `` cash '' is in the form of lollipop . Shirley playing a `` femme fatale '' sashay up to the bar and talk to soldier who make suggestive comment about her ( ! ) . But Shirley doe n't need really their lollipops/cash because her purse is full of one from other `` men '' . Meanwhile a little black boy doe a suggestive dance on a nearby table ( ! ) .

"Duck_of_Death need to watch this film again , a his major criticism is completely baseless . The film never once forgot about the time delay , and it wa mentioned explicitly in a couple of place . The crew were never shown having conversation with mission control that did n't obey the time delay rule . One thing I did think wa a bit far-fetched wa the amount of risk involved - would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suit would only last two hour ? I doubt it . Would a manned space ship go into a star 's corona ? I doubt it . Would human land on a moon that wa being bombarded with huge amount of radiation ? I doubt it . Also , the ship seemed overly sturdy . Would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down ? I doubt it . Would it survive being hit by comet debris ? I doubt it . I think in both case the stress on the structure would be too much . But all-in-all , the unlikely scenario were compensated by some nicely done special effect , good editing and production , and some good acting , especially by the actor portraying the ship 's commander and the Russian cosmonaut .",1
"I do n't remember this film getting a cinema release over here . I only saw it when it came onto cable . The film deal with the dehumanisation of child into killing machine . Specifically one person , the way he get replaced and dumped ( literally ) into an off-world community where he find himself unable to cope with coming to term with who he really is and what he feel . Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space , and would have been happy if it wa . I 'm certainly happy it was'nt - Kurt doe a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple . The scene where he 's sitting outside the compound show this , albeit the decision for two slow-mo replay detracts from the moment . This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner , Alien , Silent running , Logan 's run or THX1138 were , however it is unfortunately the nearest I 've seen to it in a long time . He change in the movie to a believable degree , he does'nt crack Arnie one liner , he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending . That 's why this film did'nt do well . It did'nt follow formula , and among a 18-25 year old target American audience , that 's unforgivable a it wa was'nt what they expected to see . Fear and discipline . Always .",1
"However , the lady of all age will lap it up , no doubt ; at least the opposite sex understand what it is to be a mother , and most of u men try to fathom out what it is to be a father .

Some good interpretation here , and a good story idea ; the handling of the matter , limited to rather scanty TV-production concept , give the film a rather over-mellowy taste with not much new to offer . An insipid way of delivering the good , and in the end the outcome is so forseeable during the last 20 minute or so , even my wife dozed off , and I wa jumping up to the computer to get the on-line scoring in the Barcelona-Deportivo match , hoping the away team would do something rather good .

"A very hyped-up , slick , edgy reinterpretation . They 've fallen into the `` because it 's modern , it ha to be hyped-up , slick , etc .

Just because this is a `` modern '' retelling , doe n't mean the movie ha to look like a magazine ad , or have anything to do with drug or gun . If the trapping were a subtle a the honeyed word , Macbeth would be a far more powerful film . As it is , read your Shakespeare . Read it out loud . Ask your Oxford dictionary some question . Skip the film . Or do n't , but you 've been warned . Sorry for the super-long review . IMDb made me do it .",0
"I had heard interesting critic on this movie . I believed it wa a love story but I wa n't sure what wa the plot about . So , when I finally saw it , I found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex-con Isabel ( Isabel Ampudia ) and the junkie Rufo ( Sebastián Haro ) . So , a love story but not probably what I wa expecting . The movie is focused on Isabel , a she struggle to get back into society . She doe n't want to return back to her neighborhood and she find herself without a home or anywhere to go . So , while she just experience those first hour of freedom after being released from jail she came across Rufo , an old acquittance of her which while she wa in had become a junkie and life on the street . Not having where to go , and without money or feasible source of income , she decides to join Rufo on his residence : a covered area on a lonely street . The story by itself is moving . It explains how the , impossible , relationship between Isabel and Rufo get deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie . Definitely , the movie is worth watching . Sebastián Haro is splendid in his role of the junkie . A person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street scum . Just depending whom deal him with . I believe his role . On the other hand , I do n't quite believe the role of Isabel Ampudia . Although the movie try to show the bitterness inside her through several scene , she is not capable to make me believe it . She is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation . The movie try to show a love on a desperate situation . It is a enjoyable movie . But the feeling I get when the movie end is that Isabel , with the way of thinking and acting she ha , would never have arrived to that situation . Her role , partly because of the script , partly because of the acting is difficult to believe . I specially like the ending , and because of it I have raised my rating one or two point . I liked it bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes , survival instinct is above other more spiritual consideration a love . Summarizing , an interesting movie , but it lacked some punch to be a total `` must see '' .",1
"I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what wa touted a an award-winning Brit sex comedy . I guess I should have read the finer print . I rarely write a panning review , but here go . These actor in gay role really play game with your memory of a lot of far more worthy film . This comedy wa a very cruel joke at the expense of the actor , the theatre-going public and of all the nice film that have contributed to their reputation . I repeat : is the joke about trashing the actor ' other highly respectable on-screen persona with this scurrilously trashy flick ? Can the reference to the Austen classic 'Pride and Prejudice ' and 'Sense and Sensibility ' be anything else ? How much of a political statement wa it to produce this melodrama using these star ? Are we meant to simply take it a a lay-down misere that all actor are gay and thus letting their on-screen roleplay affect our lifestyle is accepting their private homosexual dealing in our face , too ? I 'm sorry , but I do n't think so . I say NO to this one .",0
"First of all , nothing will ever compare to the original movie , but for gosh sake , they 're not trying to . It is just one person opinion about what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara . I for one thought it wa a terrific movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection . The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie . Just view this movie a an extension of the original and do n't think they are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you will enjoy it a lot . They really captured the spoiled selfishness of Scarlett in many of the scene and you can see from the longing in the look from Rhett that he is clearly still in love with Scarlett . The fact that you can recognize many of the actor in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on TV . I always wanted them to have other child after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly . Lore60",1
"I do n't hand out ten star rating easily . A movie really ha to impress me , and The Bourne Ultimatum ha gone far beyond that . Furthermore , this trilogy ha come together so nicely , that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogy of our time . Though all three film could not be any more different from the Ludlum novel , they still stand a a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement . The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series wa complete , yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hour . From the moment that the opening title appeared , I knew we were in for a ride . Paul Greengrass ha done it again . Everything we love from the previous Bourne film is here once again : the action , the dialogue , and of course the shaky camera . However for me , that last one wa never a problem . I think it add to the suspense . I will be back to see this film several time before it is released on DVD , simply because it is genius . It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion , and should stand the test of time a a fantastic movie , and altogether , an unforgettable trilogy .",1
"Seriously , I don´t really get why people here are bashing it . I mean , the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd . The good news is , the producer realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of Army of Darkness . Especially in the second half of the film , when the little killer snowball attack , I laughed my as off . For example , the put one of the little creep into a blender ( a la Gremlins 1 ) and mix it . After that , it morphs back into a snowball and squeal with a high pitched voice `` That wa fun ! '' . Bottom line - incredible movie , rent it .",1
"It 's been a while since I 've watched this movie , and the series , but now I 'm refreshing my memory ! This wa a very funny movie based on the classic series ! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together . Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee . When Boss Hogg force the Dukes off their farm , Bo and Luke sneak around Hogg 's local construction site and find sample of coal . They soon realize that Boss Hogg is gon na strip-mine Hazzard County , unless the Dukes can stop him , with the help of their beautiful cousin , Daisy . My only two problem with the movie wa that Burt Reynolds wa n't right for the part of Boss Hogg , and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane wa way too serious . Other than that , I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD ! ! !",1
"I had never heard of this movie , but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounded interesting , so I figured I 'd give it a shot . I found it to be very enjoyable . Heath Ledger play a 19 year old who work a kind of crappy job and want to start making some serious dough , so he go and asks for work from mobster Bryan Brown . I wo n't go into detail but thing go very bad for Ledger and get into big trouble with Bryan Brown . From their on the movie just get better and better , with one scene involving Ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robber . And let not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne , who play Ledger 's love interest . I would definitely recommend this movie .",1
"Teamo Supremo are three kid , consisting of their leader- Captain Crandall , Rope Girl and Skate Lad , all with their own battlecry ( buza ! chika ! woopa ! ) and outfit and move . They work for the governor , Kevin , and were recruited after wishing to be hero and playing at that game . They lead normal life a well , and have family and school duty , but most of the action take place away from school fighting villain . The villain all have rather unique and singular trait , such a Mister Vague and his men who never seem to know what their plan are but act anyway . From an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil , and often strange , plan to gain power , take revenge etc . The animation itself is quite nice and smooth , but the style appears to be simple on purpose . The background have overlapping colour and the building seem futuristic . The music is quite nice , and the show is n't too bad altogether , although the style is n't my favourite . The plot are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous , but after all this is a cartoon and one ca n't blame them for that . However this would not be in the same rank a Fillmore ! or Pepper Ann .",0
"I can not believe how popular this show is . I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan . I have read countless sci-fi novel and have enjoyed many sci-fi movie and TV show . I really would n't even consider this true sci-fi . Every episode I have sat through wa like a lame , watered down version of a Star Trek episode , minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting . It 's basically a bunch of people standing around in ARMY fatigue , talking about something boring , who occasionally go through the Stargate and end up on a planet that look just like Earth , with people who look and sound just like Humans ! It seemed extremely low budget . The character are all forgettable one dimensional cutout , and the many attempt at humor fall flat . It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it , trying to be funny , but he is not . It is just sad . The movie wa terrible a well . There is so much you can do with a portal through space , yet every place the ARMY people go is BORING ! This show no imagination ! I actually thought the TV series `` Alien Nation '' from a few year back ( based on the movie Alien Nation ) wa much better . That show actually had good story line and decent character . I wa n't crazy about `` Alien Nation '' , but compared to this overrated crap , it wa great ! Also , unlike the great new `` Battlestar Galactica '' series , `` Stargate '' copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely ! They should have at least updated the cheesy `` toilet flushing '' special effect of whenever somebody go through the Stargate .",0
"After 10 viewing in 20 year I too think this wa the Crazy Gang 's best effort on film , with more cohesion in the plot than their next best , `` Alf 's Button Afloat '' . They were indeed a crazy trio of double act thrown together mainly on stage , sometimes in front of royalty , until Chesney Allen retired in the '40 's through `` ill-health '' . He outlived them all by year . Apparently they were just a mad outside `` work '' , regularly playing practical joke on one another . The Six Wonder Boys troupe head for I'll-Get-Her-To-Tell-Me ( Alaska ) to dig for the gold that wa being found there . It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they 'd been there . When they get to Red Gulch they find their information wa a mere 40 year out of date - they thought that the chip that were in the guilty newspaper they 'd read tasted funny . But by then it doe n't matter a they 've all fallen in love with Snow White and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold . Baddie Bill `` M '' McGrew want it himself however . The number of verbal and visual pun is astonishing , but most of them will probably only make sense ( ? ) to Brits and ex-pats interested in seeing '30 's British b & w comedy . Imho nearly all of the gag and routine work , including the Gold If patter between Bud & Chesney and the `` Whistle While You Work '' pastiche - even the `` Always Getting Our Man '' Mountie insert . A marvellous little film , in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended .",1
"If like me , you enjoyed the first film `` Bruce Almighty '' , my advice to you is not to get your hope up too high ; in fact disregard any hope you posse for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film-sense at all . Without giving too much away , the story see Evan ( Bruce 's nemesis co-anchor from the first film ) move home with his family to the Virginian suburb to `` Change the World '' with a new political path . What follows is a rather far-fetched and quite 'silly ' storyline , which is obviously set out to target young child a the main target audience . Unlike it 's predecessor , Evan Almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of 'comedy ' tagged upon it 's misleading position of 'sequel ' to which some would regard a modern-day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature , upscale audience . Generally speaking , Evan Almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic value . The acting ; omit Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman , wa rigid and many of the character were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production . Additionally , the cast includes acting legend John Goodman who make an appearance a a heel and is seen just a few time in the movie 's entirety ; I did n't quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he wa involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy . Every other character in the movie ( especially the wife and kid ! ) deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king-size Kiev . Be warned though ; it is the typical Americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-orientated film , so I 'd advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight . It may seem the movie is worthless thus-far , however , it doe have -some- promising aspect . The CGI wa outstanding and it wa clear that a lot of time went into modelling the Ark and producing water effect and animation of the computer generated animal towards the end . The particle , render and texture used were aesthetically stellar . Although part of me could n't help , but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideal and were , in my opinion , 'too good ' for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout . Overall I view this film a a disaster in term of continuing what wa a franchise with huge potential , but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the Almighty series and approaching the end of the film I had set my expectation high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content I had so far witnessed . This wa n't the case and I wa deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credit . As I sat discontent I could n't help , but think the movie wa n't anywhere near a 'Mighty ' a I hoped for . In many way the film reminded me of a watered down `` Night at the Museum '' a it showed similar styling and characteristic , but unfortunately wa league below even that . I give this movie 3 out of 10 , a it is watchable , but it 's definitely one to be avoided ! If you HAVE to see this film , be prepared for disappointment a 'mildly entertained ' is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production .",0
"This movie is painfully slow and ha no plot . It conveys the life of a group of laid off boatworkers . One of the older one is sincere in his attempt to get a job . There may be some social commentary here , but , it is muddled a nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light . I do not understand why it had a 7.8 when I decided to watch it . I watched the whole tedious thing and built expectation for a huge redeeming payoff . No luck . The IMDb rating ha always been such a good match for my taste . Anything above 6.5 wa worth watching . And my wife say Javier Barem doe not even look good in this movie . He 's not my type , so , my agreement doe not mean much . Sigh . I give it a 1 .",0
"My sibling and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970 's . We absolutely adored it . There wa something so exotic and mysterious about it , especially when compared to the usual American re-runs ( Petticoat Junction , Green Acres ... you get the idea ) . It had a similar feel to The Avengers ( not too much of a surprise , since it wa also British and in the spy/adventure genre ) . I would love to see it again now -- hopefully it hold up . I 've mentioned this show to others and no one ha ever heard of it , so I began to wonder if I 'd imagined it whole existence . But the wonder that is the web ha allowed me track down information about it . Hopefully it will find a new generation of fan .",1
"As a flying and war movie buff , this rank at he bottom of my list . It is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sound and act like they just stepped out of a high-school play . The acting , script , direction , production standard and casting are all garbage . The only saving grace is some of the flying sequence . If the people they portray were fictitious , I might rate it a 2 , but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movie , it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be , actually did this ! Its almost a if they tried to write in a many notable WW1 personality a possible.There are many good WW1 flying film and this is NOT one of them .",0
"The only part lacking in this movie is Shue 's part a the daughter wanting to follow in her `` aunt 's '' footstep a a daytime soap star . Otherwise it would be a perfect 10 . It seems that every actor enjoyed their part and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment a well a the script - I have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wa n't taking place in part . It wa well cast and there are some classic line that will stick with you . It 's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once . I 'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose . You 'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely , 'Nurse Nan ' ha a little secret she 'd rather not have shared with you . If you love daytime soap or despise them , this move poke fun in all the right place .",1
"This is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man . Phillipe Harel a Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver , Inspector Clouseau ( in his stoicism ) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There ( also Peter Sellers ) . He is single yet doe n't have a clue how to attract the opposite sex - in fact , he really make no effort at all ! He ha a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom - his friend Jose Garcia a Tisserand is in the same plight yet at least make a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood ( he 's 28 and admits he 's never had sex ) . Very good outdoor shot of Paris and Rouen , where the two software people travel on business . They try various nightclub and place but all to no avail . My theory is that they 're trying the wrong place - they go to more-or-less 'youth ' nightclub ; they should try the type that ha older people , more their own age . Harel increasingly becomes isolated and doe a little de Niro effort , a in Taxi Driver , urging his friend/colleague to go and stab some bloke who 's pulled a nice-looking girl in the nightclub . Worth watching .",1
"Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching . From that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is . It is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known . It 's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top DJs ( e.g . DJ Q-Bert , DJ Shadow , and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys ) showing off their stuff . Going into the film I wa n't sure that `` scratching '' can really be called an art form , or that the turntable can be viewed a an instrument in it own right . Scratch completely changed my mind on these point . What these guy do with their turntable is truly amazing -- it is definitely some kind of art -- and the turntable , if you know how to use it , can be transformed into an instrument that you can `` play , '' a much a a drum or a guitar . And you even get a lesson on the basic of scratching from DJ Q-Bert ( e.g . how to use the fader to get different sound effect ) . All these DJs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock perform his song `` Rock It '' ( you remember that song , do n't you ? ) live at the Grammys . What got their attention wa not Hancock himself but his DJ and his scratching . Not only is Scratch about scratching , but it doe some `` scratching '' of it own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited . There are moment where clip are quickly `` rewound '' and then `` forwarded '' several time , which mirror ( in the film medium ) what happens when a DJ quickly move the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader ( that `` wicka-wicka-wicka '' sound ) . Whether you 're a fan of hip hop or not , you can count on Scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movie . After seeing it , I had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own . And I mean this a a compliment .",1
"The dream of Karim Hussain are to be feared . When the right hemisphere of his character overpowers the left , shocking image of blood , dismemberment , and various abomination are released . Religion wo n't save you , nor will mother nature or your own family . Hussain 's dark poetry , because that 's what this film really is , destabalizes all institution of sanctuary . ` Subconcious Cruelty ' is a current crowd pleaser on the horror\fantasy festival circuit . The film 's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound . The protagonist 's desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic . From here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackle mother nature . Hussain offer depiction of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness . Nature is exposed a blood-drenched and violent in Hussain 's frightening enlightenment . ` Subconcious Cruelty ' is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature theme of life , lust and madness this very worthy film explores . CJ Goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up , a do David Kristian for unnerving sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for score .",1
"Fearful Symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few fault . The first thing about the episode is that it take place near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho . Season one 's 'Deep Throat ' take place near Ellens Air Base , also in southwest Idaho . I 'm wondering if the air force base are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry . Mulder and Scully have some good dialog , always a plus . Ed Meecham , the zoo keeper , reminds me of cranky , old school teacher . They must have liked child at one time , you just ca n't imagine how . Just like he must have cared more for animal at one point . I liked the concept of the episode , but I felt it had some inconsistency . If alien are so adept at abducting human and returning them safely , why ca n't they put the animal back in the right place ? And the alien are just now having problem returning the animal ? I do n't buy Mulder 's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum . As if he 's an expert on that . I also thought Jayne Atkinson 's performance a Willa Ambrose wa not well done . Besides those nitpicks , I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of alien harvesting animal DNA a well a human DNA .",1
"This is without a doubt one of the worst movie EVER , I emphasize , EVER made . What´s worse , my old hero Dolph is in it and he´s starring it . Jesus ... The story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt . The fighting scene for starter are about a well choreographed a a fight between two drunk slugging it out in the gutter . The actor , except for Dolph who kinda suck also , perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friend of the director , who by the way must have been absent most , if not all , of the time . This is §12 million spent in an unimaginable way , because by the look of the effect and scenery , the cost can´t be a cent above §1000 .",0
"I am a glutton for B-movies . I love the old Drive-In fare like this movie . This film , made for very little money it seems , doe do one thing that some bigger budgeted film fail . It is cheezy . It is gory . It ha no real plot , but it entertained me for an hour and a half . I wa either laughing or covering my eye in shock . There are a few great effect like a shot from INSIDE a guy 's mouth when he get stabbed in the chin by a knife and it poke up through his tongue and slam into the roof of his mouth , and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeball yanked out . But there is also load of zombie , and some psycho killer patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre , and a demon possessed scarecrow . I loved the dialogue that the killer spout a they torture and kill people . It ha great camera work , and some cool editing trick . This one is more original than the first Bloodbath , and the undead look better , but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movie of the 70 's and 80 's and it still ha a cheeze factor that rank mighty high . Do n't expect Romero , just second-rate Fulci . I would say that Horror fan will like it , and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through B-movie Land .",1
Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life . When I saw it for the first time about 2 year ago I wa in stitch for week after it . To date I have seen it a further 17 time and i still laugh my as off each time . For those who dont know Eddie Murphy wa a brilliant stand up comedian before he wa a Hollywood superstar . There is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike Eddie Murphy Raw which wa released in 1987 which go flat during the middle . If you are not the sort of person who ca n't stand swearing then I would n't advise you to see it a you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5-10 second . I gave this a 10 out of 10 because it display the greatest comic genius of them all at his best .,1
"This is a really funny ( and sexy ) movie - that is not just silly but ha great acting . It 's the kind of movie where the character are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater . I saw it at the Boston film festival , and I found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else , and also moved by some of the movie 's more serious part . It 's a unique movie about two doctor , and I do n't want to give anything away but there are some powerful scene a well really funny one - plus the dialogue is great . Wood Harris ' character ha a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana , and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their role . If you get a chance to see it - go - you wo n't be disappointed . It 's worth seeing again . Wood Harris deserves an award .",1
"I very much looked forward to this movie . Its a good family movie ; however , if Michael Landon Jr. 's editing team did a better job of editing , the movie would be much better . Too many scene out of context . I do hope there is another movie from the series , they 're all very good . But , if another one is made , I beg them to take better care at editing . This story wa all over the place and did n't seem to have a center . Which is unfortunate because the other movie of the series were great . I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy ; they 're both great role model . Plus , the romantic side of the viewer always enjoy a good love story .",0
"Now more than ever we need Peace & Love in this world ! This film really showcase the wonderful music of the Broadway show , and the fabulous Choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp ! I saw it again after many year , and it still hold up well . Thank you , MGM/UA for putting this on DVD ! I love the option of seeing in Widescreen . MGM rock for doing this on many of their DVD release . Ya got ta love Treat Williams a Berger and John Savage a Claude . They could n't have picked better actor & actress for this film ! Beverly D'Angelo is such a 'hot mama ' in this film -- I had forgotten just how hot ! WOW ! The supporting cast is absolutely great , with the late great Nell Carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scene , a well a the kooky Charlotte Ray ( Mrs. Garrett on 'Facts Of Life ' ) The story get a little weak toward the end , but the anti-war sentiment of the late 60 's still hold up , and is relevant today . It 's beautifully filmed ( quite a bit on location ) and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen . I saw this movie when it wa released in 1979 when I wa 15 , and wa moved by it then , and it still move me now at 40 . Some other review on here say they think it should have been made sooner -- I do n't think Hollywood wa ready to make such a movie back in the late 60's-early 70 's . The Vietnam War ended in 1975 , and the whole thing hit a little too close to home , I think for this story to be filmed before it wa ( like in 1969 , 70 , 71 ) Bravo to Director Milos Foreman ! I love this film ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's nice to see it again , this time on DVD . It never looked better !",1
"If you enjoy Cleese & all the British 'Pythonesque ' humour of the time , then this little gem is absolutely hilarious . Arthur Lowe is a real treat ! I saw this with friend on TV when it first came out , and it classic quote have formed a part of our joke for 30 year , and will do forever ! I have it on tape and it is continually appreciated . Perhaps some reviewer are taking it too seriously . I ca n't believe it is now only available in the US ( NTSC of course ) , and not in UK , where it should be an essential part of the history of British humour ! !",1
"This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 year ago . After all this time , the young woman return to seek revenge on the men . This story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storm . But it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keep plaguing the old men in their dream and interfering in a young man 's life . The most of what I liked in this film wa the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their death . The special effect were something . Every time I heard her call out to them I would think `` Not that face again . '' But it wa a good movie , I just wish that the pace wa not a slow or the acting not a tiresome . And what I also liked about the movie wa the flashback of the 20 's , very authentic a well a the costume being original .",0
"This ingenious and innovate comedy pack many moment priceless and great sense of pace , though overlong . Chaplin 's satire with several classic scene , he ha dual role a a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and happen bemusing event . Funny and extraordinaries acting of all casting , a the co-star Jack Oakie a Napolini ( Mussolini-alike ) , Henry Daniel a Gasbstich ( Himmler-alike ) and Billy Gilbert a Herring ( Goering ) . Chaplin 's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss.This splendid film contains numerous amusing scene , the funniest are the following : 1 ) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without aware 2 ) Dictator Adenoid Hynkel doing overacting speech including a twisted microphone 3 ) Hynkel playing with an enormous balloon of the world 4 ) The Jew-barber shaving a man fitting to Hungarian Dance number 5 of Brahms 5 ) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber 's chair ; among them . Hitler banned movie exhibition to the Germans due to it satire of him , and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of America.The movie is co-starred by Paulette Goddard , third of his four wife , they were married in 1936 , although no announcement of the marriage wa made later , one time finished The Great Dictator.The picture wa released in 1940 , when Chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the House of Un-American Activities wa the signal for the USA to refuse him re-entry from Britain and he fled to Switzerland .",1
"I saw Anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and a I watch a lot of foreign film in various genre , you have to watch movie in their original language for sure . Not only is it annoying to know the voice do n't belong to the actor , but they always seem cheerful , like the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something . It make an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and I have had to convert a lot of my friend who used to think foreign film are n't a good a North American film - that they are n't `` Hollywood enough '' . Also , they translation is never right , it 's too literal , and screw up the vibe of the movie , even if it 's basically saying the same thing . I watched Anatomy by myself the other week in German then with subtitle with my roommate because he wa on his laptop and did n't want to have to miss part when he could n't see the subtitle because he wa typing . 30 min in and he begged me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitle .

"Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secret to the Soviet Union in the height of the Cold War , `` Falcon And The Snowman '' want to be both suspenseful and philosophical , and wind up falling short in both department . It 's le le Carré than who care . Timothy Hutton star a Christopher Boyce , a former seminarian who , disgusted by Watergate and the middle-class value around him , is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellite for the CIA . Sean Penn play his drug-dealing pal , Daulton Lee , who make himself Boyce 's courier , delivering secret file to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City . An offbeat synth-jazz score , lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone , and lot of scene of guy getting angry in room all combine to deaden what could have a decent moral-dilemma thriller . It 's really Penn 's movie despite the second billing ; his character get to talk turkey with the Russians while Hutton play with his pet falcon . Hutton look like they woke him up five minute before they called `` action '' . With Penn , it 's a crapshoot whether you get a brilliant performance or an over-the-top one . Here , it 's a bit of both , but more the latter , especially in the second half when Lee switch from coke to heroin . He screech . He snort . He crash Russian embassy party . He get pummeled with telephone book . He spit at himself in a mirror , a big goober he must have been saving for a paparazzo . `` I do n't know who my friend are anymore ! '' he cry out . It 's exhausting to just watch him . Penn seems to have modeled Lee somewhat on Dustin Hoffman 's Ratso Rizzo from `` Midnight Cowboy '' , complete with overly nasal line reading and constant eye shifting . John Schlesinger directed this film a well a `` Midnight Cowboy '' , but he seems to have had another Hoffman film in mind , `` The Graduate '' , throwing up scene after scene of Boyce and Lee poolside , trying to decide how to live their life in their gilded cage . Too bad no one suggested plastic . From the opening shot , news footage of American decline juxtaposed with Boyce and his bird , `` Falcon '' make clear it is a message movie , though the message itself is far from clear , probably because the character never come into focus . Is Boyce supposed to be an idealist ? Or is he just a mercenary ? Hutton and Schlesinger do n't seem to know , which make it harder for u . Meanwhile , opportunity to establish some suspense , like Boyce stealing document from the top secret `` Black Vault '' where he work or Lee playing game with the Russians , are interrupted by jump cut to scene of the pair with their family and friend . It 's the normalcy of the story that Schlesinger find interesting , but it 's the least interesting aspect for u . Good stuff : It 's interesting to see a film that work the 1970s vibe so early a this one , referencing Maria Muldaur and Tang . Dorian Harewood , memorable in `` Full Metal Jacket '' , ha a nice turn a Boyce 's paranoid colleague Gene , who show Boyce how to make margarita with a shredder but ha some serious 'Nam issue beneath his partying exterior . Macon McCalman is also fine in a totally different way a the no-nonsense bos who give Boyce his high-security job . David Suchet a the Russian embassy official who deal with Lee make for a fascinating blend of menace and amiability . But `` Falcon And The Snowman '' stand or fall on the the question of the two title character , and neither the actor nor Schlesinger are able to mine much in the way of answer . Worse , after more than two hour in their alternately feral and catatonic company , you do n't really want answer . You just want those credit to roll .",0
"Watching CBS 's `` Surrender , Dorothy '' , I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it ( not because it 's a television movie -- with the dearth of enticing role for slightly older actress , it is n't any wonder why Academy Award winning performer such a Keaton turn to TV -- but because it offer no opportunity for Keaton to shine ) . A single mother , grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter , imposes upon -- and gradually becomes friend with -- the group of young people her daughter wa close to at the time of her accident . Adapted from the novel , this teleplay give u a group of self-absorbed character one would cross the street to avoid . Aside from being coarse and dim , these phony people are incredibly unconvincing , a is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kid reside ( one young man , who wear muscle shirt to tell u he 's gay , hears Diane Keaton say , `` Surrender , Dorothy '' and actually asks , `` That 's from `` The Wizard of Oz '' , right ? `` ... no , genius , it 's from `` Citizen Kane '' ! ) . Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death . She try turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage ( lot of kooky outfit ) , but it doe n't sit well with the viewer since Keaton ha always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way . Here , she 's a crazed harpy who doe n't learn many lesson on her journey of self-discovery ( the movie quickly forgets it 's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom , who appears to be an overage hippie who ha never lost anyone close to her ) . This is the kind of film actor promote on talk show with the caveat , `` It should help a lot of grieving mother out there '' . I ca n't imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer , muddled and baffling . It 's deranged .",0
"Dennis Quaid is tryin ' hard to prove u that Jerry Lee Lewis wa a dumb guy . And he 's doing too much to prove it . TV sequence are very good , like a photocopy of old black and white footage .

I think the only good thing in this movie is to see young Winona Ryder .",0
"I saw The Merchant of Venice in London last week . Great acting by Al Pacino , Jeremy Irons , Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins . Compare to other movie based on Shakespeare 's play , this production ha made the play so easy to understand and follow . Bravo to Michael Radford for directing such top actor . The costume and the scenery are great and since it wa filmed on location in Venice it give the film and authentic flavor . I had read the play over thirty year ago at school and the emphasis wa on the character ' anti-Semitic behavior toward the Jews and the cruelty of the Christians . I do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case I am sure that it will get few Oscar nomination .",1
"Really ! Here the French cinema hit rock bottom , and compared to it , the least appealing of the American adolescent horror movie , the like of `` Friday the thirteenth '' `` Freddy '' and co are masterpiece of the seventh art . It 's all the more infuriating a there were exciting original element : the forêt de Brocéliande and it legend , the druid and King Arthur , all were splendid asset for a dreamlike fantasy and horror film.Alas ! Filmed , a an user aptly pointed out in a fake forest , near Paris , the movie is fake horror , fake Celtic history , fake vestige -you should see the professor ( Wilms who wa a wonderful M.Le Quesnoy in `` la vie est un long fleuve tranquille ) scream for the `` invaluable scrap '' -which the production probably bought in a dime store-fake character , fake excavation ... The boy disguised a druid are unintentionally very funny ; so are the girl who seem to be expert in martial arts.And what can we say of the professor ? of the monster ? A ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce.To think that people can spend money for such drivel when artist are still waiting for a producer ! Word to the wise : Maurice Leblanc wrote a marvelous story dealing with druid and old ceremony in his Arsene Lupin saga called `` l'île aux trente cercueils '' .A miniseries wa made 30 year ago.Avoid this `` Broceliande '' garbage and try to see it instead .",0
"`` Intensive Care '' by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movie ever made.This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offer some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted a a Professor Bruckner.The acting is abysmal , the action is slow and the climax is laughable.A famous surgeon ha a car accident.He lie in a coma seven year and then he wake up and go on a bloody rampage . `` Intensive Care '' is clearly influenced by American slasher film including `` Halloween '' and `` Friday the 13th '' series.The killing are hilarious and the dialog are painfully stupid.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.You 'll laugh until it hurt with this one-you can believe me !",0
"One of the best 'guy ' movie I 've ever seen ha to be the Wind and the Lion . Gad , the scene ... Raisouli 's bandit swarm over the wall ... A staid British gentleman calmly get up from tea with Candice Bergen and drop three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat . A whisper from the ghost of Empire ... Lest we forget ! Lest we forget ! U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long , long gone _Brooklyn_ . They were carrying Krags , it should have been Lees , but , oh wow . And the Winchester 97 blowing large hole in obstreperous native and even more obstreperous and faithless Europeans ... Raisouli -- Sean Connery , o , Wow ! -- wondering 'What kind of gun doe Roosevelt use ? '' Teddy Roosevelt -- Brian Keith , o , Wow ! -- wondering `` What kind of gun doe Raisouli use ? ' and writing yet another angry letter to Winchester about the stock on his Winchester 95 . Raisouli , armed with but a sword ... A Prussian cavalry officer , HOLSTERING his pistol and drawing HIS sword ... Honor . That 's something long dead , from a world long gone , but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of child into a building ... Milious at Milious 's magnificent best , and now out on DVD .",1
"This is film that wa actually recommended to me by my dentist , and am I glad he did ! The blend of British humor ( should I say , Humour ? ) and the reality of a lost , middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot . Add to that mix the reality of what it take to actually grow pot ( those plant under the bush were NOT going to make it without the TLC they received ) , and it is a truly hilarious , yet touching film . I laugh every time I conjure the vision of all the bar patron sitting in their lawn chair with sunglass on counting down the light ! Maybe it 's just my Mendocino County blood , but the Brits definitely got this one right ! ! 10/10",1
"The small California town of Diablo is plagued with mysterious death after sheriff Robert Lopez unearths an ancient box.Legend ha it that the box hold the sixteenth-century Mexican demon named Azar.FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murder and join force with the sheriff 's daughter , Dominique and Mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon . `` The Legend of Diablo '' is an absolute garbage.The film lack scare and gore , the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad.The animation is the only one aspect of the film I enjoyed.I 'm a big fan of indie horror flick , for example I loved `` Torched '' , '' Live Feed '' , '' Bone Sickness '' or `` Neighborhood Watch '' , unfortunately `` The Legend of Diablo '' is a huge misfire.Definitely one to avoid .",0
"Southern Cross , written and directed by James Becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor 's effort . A formula film is not necessarily bad if it pay off on it 's promise , which this film doe not . It is a tiresome concoction of movie cliche that can be traced to a thousand different film from the past . It is full of random and empty plot twist that add nothing but aimless action , such a a trip by the protagonist to a ghost town where the villain ( unexplainedly ) follow them . This wa obviously concocted a an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous , with people popping in and out of doorway and running past window while firing pistol at each other . It make one believe that somebody told Becket there wa a ghost town in the Chilean foothill and he said , `` Oh great , let do a shoot out scene there . '' Do n't even waste your rental money on this . It is a bunch of random bit and piece from a hundred different film thrown together to call an action drama .",0
"Besides the fact that my list of favorite movie maker is : 1 ) Stanley Kubrick 2 ) God Allmighty 3 ) the rest ... this movie actually is better than the book ( and the TV miniseries though this is an easy feat , considering the director ) . The flawless filming stile , the acting and ( Kubrick 's all time number one skill ) the music - make it THE masterpiece of horror . I watched the TV miniseries a few year ago and liked the story and I had my hope about this when I got a hold of it . IT BLEW ME AWAY ! ! ! It is far better than I ever imagined it . It start slow ( Kubrick trademark ) and ha a lot of downtime that build up the suspense . The intro scene is a classic by all mean and I watched it about 20 time just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film . Also the film doe n't offer a lot of gore ( it ha just enough and it is by no mean tasteless ) a trend that I hate in recent day horror film . Just watch it !",1
"What can be said about such a pathetic movie ? - Very bad acting ! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression : fear mixed with weakness . Like a poor beaten dog ... The other actress ( the one who play the evil ) look like the female double of Ozzy Osbourne , with an awful red wig . The other actor are so pitiful that they do n't even worth being described . - There 's absolutely no plot . The story begin with possibility but go nowhere : we do n't know anything about the meaning of `` 11:11 '' , nor who Rayden really is , excepted the simple `` she 's evil '' or `` she 's a child of Apocalypse '' ... which is not an explanation . We do n't know why the parent have been killed , what kind of danger is growing and why Sara wa chosen . As the film go on , we just watch pseudo-scary scene , with a bad music . Moreover , the end doe n't tell anything : we just see two possibility a if one of them wa a bonus scene or the director 's cut ... There 's no plot , so no possible interpretation . - `` 11:11 '' is just full of clichés ! It is so obvious that i could n't help laughing . For example : the deserted library or the bathroom scene , ghost silhouette walking with a blast of wind , ... there 's even the fashionable `` little scary girl '' a in `` Dark Water '' or `` The Ring '' . Of course , the main character is bullied at school and look like a stereotyped Gothic girl ( dark hair , red lip , skinny , black clothes ) . Is it an obligation to make her credible ? I do n't think so . The psychology of Sara is so few developed and so typical that it doe n't make her credible , nor endearing . - Terrible direction : a i said , nothing original , everything ha already been seen a thousand time and is used here without any real purpose . - There are some funny incoherence . For example , i do n't know if `` ghost science '' , `` paranormal course '' or whatever is taught in American university ... In Europe it is really not the case : teacher talking about negative energy or using `` unmaterial '' creature sensor ... ridiculous . Also : how can you watch a movie shot in the sixty with a Super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hour of your time for a digitalization ( in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen ) AND how can you , on this old film , isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face ? I wonder if the director ha ever tried to digitize an old analogical film ... Eventually , `` 11:11 '' just worth being watched if you like to laugh at silly movie , or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch ... But it 's an expensive way to fall asleep !",0
"Before I start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other review from australia and overseas . In australian slang `` thong '' are a pair of rubber sandal ( not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear ) , `` stubbies '' are a brand of australian short , a `` stubby '' is a small can sized bottle of beer , and a `` stubby holder '' is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer . If you love black comedy about smalltime criminal then you will love this movie , unfortunatley a lot of people on IMDB with weak stomach and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately make this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is . A lot of reviewer have also compared it to Lock/Stock and Pulp Fiction , while it is the same genre , it is a completely different and original style . A lot of reviewer have also panned this movie for using Heath Ledger 's character dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie , without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother wa killed by the same villain that wish to kill heath character , this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand . This movie is also reminiscent of Lock/Stock and Reservoir dog in that it is the Director/writers debut feature , and for a debut feature it rate a well a these two movie , a a matter of fact like Lock/Stock and Reservoir Dogs I rate this movie a a 10/10 for a director/writers debut , unfortunately unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan fails to live up to expectation in his subsequent movie like Ned Kelly . This movie is one that you should definitely add to your DVD collection and is one that hold up to several viewing quite easily .",1
"I know , I know , `` Plan 9 from Outer Space '' is the worst movie , or maybe `` Manos , the Hands of Fate . '' But I ca n't get worked up over those sock-monkey movie . Of * course * they 're bad . How could they be any good ? But if you 're talking about movie with respectable production value and bankable talent , the T. rex of all turkey ha to be `` Yentl . '' All the treacly phoniness , all the self-absorbed asininity , that stain everything Barbra Streisand ha done since 1964 , reach it culmination in this movie . From it lonely summit of awfulness , `` Yentl '' look back to `` A Star is Born '' and forward to `` The Mirror Has Two Faces . '' There is nothing else quite like it . What emotional undertow dragged Streisand out to make this movie I would rather not speculate , and what audience she wa playing to I can not possibly imagine , although I 'll bet there 's a nine in ten chance you are n't a member of it . Nobel Prize-winner and saintly guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer wa so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it . It is a tribute to Streisand 's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only did n't commit suicide , but went on to make more awful movie .",0
"When Jim Wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time , the `` Slumber Party Massacre '' series , I wa ecstatic . I had been waiting for a new installment for literally year . So , production began and very small bit and piece on the shoot and the actor involved were released until the shoot wrapped . Then , the announcement of a title change . No longer would this new sequel be titled `` Slumber Party Massacre IV , '' but `` Cheerleader Massacre '' instead . I wa a bit disappointed , but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film I had waited so long to happen . I wa still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it . Maybe a month ago , some very advanced copy of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewer , who got to see the film month before it release date . A few review leaked on the net and judging by them , I began to become apprehensive on Jim Wynorski 's `` Cheerleader Massacre . '' Tonight , I got to see the film for the first time in full length and I am still scratching my head . As I read in another review , `` Cheerleader Massacre '' is definitely NOT a new installment in the `` Slumber Party Massacre '' series , but a slasher flick all on it own . And a bad one at that . Before I get into the specific of the film , let me first state what an enormous fan of Jim Wynorski 's film I am . I always thought him to be a true camp genius , with a winner almost every time . Yes , his movie are made on shoestring budget and do n't contain the most top-notch acting around , but they 're fun nonetheless . They are what they are : campy movie you watch when you want to have a good time . From `` Sorority House Massacre II , '' to `` Hard to Die , '' to `` Chopping Mall , '' Jim ha produced the good on more than one occasion . One of the reason why I wa excited that this film would be his latest project . `` Cheerleader Massacre '' doe not ( in my opinion ) reflect any of the film I had seen this director/writer create in the past . Firstly , the production wa extremely inexpensive and the film wa actually shot on videotape , something I had never seen Jim do before . The actor were mediocre , to say the least , and the story is almost laughable . The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa , rather than an escaped lunatic . Of course , the film is littered with female nudity . This is a Jim Wynorski movie we 're talking about , folk . But some of the boob-shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time . There is an extremely long shower scene , containing the cheerleading coach , that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in Jim 's `` Sorority House Massacre II . '' The girl even bathe herself almost in the exact same way . `` Cheerleader Massacre '' is also extremely cliched , to say the least . The opening scene is literally something we 've all seen in HUNDREDS of past slasher flick . A guy and a girl making out , on the verge of consummating their relationship when ... you guessed it . They 're hacked to piece . Brinke Stevens , who I 've never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place , also give one of her stiffest and forced performance in her small cameo . We 're talkin ' possible cue card here . She recall some incident her character endured by the killer seen here twenty year ago to the police , while footage of the original `` Slumber Party Massacre '' play . Why wa footage from the original film used if it wa definitely not a new `` SPM '' ? I have no idea . There is also two explosion seen in this movie that I am almost certain were recycled from other film . Not only doe this film recycle FOOTAGE from past film , but it also recycles the score from other film a well . Some of the music used in `` Humanoids from the Deep '' ( which wa also recycled prior for `` The Coroner '' ) can be heard throughout the entire film . There are at least two more a well that I can not identify , but am certain have been used before . After sitting through this film 's horrendous acting , ridiculous story , non-existent gore/special effect , and camcorder-like quality , I am having some serious concern toward Mister Wynorski 's career . Has the man who delighted audience with film in the past finally lost his niche ? Only time will tell . Oh , and let 's not forget his newest film . A new installment in the `` Sorority House Massacre '' film , now titled `` Final Exam . '' I think I 'm seeing a pattern here ...",0
"Too bad a couple of comment before me do n't know the fact of this case . It is based on actual event , a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the Wilmington , DE/Philadelphia PA region from '96 through 2000 . I have to admit I wa highly skeptical of how Hollywood would dramatize the actual history and event and wa actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what wa constantly reported on local newscast and Philadelphia Inquirer news story throughout the time period . Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress ( who I really like in Cold Case ) who played Fahey looked nothing like her ( Anne Marie wa actually prettier ) . I have to admit though that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of personality that wa revealed a Capano 's and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period . Details of the case were right on ... no deviation of dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet , gun , furniture , and cooler . In conclusion , I also wanted to add that I have met Tom Carper many time at various function ( a good man , despite being a politician ) and I am so glad that he pulled the string in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime . Guys like Capano are real and it wa great to see him finally put behind bar .",1
"I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minute after the credit ran , so I did n't know who had done it at first . The longer I saw it , the more I started thinking , `` Jesus , this look like an Albert Pyun flick . '' Was n't quite sure , though , for two main reason : the photography wa quite good ( and the Utah desert scenery wa beautiful ) , and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance a Simon , a murderous cyborg , but with some style and a sense of humor . Paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liner he shot out , because Albert Pyun ha n't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career . Unfortunately , Paulin doe n't have all that much screen time before he 's gone , and the movie 's the worse for it . Lance Henriksen , playing the evil head cyborg , growl his way through his part , a he 's done in countless other movie like this . I do n't know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing ; maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it . He go through the movie looking ( and sounding ) like he just woke up , and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent . Kathy Long , the nominal hero , ha a great body , is attractive , ha a great body , fight extremely well , ha a great body , and doe n't have an iota of acting talent , but that doe n't matter in a movie like this . This being an Albert Pyun film , it 's full of the trademark that we 've all come to know and love : inane and idiotic dialog , choppy editing , and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured , `` Ah , nobody 'll ever notice . '' As bad a this movie is , however , it 's a shade above most of Pyun 's other effort -- this is `` Citizen Kane '' compared to his brain-numbing `` Adrenaline : Feel the Rush '' , for example . The fight are pretty well done , if repetitive ( after she knock down eight or nine guy one after the other , you find yourself saying , `` Alright already , go to something else '' ) , and Long is very athletic ( and , a a previous poster ha noted , ha a great derrière ) . It 's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination , but it 's not anywhere near a incoherent and incompetent a Pyun 's usual extravaganza . You could do worse than rent this movie -- not much worse , granted , but worse nonetheless .",0
"The movie open upon Julian Sands , lying on his back , a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he hold it , about two foot above him . That wa so provocative , and I thought , `` Here we go ! A good vampire movie ! '' And then it died . That wa literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination . It wa slow , uneventful drivel thereafter . I wa vastly disappointed , a my previous experience with Sands ' acting wa quite enjoyable . However , this attempt wa obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired . Even Julian Sands 's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie . It rate a 1.1/10 from ... the Fiend : .",0
"About twenty minute into this movie , I wa already bored . Quite simply , these character were fairly dull . Occasionally , something enjoyable would happen , but then thing would slow down again . Fortunately , my patience wa eventually rewarded , and the ending to this movie wa n't bad at all . However , it wa by no mean good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minute . So , I would say that the movie wa mediocre overall , and considering all of the talent in the cast , I 'd call this a disappointment .",0
"` Manna From Heaven ' is a delightfully compelling film . Within the shifting paradox of value in middle-class Americans from 40 year ago to the present day , the plot tweak the concern and hope of an interesting range of ` Damon Runyonesque ' character . Their struggle with moral dilemma , dotting on ` what might have been , ' hope to yet fulfill youthful dream , romantic yearning , and ` hit it big ' combine to make a most entertaining film . Rather than relying upon ` in-your- face ' sexual explicitness , the burgeoning relationship between Inez and Mac/Bake is classically subtle but clear . His untying the knot in her shoelace at the Art Gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstanding The script 's crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast . One of the few film I have ever fone to see twice in it opening run , ` Manna From Heaven ' definitely warrant national distribution . Conrad F. Toepfer",1
"If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a ten-foot pole . But after I heard some positive buzz , and knowing it made some noise at Cannes , I decided to give it a try . What I got is a truly enjoyable movie , based on a very entertaining plot . Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role a nurse ' Betty , a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience . I also liked Morgan Freeman ( no surprise ) and wa pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock . The film bounce continuously between comedy , drama , romance , and thriller . Yet despite this apparent identity crisis , it hold up quite well . I found my eye glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story . The entire cast is strong , if not spectacular . My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute ( who made a splash a few year ago with the very impressive and dark In the Company of Men ' ) relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood convention . The mood-creating musical effect he crammed down our throat during each sentimental scene were unbearable ! And he did the standard old `` let 's take some of the minor character and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance '' trick , just to make absolutely certain everyone go home with a smile on their face . Why must director and writer treat their audience like idiot ? ? But the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritation . In a very subpar year for movie , 'Nurse Betty ' rank a one of the more pleasant surprise of 2000 . 8 out of 10 .",1
"This flick wa even better then 'Waiting for Guffman ' . The great strength in these two film lie in the brilliant character acting by Guest and Levy 's little second-second city troupe . If one find this movie boring or pointless , God help 'em , they just did n't get it . It is a mockumentary , something at which Guest and Levy have a genius for . At the end of the movie where Guest 's southern down home dog lover tell u that to relax after the show , he went to Israel to work on a 'caboose ' , or when he tell u that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic of an ancient Egyptian holding a tiny ancient Egyptian in it 's hand , I realized it is moment like this that make life worth living . Thank you Mr.Guest and Mr.Levy , and God bless you .",1
"I stopped short of giving `` Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House '' 10/10 due to an aspect that make u in the 21st century cringe a little bit : the fact that a black person is the faithful servant ( somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit ) . But other than that , the movie 's a hoot . Portraying middle class New York couple Jim ( Cary Grant ) and Muriel Blandings ( Myrna Loy ) trying to build a house in Connecticut , this flick ha something for everyone . Grant is his usual flippant self , while Loy doe quite well a merely a wife . But Melvyn Douglas add some real laugh a Jim 's and Muriel 's lawyer Bill Cole , who seems to have more plan than he 's making clear . As for the house itself ... throughout most of the movie , you 'll probably feel ambiguous a to whether or not you want to live there . The builder , contractor , and others also provide their fair share of laugh . All in all , a comedy classic . Also starring Louise Beavers , Reginald Denny , Sharyn Moffett , Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr .",1
"This self proclaimed `` very talented artist '' have directed easily the worst Spanish film of the 21st century . Lack of emotion , coherence , rhythm , skill , humor ... it repeat the same situation over and over again . It show no character development . It doe not even show any violent and/or sexual content , and it doe not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre . So lame it should be shown at film school a an example of `` what not to do '' in a first movie . BTW where the hell is the `` talent '' ? there are scene which have been shot almost identically ; there are scene which have two or more master shot and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason . The camera almost never move , a if the `` very talented artist '' wa afraid of showing his lack of visual skill . The actor playing the main role act like amateur , and the supporting cast is hardly believable . There are more hole than plot in the script ( if ever there wa one ) ... A really disheartening movie , and a whatsoever talented director .",0
"This production wa made in the middle 1980s , and appears to be the first serious attempt to put BLEAK HOUSE on celluloid . No film version of the novel wa ever attempted ( it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve a counterpoint to each other , so that it would have been very hard to prune it down ) . The novel wa the only attempt by Dickens to make a central narrator ( one of two in the work ) a woman , Esther Summerson . Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle , who ( in typical Dickens style ) mistreat her . She is illegitimate , but they wo n't tell her anything about her parentage . Later we get involved with the gentry , Sir Leicester Dedlock , and his wife . Lady Honoria Deadlock ( Dame Diana Rigg ) is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor Tulkinghorn ( Peter Vaughn ) . We also are involved with the action of Richard Carstone ( Esther 's boyfriend ) in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case , Jarndyce v. Jarndyce , which everyone ( even Richard 's cousin John Jarndyce - played by Desmond Elliot ) warns is not worth the effort . Dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction . Starting with the breach of promise case in PICKWICK PAPERS , Dickens looked closely at the law . Mr. Bumble said it wa `` a as '' in OLIVER TWIST and Dickens would consistently support that view . He look at the slum a breeding ground for crime in TWIST , that the law barely try to cure . He attack the Chancery and outdated estate law , a well a too powerful solicitor and greedy lawyer ( Tulkinghorn , Vholes ) in BLEAK HOUSE . In LITTLE DORRIT he attack the debtor ' prison ( he had hit it also in David COPPERFIELD ) . In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he look at testator and will . In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently wa going to go to a murder trial . Dickens wa far more critical of legal institution than most of his contemporary , including Thackeray . But the novel also look at other problem ( like charity and religious hypocrisy , the budding Scotland Yard detective force , social snobbery in the industrial revolution ) . He also us the novel to satirize various people : Leigh Hunt the writer , Inspector Fields of Scotland Yard , and even the notorious Maria Manning . Most of these point were kept in this fine mini-series version . If it is shown again on a cable station , catch it .",1
"Without a doubt , the best Burt Reynolds film ever ! Even better than Smokey and the Bandit . This wa probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor , action , mystery and style that is missing in today 's film . This one ha it all : A psychotic Henry Silva jacked up on PCP , $ 1,000 a night call girl , ninja assassin and Burt Reynolds getting his finger sliced off , one by one , with a butterfly knife . The film is based on the novel by William Diehl who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR , another one of my all-time favorite . This movie is worth watching just to see Henry Silva get shot six time , crash through a window , and fall thirty story from the top of an Atlanta high-rise . This is probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history , performed by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson . Robinson also played `` Moke '' in the Elmore Leonard movie STICK , also starring Burt Reynolds . Stick feature another great Dar Robinson stunt . Robinson fall from a Miami apartment building and unloads all six shot from a .44 magnum on his way down . Very cool stuff . SHARKY 'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama . I never understood why this film flopped the way it did . If Burt did more film like this , he would 've built a better reputation for himself . He prof to be a talented director with Sharky , a well a a gifted actor . Burt is supported by Brian Kieth , Charles Durning , Bernie Casey , Richard Libertini , Rachel Ward , and everyone 's favorite bad guy Henry Silva . PLEASE remake this classic film ! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other hot actor and you 've got a great movie just waiting to be filmed . I give it a 9 out of 10",1
"Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town , she 's fifteen year old and her birthday is coming up in one week . Since Melissa is beautiful , every boy in town want to hook up with her , but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die . To be honest the real reason I wanted to watch this film is because Dana Kimmel of Friday The 13th pt 3 wa in it which is n't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie . When I started watching it I realized that `` Sweet Sixteen '' is n't a very good slasher , it 's really dull and boring and just doe n't go anywhere . After over an hour , only three murder have occurred and the story ha n't really developed in any possible way . The movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just a with many other slasher flick from the 80 , the movie suffers from being too dark at time . The acting is actually pretty good though and Melissa 's character is easy to sympathize with , even though she 's a complete slut . The story line is n't completely rubbish but it 's just way too dull to keep you interested , the only thing that kept me interested wa Melissa she wa stunning and Dana Kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie . All in all pretty dull slasher flick that doe n't go anywhere I 'd definitely would n't recommend it to Slasher fan .",0
"This film is a very funny film . The violence is bad , the acting is ... Well Dani , stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . The random chick wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lad in . Personally , i think this movie really doe suck . The story and character COULD be very good , if say the directing , the actor and other little nibby thing were made better . But the film is just bad , the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it ha Danni in it . This film is possibly the worst B-rate film ever . And , believe me that 's hard to achieve , especially when you 're competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuse for `` serious '' horror movie . I 'm not a CoF fan , and so i just see this a another rubbish movie ... A really bad one . If Dani made this a a comedy then , good going him . Very well done . Over than that though , i rate it low , for it 's crappiness . Watch it when you 're in a happy , happy , joy , joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you 're high on multiple different type of drug .",0
"The first time I saw this movie , it did n't seem to go anywhere . When I watched it a second time though , it made a lot more sense . Give it a chance , watch it more than once , there are a lot of key element that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it . The Cohen brother brilliantly weave actual happening of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline . The combination of Clooney 's leading role blend well with Turturro and Nelson 's supporting act . John Goodman 's appearance in the movie is hilarious . The soundtrack is great a well . This movie ha become a household favorite for my family . 10/10 , for sure .",1
"This barely watchable film wa a bit of an ordeal to sit through . None of the segment are good , but at least the first one wa mildly amusing , and the middle one wa somewhat imaginative . The final one wa just plain brutal , and after sitting through two weak comedic short , the third one wa truly painful to watch . Even by the low standard of a National Lampoon movie , this one seemed especially boring and joyless .",0
"A wasted effort . On the surface it 's a typical disaster movie : we 're involved in the life of a few people who get caught up in the Big Event . However , the script is so awful and there 's so much explaining of the character ' background within the dialogue that we feel we 're being treated like moron . Even Sesame Street did n't explain the origin of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died : we can work it out . Someone thought that entering 'Enron ' into the script would give it currency when discussing power company . The acting is by and large bland , with the exception of the older performer ( Randy Quaid , Brian Dennehy ) , and after the first hour , I could n't care le about who the storm took out . But maybe there are the special effect to watch . Sadly , no . Even on a 20-year-old TV set I could see one tractor and trailer were computer-generatedbadly . Maybe there are budgetary limitation , so I can forgive that one . Footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real , but I kept telling myself I had seen that before . This site confirms it : it wa from an earlier film , Nowhere to Land . So in summary , the only good bit are from another film , and when you see the best action sequence compressed into a 30-second network promo , it make Category 6 look quite good . My advice : rely on your network to do some good 30-second clip , watch them , and save yourself two night .",0
"First of all , we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movie you 'll see that the character have these moment where they are the same . His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far ... and counting . The story begin in the ( not so far ) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that ha swept most of humanity from the face of the earth . The story seems to go towards SF but i think it closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story . About that . Movies tend to be faster and slower at some point and develop more towards the end than the beginning but a you see this movie you 'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing fact that doe not speed up nor slow down . Its the one and the same speed that flow gently and pretty good . But that doe n't mean that the ending wont pull your nerve , cause it pretty good . As far a the direction go , it is prefect . Movies a such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one ha become far better . So , if you are getting ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or some action , you 'll miss it . B There should be more movie like this .",1
"The basic plot of 'Marigold ' boast of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept a a backdrop . An American actress Marigold , played by Ali Carter get stuck in India . Worse that , she is out of money . She then decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical , so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation . Here she get to meet Indian choreographer Prem , played by Salman Khan . Basically , the movie fails at the script level . Just by calling a film a Hollywood venture doe n't guarantee quality cinema . Marigold stand out a the best example . The art direction is weak and outdated . Musically , Marigold turn out to be a dud . Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy 's is far from being acknowledged a a decent hear . Actingwise , Salman delivers of his most amateurish performance till date . Ali Larter is good and ha immense screen presence . Performance wise too , she is good . One can also find good review regarding this movie at http : //www.comingsoon.net/films.php ? id=36310",0
"Pet Sematary , though a nice 80 's Horror movie , with a nice Director and atmosphere , IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati . It 's clear that Stephen King ha copied almost all the idea from this director ( the movie Zeder wa made before King wrote the book ) The cat , the ground , everything wa copied , this is a case of plagiary , but , being Stephen Kind a famous American writer , it 's totally normal that he can get away with this , it 's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italians movie with no -budget ( and in part , it 's crap itself ... ) but the original idea , I repeat it , it 's Italian director Avati Let the world know",0
"Sharp , well-made documentary focusing on Mardi Gras bead . I have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate idea about a larger , more complex , and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home . I am sure most people have heard story about sweatshop and understand the basic motif behind profit and capitalism , and globalism 's effect on poorer nation ( however people feel about it ) . Rather than expound on these subject and get up on a soapbox ( not that there 's anything wrong with that , other than such documentary typically preach to the converted ) , this documentary simply show Mardi Gras bead , how they are manufactured , by what people , and under what condition , and then how they are utilized by consumer at the end of the process . It openly and starkly investigates the motivation of everyone involved in the process , including worker , factory management , American importer , and finally , the consumer at the end of the chain . I felt a little sickened by this ; equally by the Mardi Gras reveler , but also by the way the worker in China have accepted their situation a normal and par for the course ( even if they have some objection to the detail of how they are managed ) . The footage of the street sweeper cleaning up the bead off the street at the end , made a particular impression . But that wa just my reaction ; I can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently . Unlike other documentary on this subject , I do n't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this . This is ultimately a story about human being and our relation to the good we produce and consume . If you have ever bought a product made in the Far East , this should give you something to think about . Outstanding and highly recommended . Need to see more documentary like this . Kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film .",1
"As an avid Gone With the Wind fan , I wa disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important character . Luckily , the film on it own wa a wonderful piece . When the book Scarlett came out , I read it in hope of following two of my favorite literary character farther on their journey together . While the book lack any true quality , it remains a good story , and , a long a I wa able to separate it from the original , wa and still is enjoyable . However , I consider the six hour I spent watching the `` Scarlett '' miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hour of my life . Discrediting any of the original character trait so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell 's book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationship that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the character refused to examine the trait that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaf out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel , Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an `` arrangement '' with Rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relative in Savannah . Eventually , she accompanies her cousin Colum , a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood , to Ireland , to further explore her family 's `` root that go deep , '' and is eventually named `` The O'Hara , '' the head of the family . While her duty a The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara , Scarlett venture out into the world of the English landowner , and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their party . She , having been scorned by Rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry Luke , the earl of Fenton , until Rhett come along in a clichéd `` night-on-white-horse '' - type of a rescue . The `` Scarlett '' miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family , the series show Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .",0
"Just like last year event WWE New Years Revolution 2006 wa headlined by an Elimination Chamber match . The difference between last year and this year match however wa the entertainment value . In reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany , New York with the WWE Championship . Those men were current champion John Cena , Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels . There wa no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookie ; Carlito or Chris Masters . And Kane ? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998 , and that wa only for one night . It wa obvious he wa n't going to be the one either . Last year match wa a thrilling affair with six of the best WWE had to offer . 2006 wa a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far . The only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event . Out strolled Vince McMahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber . It wa then announced that Edge wa cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there . With no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the Elimination Chamber match John Cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heel in WWE . This wa the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night . The undercard , like last year , wa truly atrocious . Triple H and The Big Show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away . HHH picked up the win but that wa never in any real doubt wa it ? Any pay-per-view that ha both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really doe it . The King pinned Helms ( who book this stuff ? ) and Big Vis tasted defeat against the wasted Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his Mama . The woman of the WWE also had a busy night . There wa the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match which wa won by Ashley and the Woman 's Championship wa also on the line . In a match , I thought would have been left to brew till WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match . Trish won the contest but it wa evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future . The opening contest of the night pitted soon to be WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion , Ric Flair . This could have been better but it wa a battered and bloody Flair that retained after a disqualification finish . Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry . So New Years Revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion . The only good thing from that is knowing that for the WWE the only way is up . They do n't get much worse than this .",0
"I wa just looking at the 100 bottom movie according to IMDb user seeing if there wa anything to review that I have n't yet and I found this little screen gem . One of those occasion when you see a movie ranked a one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually like it . Darn , well I guess I will get ridiculed and spat upon here , but for me this wa a pretty good flick when I saw it . It ha been awhile however , I remember it used to come on HBO late at night and I watched it two or three time and I have n't seen it really since and I would love to watch it again now knowing Jolie wa in it . The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutch of this corporation and some bounty hunter after them . I think that is basically all there is to it , throw in a few scene with Jack Palance and we have our movie . Some good action here and there , and some blood and violence a well . There is also a love story at play a well a the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other . The dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at time and it is by far not a top notch film , but for a b-movie it is really good . I do n't know if it wa a theatrical release though because it doe not seem high quality enough for that , but it doe make for one of the better direct to video if it wa one of those .",1
"Attractive husband and wife writing team Robert Wagner ( a Joel Gregory ) and Kate Jackson ( a Donna Gregory ) arrive at the spooky mansion of actress `` Lorna Love '' ( actually , silent film star Harold Lloyd 's house ) . Mr. Wagner and Ms. Jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star 's biography . Wagner ha a personal interest in the project , since his father wa once the famed star 's lover . Mysterious event unfold , and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde , who is `` perfectly preserved '' in a crypt on the estate ; moreover , the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband , and murdering Jackson ! This is very much a `` Night of Dark Shadows '' variation , co-starring genuine `` Dark Shadows '' alumnus Kate Jackson , who know and play her part well . Robert Wagner lack David Selby 's intensity . Sylvia Sidney ( a Mrs. Josephs ) sidestep Grayson Hall . Marianna Hill is not a match for Lara Parker ( or Diana Millay ) . Bill Macy ( a Oscar Payne ) is good in a part that would have been played by John Karlen ( in a Dan Curtis production ) . There are smooth cameo by Joan Blondell , John Carradine , and Dorothy Lamour . Ms. Lamour 's delivery resembles Joan Bennett , which begs the question : why did n't producer Aaron Spelling get more of the original `` Dark Shadows '' regular ? Director E.W . Swackhamer wa Bridget Hanley 's husband ; he worked with Ms. Blondell on `` Here Come the Brides '' , and with Jackson on `` The Rookies '' . `` Death at Love House '' ha , arguably , a tighter storyline than the `` Night of Dark Shadows '' film ; it differs in the movie star angle ; and , in it `` Father Eternal Fire '' ending , it more closely resembles the TVseries ' `` Laura the Phoenix '' storyline . * * * * Death at Love House ( 9/3/76 ) E.W .

"This film is mildly entertaining if one neglect to acknowledge it numerous incongruity of plot and sheer lack of believability . Bruce Willis a `` The Jackal '' never seems to live up to his reputation a a cunning mastermind of the underworld . Instead , he bumbles about in broad daylight , parading a mishmash of shoddy disguise . Why this man ha never been captured before ( or even identified ) is beyond me . Not once is the audience impressed by his cleverness or daring ; considering the price he demand for his service ( an exorbitant $ 70 million ) , his method are decidedly low-budget and stupid . As for those in pursuit of him , they are at least a ridiculous in their behavior . They show no sense of expertise , instead relying on half-baked conjecture which sends them traversing across the country at their whim . Incredibly , these far-fetched guess ( maybe he bought a boat , maybe he 's in Chicago , etc etc ) invariably lead them straight to the Jackal , who yet again escape their clumsy grasp . Richard Gere , whose Irish accent fade in and out like a distant radio station , play the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the FBI . He actually make a compatible partner , if only because his mean are a amateurish and inept a his professional pal . At one point , he actually confronts the infamous Jackal , but unfortunately the FBI , although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight , fail to equip him with a weapon or any mean of communication . What kind of operation are they running here ? The film also appears overly reliant on gruesome violence , which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever . The supposedly stealthy Jackal act more like a demented and senseless serial killer , eliminating people for sport and writing on a victim 's cheek with blood . The film 's action scene are both predictable and unrealistic , and many moment are ruined with melodrama . This movie is poorly executed on many level , the one bright spot being the ever consistent Sidney Poitier . Avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think a you watch it .",0
"Raymond Burr star a an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend ( Dick Foran ) thanks to his affection for his friend 's wife ( Angela Lansbury ) . This wa a full year before he started doing Perry Mason , so the movie might be of particular interest to his fan if it wa the inspiration for his casting . There is n't all that much else here that 's interesting though . Lansbury is always good , but her character here is very one dimensional and the motif for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious . There 's an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson a a painter who 's also in love with the `` femme fatale '' , but the Burr character is pretty straightforward . It 's frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scene with Lansbury , and his halting delivery doe not match his character here very well a it doe in most film I 've seen him in . There 's no mystery at all really , and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that Burr 's character is setting up the Lansbury character to implicate herself ( double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder , presumably ) . He doe so with a very large tape recorder which she doe n't notice when she come into the room I guess . A few perhaps unintentionally fun moment and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for TV .",0
"Purchased this film for one dollar and figured I could never go wrong , my big mistake wa watching it . Enjoyed the acting of Ice-T and the rapping which gave lot of class to this film about Los Angeles and the world of pimp . There is a boxer who kill one of his opponent in a practice ring and who ha a career , but because of mental problem from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires . He get hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girl that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up . This boxer fall in love with the bos 's girlfriend and all kind of trouble start . This is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy .",0
"The story in this movie is fairly implausible B grade stuff , but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead , and in 1940 , that meant Peter Lorre . And Peter is at his creepiest in this one a island owner Stephen Danel , who get prisoner paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine . Upon arrival the parolee discover that they are slave mine worker that can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel . Only two thing seem to have it worse off than the slave ; Danel 's wife , and monkey . Monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably lead to the only meat the slave get . Lorre is perfect in his role here , and creep up the screen in industrial-strength fashion . Although the script is not Casablanca caliber , the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scene . This is a very watchable story , but I 'm not sure what niche this movie filled . Too long for a short subject , and too short for a feature length film , I 'm not sure how this wa marketed to theater . I just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning TCM showing . Lorre fan will not want to miss this one if they have n't seen it .",1
"I saw this with few expectation and absolutely loved it ! Bend it like Beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl . This is Parminder Nagra ( `` ER '' ) 's breakout role , playing Jess , a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football ( that 's soccer to u North Americans ) . And even though she 's actually much older than her character , she play the role pitch-perfect . This is a movie about friendship - specifically Jess 's friendship with Jules ( Keira Knightley ) , her teammate who is also going through family issue , especially with her mom , who wear purple nail polish and little bow on her shoe , and who want Jules to be more feminine , wear lacy underwear and flirt with boy and is terrified that playing sport mean her daughter is a lesbian . Jules and Jess both love playing the game and have issue trying to convince their family to let them go after their dream . They also , unfortunately , both love the same man - Joe , their coach ( played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ) . The love triangle cause some strain in their friendship . In some spot , Bend It Like Beckham fall into clichés . In others , scene drag on far too long , and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing . But this wa a refreshingly fun film about growing up , culture clash , and the love of football . It 's about female empowerment , chasing your dream , and supporting your friend . Funny , charming and fun , Bend It Like Beckham is the little film that could ... and did . Excellent . 8/10 .",1
"Note , I only saw approximately the last half of this movie , so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate , that being said , seeing what I saw wa more than enough to make me quite convinced that a one-star rating for this is enough . In short , it 's a dismal-plot slaughter of the wonderful precursor ( NL Christmas Vacation ) with Chevy Chase , only it doe n't have Chevy Chase in it , and it take place in a generic tropical island , essentially with no connection to Christmas at all . Ol ' Chevy probably did n't want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun , instead they got the screwy Cousin Eddie , who , again , wa great in the original , but in this he is just over the top , and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting . The attempt at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trump it , and considering that this is supposed to be comedy , I doubt I need to say more . This is not to be seen for it quality , for it ha none , but for it 's failing and again , how Hollywood is spilling it 's life 's blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buck . I think I 'll watch the original before the upcoming Christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence , from a lost time when motion picture were more than just high-budget , but mindless , garbage .",0
"What can possibly said about this movie other than , `` viewer beware '' . Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarette do , because this wa harmful to my eye and ear . I am rarely this unsatisfied with a `` b '' horror flick , but this movie could n't even bring a little scare to a five year old . The point of a relentless lunatic that ha a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like , like nothing can stop their maniacal rage , but in this film the resident psychopath get himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus , it 's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he 's far too stupid to be dangerous . All in all a total waste of film .",0
"This one is n't even lively enough to be fun . Something is out there , ripping people off ( off-screen ) after a spaceship crash ( off-screen ) while government executive investigates ( off-screen ) and bad actor say stupid line ( on-screen ) , including a guy who look like Jim Carrey with a hangover . The `` monster '' , when it finally is shown , look like an extra from `` Robot Monster '' , but there ai n't enough monster fu anyway . Fortunately , it 's pretty short . Skip it , unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this",0
"Gary Busey is superb in this musical biography . Great singing and excellent soundtrack . The Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than La Bamba . From reading other comment , there may be some historical inaccuracy . Regardless , it is a fun toe-tapping film , and a good introduction to Buddy Holly 's music .",1
"Jean Dujardin get Connery 's mannerism down pat : the adjusting the cuff link when entering a club a all the woman turn to admire him , the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie , the swaggering , steely gait . It 's uncanny , and you come to realise just how much of Bond in the Sixties wa Connery 's creation and not really Ian Fleming 's character . The cinematography is a nod to those early film , the movie take off From Russia With Love and Thunderball mainly . The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is , not just in term of sexism but nationalism and colonialism , and how he put nose out of joint when he is sent to Egypt . It 's not perfect - about 20 min in it seems a one-joke movie and bit of it remind one of spoof of the day , of which there were plenty . Morcecambe and Wise 's The Intelligence Men had suspect-looking men in fez 's following their hero around too , and that 's going back a bit . Unlike Sellers ' Clouseau or Baron Cohen 's Borat , Dujardin doe n't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his Connery mannerism . It doe n't do enough with the credit or a big song , and there 's no funny or serious villain , like Mike Myers ' Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban 's Naked Gun nemesis , for the hero to go up against . But the scene where OSS117 wake up in Cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three-quarters empty cinema , and the whole thing look wonderful , plus you 'll never get a chance to see Operation Kid Brother on the screen , and the woman are ace crumpet , really hot . It 's a Bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist/Ken Adam set or funny gadget routine . Throughly recommended .",1
"First , I would like to apologize for my rating of `` 1 '' ... The only reason i give this film such a high rating is that I ca n't delve into negative integer . All `` This is a spoof '' musing aside , and while I certainly have tried to give it due consideration , have left me with a certain notion , namely ; `` This is quite possibly the worst film ever made . '' On any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement ... Seriously , I tried , I 'm just a in to any indie born-for-cult-video-distribution film a the next buff , but seriously , this movie sucked rhino ball ... Honestly , if I had directed this `` film '' I would have seen it a a legitimate cause for suicide .",0
"- A newlywed couple move into the home of the husband 's dead former wife . It 's not long before the new wife begin to have the feeling that someone doe n't want her in the house . She see skull all around the house . But when the husband investigates , he ca n't find anything . Is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she wa recently discharged from ? Or , is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house ? - This is the first time that I 've watched The Screaming Skull without the assistance of the MST3K crew . And , it will in all likelihood be the last time I watch it this way . Can you say dull ? I 'm not talking ordinary dull - I 'm talking watching grass grow dull . There are great stretch of the movie where nothing happens . The screen could have gone blank and I would have gotten a much entertainment out of it . The character drone on and on with the most monotonous conversation imaginable . The Screaming Skull could probably be marketed a a sleep aide . - The actor do n't help matter much . Most of them deliver line with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play . I have n't looked it up , but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value . I wo n't even go into the script the actor are given to work with . Let 's just say that the character are given some of the most idiotic line ever uttered on film . - You 've been warned ! Either avoid this one at all cost or , at least , seek out the MST3K version .",0
"I have seen so many bad review on Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to stand for it ( or at least I 'll try ) . First of all , of course that it look dated , it wa made in the seventy with very low budget , but that 's part of it 's charm . I like contemporary film but also dig the old one for what they worth . I 'm not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movie with modern treatment and effect ; besides , almost every movie buff like old fashioned motion picture ( who doe n't like film from El Santo or Plan 9 from outer space , no matter it 's overall quality ? ) . In the aspect of pace , is just a tool for covering ( again ) it 's low cost , and I think the constant dialog are in order of a better character and situation development . Sure , Alive ha better FX , but I wo n't despise the old one just because of that , and I do n't feel quite attracted to English speaker in an event involving people from Uruguay and for me , that give a plus to Supervivientes de los Andes . It 's like , even if Canoa , from the seventy and based on a true event too , would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology , but I think I would stick to that one based on the emotion that offer regardless it 's production date . All of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time I saw it wa on TV , and nowadays I do n't think it ha lost some of it 's primal force . Of course it 's been a long time and I 've seen ton of better movie in every aspect of cinema , but that doe n't diminish it 's true value . It 's not a bad film , and I place it above Alive without hesitation . Just give it a break .",1
"This film is really bad . It maybe harsh , but it is . It really is . Poor script , every vampire cliché in the book is used , and no sympathy is given at all to the origin of the main character ... i.e . ole Dracula . There have been some truly brilliant Dracula/vampire movie in the past , but this doe n't even make it into the `` dire '' slot . Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move , add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious/surreal day-dreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a film - Dracula 2000 . I really can not find any good thing to say about this movie , a if it wa n't bad enough that it wa made in the first place , they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent ... Whats the problem with that I hear you cry ... Well , he is English , but he sound like an American trying to do an English accent . All in all you may a well say your money ( if you were thinking of buying it ) , or rent it out , watch it , and discover for yourself why it 's about a scary a the Tellytubbies . P.S . Although La La is pretty frightening !",0
"Looking backwards to that year 2002 when `` Furia '' wa made , one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today 's New Generation in Romania . The main quality of `` Furia '' stand in a very solid script , with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing , plus a cast of excellent actor . All four leading role are admirably performed , both with depth and casualness : Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu confirmed , since then , being two of our best performer today , Dorina Chiriac follows them closely , and Adrian Tuli , a non-professional ( in real life , a graveyard manager ! ) cast a Gabonu , wa a genuine revelation ! Further , Radu Muntean 's directing is skilled and expressive , creating in a very compelling style that feeling of `` a fateful night '' and inescapable destiny . One can easily pas over the few awkward and even failed moment , since time proved them to be only the uncertainty inherent to a debut , never repeated in his subsequent movie : `` Hârtia va fi albasträ '' and `` Boogie '' .",1
"One of the worst movie ever made ...

If you are waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash movie , there is nothing to tell ... a group of camper on motorcycle get lost in the wood and a bunch of people terrorize them ... or somthing to that ... whats more so an action movie than a horror ... this 'movie ' ( ? ) is of NO interest ... if someone acually like this I litterally feel for you .... Absolute Trash ... not even one of those cheap funny flick to watch go rent .. 'Plan 9 From Outerspace ' and have a ball",0
"Feeling Minnesota , directed by Steven Baigelmann , and starring Keanu Reeves , Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio : The strained relationship between two brother , Sam ( D'Onofrio ) and Jjaks ( Reeves ) , is pushed to breaking point when Jjaks arrives at Sam 's wedding and make off with the bride , Freddie ( Diaz ) , a former stripper , marrying Sam to repay a gambling debt owed to night-club owner Red ( Lindo ) . Baigelman 's writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess , full of hateful character and lacking coherence . Putting Keanu and Diaz in the same movie should at least provide some eye candy , but Baigelman even cop out on that score , grudging his actor up with little positive effect . Very poor .",0
"THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10 The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated . The first time I saw this film I thought it wa mediocre , but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing , I decided I had to rent it again . I did , and I found the film to be much more likeable . The Cell is not for everyone , but it divide it story up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dream up image and plot idea that could not be matched . The film 's script can be clunky at time , a can the acting , but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life . The Oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful , while the beautiful costume and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed . Tarsem Singh who ha also directed music video , go totally crazy with his direction and it result well . He ha major talent and this film ha a lot of potential if you give it a chance . Overall , The Cell is a powerful , disturbing and avoids being too tacky which make it a great , pleasurable watch .",1
"This movie , despite it list of B , C , and D list celebs , is a complete waste of 90 minute . The plot , with it few peak , wa very predictable . It wa so silly that I can not believe that I am taking the time to even write a review of it . Flex , to his credit , ha grown in his ability to act since playing Michael Jackson in a made for TV movie a few year ago . Tangi , on the other hand , ha regressed , a she wa more talented in her role a Felicity 's flunkie some year ago . As I sat watching this train wreck of a film , with it pitiful production and horrible sound quality , other four letter word came to my mind to qualify what I thought of this film . However , in an effort to keep my writing G Rated , I 'll simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an L . LAME ! ! !",0
"I loved this movie ! It wa all I could do not to break down into tear while watching it , but it is really very uplifting . I wa struck by the performance of Ray Liotta , but especially the talent of Tom Hulce portraying Ray 's twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event . But Tom 's character , though heartbreaking , know no self pity and is so full of hope and life . This is a great movie , do n't miss it ! !",1
"This wa the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane in . I understand that this movie wa mainly to showcase the new comer , who did pretty good for newbie , but over all , the movie wa not believable . With all of the gunfire , you would think the police would have intervened . Even the coin being a bug on Sean wa stupid . The way Sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug , wa not realistic . Looks like this movie wa slapped together fast . Poor job . Get a better writer . The count down to the end wa not in sync with anything . It took longer to fight . And what a coincidence that each time Billy wa going to blast Sean , he 'd be out of bullet . Once , I can believe , but not twice . Actually , Billy 's character wa goofy . It wa so stupid when Sean punch him out at the end . It wa like a comedy . Bad ! Bad ! Bad !",0
