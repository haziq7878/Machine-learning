"Stranded in Space ( 1972 ) MST3K version - a very not good TV movie pilot , for a never to be made series , in which an astronaut find himself trapped on Earth 's evil twin . Having a planet of identical size and mass orbiting in the same plane a the earth , but on the opposite side of the sun , is a well worn SF chestnut - the idea is over 2,000 year old , having been invented by the Ancient Greeks . In this version the Counter World is run a an Orwellian 'perfect ' society . Where , for totally inexplicable reason , everyone speaks English and drive late model American car . After escaping from his prisonlike hospital , the disruptive Earthian is chased around Not Southern California by TV and bad movie stalwart Cameron Mitchell who , like his minion , wear double breasted suit and black polo neck jumper - a stylishly evil combination which I fully intend to adopt if ever I become a totalitarian overlord . Our hero escape several time before ending up gazing at the alien world 's three moon and wondering aloud if he will ever get home - thus setting up one of those Man Alone in a Hostile World Making a new Friend Each Week but Moving on at the End of Every Episode show so beloved of the industry in the 70 and 80 ( 'The Fugitive ' , 'The Incredible Hulk ' , 'The Littlest Hobo ' etc . ) The curiously weirdest bit though wa the title sequence . Somewhere between 'Stranded in Space ' first airing ( under the title 'The Stranger ' ) in 1972 and the MST3K version in 1991 it somehow acquired some footage from the 1983 movie 'Prisoners of the Lost Universe ' . So in 1991 the opening credit for 'Stranded in Space ' run under a few shot of three people falling into a matter transmitter and vanishing . It 's a sequence that ha nothing to do - even thematically - with anything that is going to follow . Just to add to the nerdy B movie confusion , one of the actor in this nailed on footage , Kay Lenz , later appeared in a 1994 movie called 'Trapped in Space ' . Knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big point and admiring look from fellow trash movie enthusiast - if you could ever work out a way of manoeuvring the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like a total idiot ...",0
"- After their son are sentenced to life in prison , Adelle ( Debbie Reynolds ) and Helen ( Shirley Winters ) begin receiving threatening phone call because someone fell their son got off easy . The pair decides to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life . They start a dance school that is soon very successful . One of the student ha a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly fall in love . In the meantime , Helen is busy raising rabbit and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio . It 's only a mater of time before everything fall apart and the woman enter a world of madness and murder . - I ca n't help but compare What 's the Matter with Helen ? to Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ? , also starring Shelly Winters . Where that movie seemed almost restrained in it presentation of Auntie Roo 's madness , there 's nothing holding Helen back in this movie . It may take a good deal of the movie 's running time , but once she snap , Helen is one Bad Mad Mutha . You do n't want to mess with her . Winters is so delightfully demented that it wa impossible for me not to enjoy her performance . I 'm not going to spoil the movie , but the thing Helen is capable of are totally over-the-top . - As good a Winters is , Reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role a the gold-digging tap dancer . I got the impression that she thought she wa in a movie that would get her nominated for some award . This ai n't Citizen Kane ! Quit acting so serious . Hey , Debbie , do n't you realize that you 're main purpose is to be a victim of Winters ' insanity . - I just love these former-female-stars-in-the-twilight-of-their-career horror movie . What 's the Matter with Helen ? is a fun a any .",1
I love playing football and I thought this movie wa great because it contained a lot of football in it . This wa a good Hollywood/bollywood film and I am glad it won 17 award . Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so wa Archie Punjabi . Jonathon Rheyes Meyers wa great at playing the coach . Jazz ( Parminder Nagra ) love playing football but her parent want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married . When Jazz start playing for a football team secretly she meet Juliet ( Kiera Knightlety ) and Joe ( Jonathon Rhyes Meyers ) who is her coach . When her parent find out trouble strike but her dad let her play the big match on her sister Pinky ( Archie Punjabi 's ) wedding . At the end her parent realise how much she love football and let her go abroad to play .,1
"This Showtime cable film feature a talented cast and weave together several storyline involving the darker side of New York ... from the naive and innocent tourist ' nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cop on the street ... to an old friend 's betrayal , it ha it all . Well worth a look , a is it sequel .",1
"This is a film i decided to go and see because I 'm a huge fan of adult animation . I quite often find that when a film doe n't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style , it allows the film to be viewed a a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actor ability to differ his style . This film is certainly more about style than story . While i found the story interesting ( a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from film such a Blade Runner and many anime film ) , it wa a bit hard to follow at time , and did n't feel like it all came together a well a it could have . It definitely had a mixed sense of French Animation and Japanese Anime coming together . Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer . Visually this film is a treat for the eye , and in that sense a work of art . If you like adult animation , or would like to see a film that is different from most film out at the moment . I would recommend it . All i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better",1
"I happened to catch this supposed `` horror '' flick late one Friday night , I wish I 'd gone to bed ! Tell me .. Is a 3 ft tall raincoat-clad twerp on a gurly bike supposed to convey some sort of fear ? Not here , yet Mi-low is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor ( Antonio Fargas ) who is three time his size ( ? ) uh-huh . And the ending is so pitiful ... it just leaf you hanging with nothing to go on what-so-ever ! I found myself asking , `` Is that it ? ? ? '' Acting is about a good a it 'll get in a low budget film . The aforementioned Fargas delivers a decent performance ; but it is my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn maybe one of the worse actress to ever strut into Tinsel Town ! Sure , cute face , but bad acting . Rating : 1",0

"waste of 1h45 this nasty little film is one to avoid , it like a cheap badly plotted cross between saw and a few other recent film about kidnap , why the writer wrote this is obvious .. he ha no soul and did it to try and me some money . The twist were obvious , when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and did n't etc .. only good thing about it is I 've discovered 1 new actress worth watching .. peyton list , do n't watch shuttle though , there are too many better nicer film to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think le of the world . Spend your time more wisely watch good film , do some exercise , cook a nice meal .. anything but waste your time on rubbish like this",0
"I simply ca n't get over how brilliant the pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is . It 's like the movie doe n't even need additional character because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two . Lemmon had already been in several well-known film like Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau wa fresh off his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie ( another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon ) . That particular movie wa n't a great a this one because the story could n't sustain such a long running time ( I think it wa almost 2 hour ) . However , this go by at a brisk hour and a half , even though the introduction of the event leading up to Lemmon ending up at Matthau 's apartment is a tad long ( so wa this sentence ) . That 's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time . I have already written a comment about how the follow-up to this film sucked and I wo n't go deeper into that . The reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie wa made just a the innocence of American movie wa beginning to fade fast into oblivion . There are some sexual reference but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you could n't even get a `` Well , I never ... '' out of the most prudish person out there . It is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that wa probably why the sequel did n't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say quite a few f-words and that just doe n't fit them . Of course , now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this . I think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is John Fiedler . Edelman died recently . So there you have it . Simply one of the best comedy and film ever . Add : I have just learned recently that John Fiedler ha died so to all the fan of him I am deeply sorry . I did n't mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful of what I am blah blah blahing next time .",1
"Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait , I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning . First Pachelbel 's Canon brought a lump to my throat , then the sight of a Tiger Moth ( which my grandfather , my father and I have all flown ) produced a slight dampness around the eye and then Crowe 's name hooked me completely . I wa entranced by this film , Crowe 's performance ( again ) , the subject matter ( and yes , what a debt we owe ) , how various matter were addressed and dealt with , the flying sequence ( my father flew Avro Ansons , too ) , the story - and , a another contributor pointed out , Crowe 's recitation of High Flight . I wo n't spoil the film for anyone , but , separated from my wife by 4,000-odd mile , a an ex-army officer who wa deployed in a couple of war and a private pilot , I admit to cry heartily a couple of time . Buy it , rent it , download it , beg , borrow or steal it - but watch it . PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim ( in yellow training colour ) on the ground ? Looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret .",1
"Warning : This could spoil your movie . Watch it , see if you agree . To think that we a human can not learn from the past . The futuristic society portrayed glamorized what Hitler believed , obliterate a race of people ( in this case men ) for the benefit of society . It made me sick to my stomach . Also the plausibility of a Y bomb is insane . Even in war our instinct for self-preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity . We made mistake in the past ie : Japan , Hiroshima and Nagasaki in '45 but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in '63 during the Cuban Missile Crisis",0
"Some of the background detail of this story are based , very , very loosely , on real event of the era in which this wa placed . The story combine some of the detail of the famous Leopold and Loeb case along with a bit of Aimee Semple McPherson . The story begin with two mother ( Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds ) being hounded a they leave a courtroom . The crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm a their son were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime . One person in the crowd apparently slash Winters ' hand a they make their way to a waiting car . Soon after they arrive home , they begin getting threatening phone call , so Reynolds suggests they both move to the West Coast together and open a dance school . The dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parent who think their child is the next Shirley Temple . One of the parent of these spoiled kid is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with Reynolds and they begin dating . Life appears very good . But , when the threatening phone call begin again , Winters responds by flipping out -- behaving like she 's nearing a psychotic break and she retreat further and further into religion -- listening on the radio to 'Sister Alma ' almost constantly . Again and again , you see Winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad thing ! ! I wo n't say more , a it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film . In many way , this film is a lot like the Bette Davis and Joan Crawford horror film of the 1960s like `` Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? `` , `` Straight-Jacket '' and `` The Nanny '' . While none of these are exactly intellectual fare , on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun . The writing is very good and there are some nice twist near the end that make it all very exciting . Winters is great a a fragile and demented lady and Reynolds play one of the sexiest 39 year-olds I 've ever seen -- plus she can really , really dance . My only concern about all this is that some might find Winters ' hyper-religiosity in the film a bit tacky -- like a cheap attack on Christianity . At first I felt that way , but when you meet Sister Alma , she seems sincere and is not mocked , so I took Winters ' religious zeal a just a sign of craziness -- which , I assume , is all that wa intended . By the way , this film is packaged along with `` Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ? '' -- another Shelley Winters horror film from 1971 . Both are great fun ... and quite over-the-top !",1
"This is a pleasant film , even if the premise is silly . It wa sort of a guilty pleasure to watch . Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull off role in this kind of film ( another example is Joe vs. the Volcano ) . That 's what make her a star , in part . Walter Matthau , of course , had that ability , too , and he really put himself into the role , making an amusing , good-hearted Einstein . I suppose you could say they 're both good at portraying loveable character , though loveable in different way ( loveable young woman vs. loveable curmudgeon ) .",1
"Quite what the producer of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom . A group of top quality actor , in the main well cast ( with a couple of notable exception ) , who give pretty good performance . Penelope Keith is perfect a Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley a Diana . All do well with the script they were given . So much for the good . The average would include the set . Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book , although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House look remarkably like it . It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big . In the later part , the writer decided to bring the entire story back to the UK , presumably to save money , although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon . Now to the bad . The screenplay . This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find word to condemn it . Edward doe not die in the battle of Britain but survives , blinded . He make a brief appearance then commits suicide - why ? ? Loveday ha changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmer 's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear ( le emotional than Brief Encounter ) . Gus , a man besotted and passionately in love , is prepared to give up his love without complaint . Walter ( Mudge in the book ) turn from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man . Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who wo n't speak . Aunt Biddy still ha a drink problem but now without any justification . The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who ha a fear of armed soldier . Whilst Miss Mortimer 's breast are utterly delightful , I could not see how their display on several occasion moved the plot forward . The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson . The word limit prevents me from continuing the list . There is a sequel ( which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense ) and I wonder if the change were made to create the follow on story . It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book ; presumably she lost her control when the right were purchased .",0
"There must have been some interesting conversation on the set of Eagle 's Wing , with Martin Sheen straight off Apocalypse Now co-starred with the actor he replaced on Coppola 's film , Harvey Keitel . A real unloved child of a movie , dating back to the last major batch of Westerns in 1979-80 , it wa much reviled at the time for being made by a British studio and director ( conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic American western were directed by European émigrés ) , which seems a bit of an over-reaction . The plot is simplicity itself , a Martin Sheen 's inexperienced trapper find himself fighting with Sam Waterston 's nonosyllabic Kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse , the Eagle 's Wing , across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time `` before the legend began . '' Aside from Caroline Langrishe 's captive Irish governess , the supporting cast have little to do ( Stephane Audran never even get to open her mouth ) and it is a little slow , but Anthony Harvey 's film doe boast terrific Scope photography from Billy Williams and a good score from Marc Wilkinson .",1
"I got stuck in traffic ( I live in Sicily ) on the way to the theater ( at a military base ) to see Superman Returns , wa 15 minute late , and the only other movie playing wa `` See No Evil '' , there wa no poster up for it , and just a short description of the movie on the schedule ... but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out ... As soon a I saw it wa produced by WWE I just knew it wa gon na be awful . The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time , and it wa the first movie that I honestly considered walking out on , and I 've seen `` The Ringer '' ... okay , I would have walked out of that one , but I wa too busy sleeping . The death of the bad guy at the end wa pretty good , but other than that , it wa just stupid .",0
"I 've been trying to find out about this series for age ! Thank you , IMDb ! I saw this a a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind . As a 6-year old , of course , I wa particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops , which wa absolutely chilling ( I talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine , which I still have ) What I also remember , though , wa the atmosphere , which wa unusual right from the beginning - mysterious , austere , and extremely authentic . When I read the original many year later I experienced that same sensation . It 's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood . Every 'Odyssey ' I 've seen since ha been an enormous let-down . The character in this series seemed genuine , real people - ancient Greek people - and not some Hollywood star in costume . This is a real masterpiece ! But - Why is it not better known ? And why is n't it available on VHS or DVD ? I would just love to have the chance to see this again !",1
"I do n't know if this type of movie wa a cliché then a it seems to be now . Considering how many `` Bad News Bears '' film had already been released by 1980 , however , I think that this sort of movie wa already a tired idea . A former football player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair . The Chicago Bears offer him a PR job but he want to coach . At the same time , his underage nephew is picked up for armed robbery . We are told that he ha already been arrested over a dozen time before and he must now serve some hard time ... which turn out to be le than a year ! Of course , the kid is actually a good kid who only need a tough male role model in his life . The same go for all of the kid in the detention facility . Yes ... even the one locked up for attempted murder ! I 'm sure you already know what happens so I 'll try and keep the rest of this brief . Our protagonist becomes the coach of the kid ' football team . He overcomes the delinquent ' cynicism and earns their respect . His team face off against a local high school team ( yeah right ! ) and they get their butt kicked . Now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach , he demand a rematch . Will these underprivileged , scrappy kid with heart of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch ? Awful execution of the football sequence ruin any possibility of excitement in this film . `` Coach Of The Year '' should get penalized for roughing my brain . 1/10",0
"I went to see this film out of curiosity , and to settle an argument . The film is now best known from the suite of music Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film , the Troika movement even turning up in pop arrangement . The general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve note on various recording . A clerk accidentally generates a non-existent Lieutenant Kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar . The tsar is interested in this person , and rather than tell him he doe n't exist , the courtier and officer maintain the pretence that he is real . Kizhe is exiled to Siberia , recalled , promoted , married , promoted again , dy , is given a state funeral , revealed a an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the rank . I had heard conflicting story about how the clerk invented Kizhe , involving ink blot and sneeze , but I 'd heard the film wa lost , so there wa no way to find out what happens . Then the film turned up at the Barbican in London a part of their Prokofiev festival . For the record , it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two word whilst writing an order and turn Kuzhe into Kizhe . As the tsar is in a hurry to see the order , there 's no time to correct the mistake . Having gone expecting an historical curiosity , I wa pleasantly surprised . The film is very funny , and the audience , myself included , laughed continuously . Although most of it is filmed straight , set mostly in the palace , there are a few `` trick '' shot where multiple image appear on the screen . For instance , the tsar 's army is represented by a small group , repeated across the screen . Four identical guard perform perfect drill in perfect unison . Two identical servant scrub the floor . One slight drawback wa it wa very difficult to work out who everyone wa . There were two woman who might have been the tsar 's daughter , or a daughter and a servant or something else . And very few people were named . But all in all , an enjoyable film and I 'm surprised it 's not seen more often .",1
"Forest of the Damned start out a five young friend , brother & sister Emilio ( Richard Cambridge ) & Ally ( Sophie Holland ) along with Judd ( Daniel Maclagan ) , Molly ( Nicole Petty ) & Andrew ( David Hood ) , set off on a week long holiday 'in the middle of nowhere ' , their word not mine . Anyway , before they know it they 're deep in a forest & Emilio clumsily run over a woman ( Frances Da Costa ) , along with a badly injured person to add to their problem the van they 're travelling in wo n't start & they ca n't get any signal on their mobile phone . They need to find help quickly so Molly & Judd wander off in the hope of finding a house , a time go by & darkness begin to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone & that there is something nasty lurking in the wood ... This English production wa written & directed by Johannes Roberts & having looked over several other comment & review both here on the IMDb & across the internet Forest of the Damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it & other 's not , personally it did n't do much for at all . The script is credited on screen to Roberts but here on the IMDb it list Joseph London with 'additional screenplay material ' whatever that mean , the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) with your basic stranded faceless teenage victim being bumped off but us the interesting concept of fallen angel who roam the forest & kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction . Then there 's Stephen , played by the ever fantastic Tom Savini , who is never given any sort of justification for what he doe . Is he there to get victim for the angel ? If so why did he kill Andrew by bashing his head in ? The story is very loose , it never felt like a proper film . The character 's are poor , the dialogue not much better & the lack of any significant story make it hard to get into it or care about anything that 's going on . Having said that it move along at a reasonable pace & there are a couple of decent scene here . Director Johannes doe n't do anything special , it 's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at . There 's a few decent horror scene & the Tom Savini character is great whenever he 's on screen ( although why did n't he hear Judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with Molly ? ) & it 's a shame when he get killed off . There are a couple of decent gore scene here , someone ha their head bashed in , there 's a decapitation , someone get shotgun blasted , someone throat is bitten out , someone lip are bitten off & someone is ripped in half . There is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity , not that it help much . Technically Forest of the Damned is OK , it 's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye-catching . This wa shot in England & Wales & it 's quite odd to see an English setting for a very American themed backwards horror . The acting is generally pretty poor save for Savini who deserves to be in better than this . Horror author Shaun Hutson ha an embarrassing cameo at the end & prof he should stick to writing rather than acting . Forest of the Damned wa a pretty poor horror film , it seems to have fan out there so maybe I 'm missing something but it 's not a film I have much fondness for . Apart from one or two decent moment there 's not much here to recommend .",0
"I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought , despite not even having known it wa out since this is one of my favorite book of all time . As soon a I got home I raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed . While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book , the similarity end there . The character are changed ( ie Finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas Gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly ) , scene are misplaced or altogether changed ( ie . Lepper ) , many character are missing and famous lines/thought are missing . The movie doe attempt to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked but it is done in a lackluster way that make for a flat boring movie . It is the depth of character and feeling that make the book such a classic and this movie take those thing and utterly destroys them in it rewriting .",0
"I do n't know much about Tobe Hooper , or why he get his name in the title , but maybe he should n't have bothered . As another commenter mentioned , there is n't really enough horror or erotica to bring in fan of either genre . The plot is incoherent , the Sade sequence are gratuitous , and most of the acting is so-so . Englund wa doing his best with weak material , and Zoe Trilling ha a really great bottom , but neither is enough to carry this film . This one 's a tape-over . Grade : F",0
"Watching John Cassavetes film , Opening Night , I wa reminded of something that Quentin Tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting . He referred to an example of , say , if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it would n't be the end of his life but that it would affect him , and that , without a doubt , he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it wa a light comedy . `` Otherwise , '' a he said , `` what am I doing ? '' I could n't help but think of his word when watching Gena Rowland 's character , Myrtle Gordon , who for almost a whole week or so go through a very similar scenario . There is more to this in Cassavetes ' film , of course , since it 's about how the theater work around a star actress , what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character , and how one life when all one ha ( like Myrtle Gordon ) is the theater . Near the beginning of the film , after exiting a performance , Myrtle is signing autograph and one such fan named Nancy come up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to Myrtle . It 's a touching little moment , but it doe n't last a she ha to get in the car ( pouring rain and all ) . She then watch in horror a the girl , who stood right next to the car a it drove off , get hit by another car in an auto accident . She 's not sure really what happened , but then find out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit . From then on she 's sort of stunned by this even after she think it 's out of her system . At first this show in small way , like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor ( played by Cassavetes ) and ca n't seem to stand being hit - she blame it on the lack of depth in the character ( the writer : `` What do you think the play lack ? '' `` Hope , '' say Myrtle ) - but then Nancy start to show up to her , an apparition that to Myrtle is all to real , until she 's suddenly gone . Cassavetes , a in the past film , is after a search for what it mean to have emotion , to really feel about something and feel it , or the lack thereof , and how it affect others around the person . This is n't exactly new ground for Rowlands , who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in Woman Under the Influence ( in that case because of alcohol ) , nor would it be alien territory for costar Ben Gazzara , who just came off starring in Killing of a Chinese Bookie . But the actor express everything essential to their character in every scene ; Cassavetes doe n't tell them how to get from A to B in a scene , and he doe n't need to . There 's a mood in a Cassavetes film that trump the sometimes grungy camera-work . You know Myrtle , for example , should be content somehow , even if it is n't with the plot . But she 's haunted , and is unsatisfied with her character 's lack of depth and the tone of the play ( `` Aging , who go to see that ? '' she asks the playwright ) , and it start to affect those around her too . The question soon becomes though not what is the usual . A conventional dramatist would make the conflict 'Will she be able to go on stage , will the show go on ? ' This is n't important for Cassavetes , even if it 's there , a is the question 'Will she be alright ? ' Perhaps going through such a grueling play a `` The Second Woman '' could help her work out her personal demon and her losing her grip on reality ( seeing Sara and attacking her in front of total stranger , who wonder what the hell is going on ) ? Or will the play 's lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her ? The depth Rowlands make with her character are intense and harrowing , and that it 's expected doe n't mean it 's any duller than Woman Under the Influence- if anything , it 's just a good a that film at being honest about a person in this profession , and consequently the other performance are just a true , from Gazarra to Nancy played by a subtle Laura Johnson . Cassavetes answer to his own posed question are n't easy . One of the real thrill of Opening Night , along with seeing great actor performing an amazing script , is to see Cassavetes take on the theater the way he doe . We see the play performed- and it 's apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what it 's about . When we see the actor on the stage performing it , we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on ( relationship scuffling and affair and the occasional slap and domestic violence ) and the improvisation of the actor . I wondered watching how much really wa improvised , how much Cassavetes allowed for the other actor to do in the scene where Myrtle start to go loopy or , in the climax , is completely smashed . He 's on the stage , too , so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen . It 's funny , startling , chilling , and edge-of-your-seat stuff , some of the best theater-on-film scene ever put in a movie , and we see the line between actor on stage , actor on film , actor with actor , blur together wonderfully . Opening Night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness , reality and fiction , where the love is between people , and really , finally , what doe 'acting ' mean ?",1

The problem are that there are corny element , nothing very interesting happens , and it drag on a bit too long . The race is exciting but could have been much more so .",1
"I liked the understated character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually ' , and she is very good in 'Man of the Year ' . But wow . Robin Williams doe n't give that much of a performance , with a couple of minor exception this wa weak . Laura Linney may not have been miscast , but either the editing raped her character , or this wa just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson . And I think it wa Barry Levinson that got old . So many weak performance , such uneven result have to be the fault of management . Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great in supporting role . Goldblum play a sinister side with relish , and Walken 's combination of entertainer 's manager and commentator for the film is wonderful . But the story is cliché , the presentation look like it could have ( should have ) been a very good picture , and too many action are half-hearted . The pacing , story , and direction all come up weak , compared to , say 'Head Office ' ( spoof of 'Secret of My Success ' ) .",0
This film is probably the worst movie I have watched in a very long time . The acting is so wooden a door could have done a better job . The plot is laughable and shallow and the actual `` rugby '' shown is a far cry from reality . I still do n't get the `` haka '' a portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment . I am not a Kiwi but I do know that the Haka can only be performed by someone of Maori origin and not by an all-American white boy . I am assuming that this wa made for the American audience so the shallowness and `` Disney end ' '' is excusable but there wa hardly any attempt to point out the basic rule of the game apart from the prison side where the main character suddenly take charge of an American Football game and get everyone playing rugby instead . The only thing good about this film were the end credit . It would be le painful to spend ninety minute inserting toothpick into your eyeball .,0
"This is the kind of film one watch in gape-jawed , horrified silence , and yet continues to watch , mesmerized , a if watching a train wreck in slow motion . And yet , in the back of your mind , thought are churning : `` Who on EARTH green-lighted this garbage ? '' Some of the preceding user comment say thing like , `` A good way to introduce child to Laurel and Hardy '' -- an insult to child everywhere . That child would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy show a profound misunderstanding of the nature of child the world over . Others have commented on the faithfulness of the two star ' characterization of Laurel and Hardy to which I would respond : so WHAT ? One would think that the rash of movie BOMBS based on beloved series ( Rocky and Bullwinkle , Avengers , Flipper , Mod Squad , ad nauseam ) would have taught Hollywood that there are some thing that simply ca n't be recreated . The film of Laurel and Hardy are readily available on video : why bother with this ? As for F. Murray Abraham , a fine actor of stage and screen ... well , all I can say is , he must have been in trouble with the IRS . Run , do n't walk , away from the television if this trash come on !",0
"Sorry I could n't disagree more , with the last comment . frankly I thought this wa worse than Carry on Columbus , enough said . Last film for THE usually brilliant Charles Hartrey who looked out of place a the humour had move on to the Highly witty level of on the bus , film of which were being made at the same time , were frankly funnier .Barbara Windsor wa embarrassing , a character like one of your mum flirty friend who still think she 's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a Scotsman , Rab c Nesbit he ai n't . The series miraculously trundled on with duffer like Carry on Behind , and Carry on England . Carry on Dick wa n't bad , but really with this film the end of the series wa nigh , a pity because up to this film I cant think of bad film before this ?",0
"Next to the slasher film of the 1970s and 80 , one about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre . While slasher film had 'Black Christmas ' and 'Halloween ' to get the whole thing going , zombie flick had George Romero 's 'Dead ' film . And unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series , other director wanted to cash in . A lot of Italian director were especially interested , such a Lucio Fulci who brought u 'Zombie ' a year after Romero 's 'Dawn of the Dead ' , known a 'Zombi ' in Italy and some other country , and it wa there that Fulci 's film wa known a 'Zombi 2 ' . Apart from the walking dead it ha no relation to Romero 's film , but is a good film in it 's own right . It wa a big success in Europe and 9 year later a sequel wa born . Pros : Lots of beautiful , lush scenery . Awesome score . The acting is n't exactly good , but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience . After kind of a slow start , the pace move along like that of an action flick . Plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lover . Good job on the make-up effect . Lots of blood and some decent gore . Cons : Virtually plot le . Nothing you have n't already seen before . Blatantly rip off some thing from the first couple of 'Return of the Living Dead ' film . Cardboard character . Has n't aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music ( Not that I 'm saying all rock music of that period is bad ) , clothing , and overall feel of the movie . Final thought : First of all , this is not a true sequel to Fulci 's cult classic . In fact , I do n't know if it wa ever meant to pick up where that film left off . For those that do n't know , Fulci wa ill during production and ended up leaving and wa replaced with Bruno Mattei . Mattei 's film are pretty laughable , but like this film many are good campy fun . And that 's all this film really is , just something to watch for fun . My rating : 3.5/5 ( So-bad-it's-good rating ) 2/5 ( Serious rating )",0
"This is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan and this is the sickest , in my opinion . A bunch of guy torture a girl for several day before finally killing her . And at this point , I will say that these film are NOT real ! They are faked horror film which try to be a realistic a possible . The scene are sickening but also unrealistic in many case . For example , when they kick the girl in the floor , we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl ! And how stupid this look ! The sound effect are also unrealistic and do n't make sense . Other scene include animal intestine thrown on the girl , the girl exposed to loud noise for many hour , the ripping off of fingernail , worm placed on the wound in the girl 's body , the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that . Very sick and mean spirited film and ha absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant . This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig , although it is not a bloody a the next part , Flowers of Flesh and Blood , which try to be a shocking a possible . Guinea Pig : Devil 's Experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I 've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is . This is still ( of course ) faked s ( n/t ) uff , the only difference to genuine `` snuff film '' is that no one dy or hurt for real in this film . I can not recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s * * * * y and repulsive . They who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it . I watched this a a curiosity ( a the other part in the series ) and now I know how insignificant trash these are . They work only in shock level and that 's not too valuable cinematic achievement . Devil 's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I 've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole ( Guinea Pig 4 ) is perhaps the most disgusting film I 've seen . So these are pretty extreme in my book , but that 's all they are .",0
"Although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film , the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb . Yaara , studying at Princeton , return to her native Israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend , Talia . Because Yaara practically lived with her friend 's parent after the death of her own mother , she ha lost her adoptive sister . And because Yaara , blind from birth , ha been guided and guarded by Talia , her friend 's suicide is a unbearable a it is inexplicable . Inevitably , the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death . Though without sight , she ha insight . Though she can not see , she is able to find what is out of sight than the `` normal '' people around her . The film thus becomes an absorbing mystery a Yaara scour for clue in memory of her relationship with Talia , in her adoptive family 's house , in tape , diary , and people in Talia 's past and present . Told from Yara 's point of view , the film is also seen from her point of view , a she visualizes what she hears , belief , and imago . The solution to the mystery is rather conventional , but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare , that the pat moment is easily forgiven . The truth emerge gradually yet inexorably , clarifying not only Talia 's life , but also her relationship with Yaara . Tali Sharon , a Yaara , us her mobile face and voice effectively , and is utterly believable a both the adult and teenage girl . We accept fully her ability by the film 's end to find her place in the world more confidently . Noteworthy is the precision by which place and action are repeated with small but significant variation that never become tedious , the dead-on acting by the minor character , and the interesting decision to represent Talia only a a teenager . I will quibble with Yaara 's final declaration a stand with Gadi , Talia 's last boyfriend , at a cliff 's edge , but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her word will be recalled .",1
"`` True '' story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begin polluting the water . Amusing , though not really good , monster film ha lot of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way . Give it point for giving u a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scene but take some away in that it look like a non threatening puppy . An amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind . ( My one complaint is that the print used on the Elvira release is so poor that it look like a well worn video tape copy that wa past it prime 20 year ago . )",0
"Even if you could get past the idea that these boring character personally witnessed every Significant Moment of the 1960s ( ok , so Katie did n't join the Manson Family , and nobody died at Altamont ) , this movie wa still unbelievably awful . I got the impression that the `` writer '' just locked themselves in a room and watched `` Forrest Gump , '' `` The Wonder Years , '' and Oliver Stone 's 60 film over and over again and called it research . A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode `` head spinning '' . He wa right .",0
"I first saw this film over 25 year ago on British TV and have only just caught up with it again last week on a DVD copy bought off ebay . I had remembered the musical sequence , the colour and the gorgeous fashion plate pose and clothes but the plot is weaker than the earlier Anna Neagle/Michael Wilding film Spring in Park Lane and Maytime doe n't stand up so well to the passage of the year . But Michael Wilding is a joy in the film , charming , funny , debonair , appears to be having great fun and on top of his form . Worth watching for him alone . Anna Neagle appears a little matronly beside him , and a little too old for the part she play but by the end of the 1940 's their film partnership wa well established with the cinema going public . Spring in Park Lane had been a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker . In his autobiography Wilding wrote at length of his great regard for Herbert Wilcox the director and instigator of this London series of film .",1
"I saw the MST3K version of `` Deathstalker III '' and loved the movie so much -- even `` unmystied '' -- that I decided to watch the entire series of `` Deathstalker '' film . I bought I and II and settled down for a laugh . Nothing about `` Deathstalker I '' wa funny on any level and when the credit rolled I wa embarrassed and regretful that I had bought it ! Too much ugliness and nudity . I guess either `` DS 3 '' wa a much cleaner production or MST3K really edited a lot because I expected something similar , i.e . stupid and carefree and simple . I wa wrong . Even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money . I did n't even open `` DS 2 '' a I will return it tomorrow . Now I 'll probably just throw away this DVD a I ca n't return it and no one want it -- including myself ! So really , do n't bother with this one . Even the nudity ( lot of it , btw ) is uninspiring and icky .",0
"I have a question for the writer and producer of `` Prozac Nation '' : What is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America ? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci a Liz Wurtzel , the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential a a Harvard student and a a writer . But this is not a story of success , only one of self-destruction a we watch Liz bring misery into the life everyone who come in contact with her . The film examines divorce , family dysfunction , drug , alcohol , and prescription medication a possible reason for Liz 's unhappiness . But none of those superficial explanation are satisfactory . At some point in the film , it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz need to take responsibility for her life and her problem . No light wa shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in `` The United States of Depression . '' In the story , Liz had a caring therapist ( Anne Heche ) , a caring roommate ( Michele Williams ) , a caring boyfriend ( Jason Biggs ) , and a troubled but caring parent ( Jessica Lange ) . In a key scene in the film , Liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break-up of the space shuttle Challenger . Instead of equating Challenger with Liz 's life , the film should have used the image a a starting point for her healing and recovery . This film reminded me of a generic made-for-cable `` victim '' film on the Lifetime network . An excellent cast wa wasted , especially in the earnest performance of Christina Ricci . The real-life Elizabeth Wurtzel obviously found within herself the resource to cope with her depression and become a successful author . It is unfortunate that the film could not offer u even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit .",0
"Ich will danke Herr Hacke für den Filme . Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut . Enschuldigen Sie . First of all , i did n't know how diverse the sound of Istanbul , inspite i live in Turkey.Faith Akin and Alexander Hacke have made a different approach for Turkish music.Narrating , performing , seeing Istanbul and Istanbul Music from a foreigner aspect had given the real meaning of the music itself . In this movie I had found out how different our ( Turkish ) culture is , how interesting our performer are , and how much respect they deserve . Unfortunately no one have been able to serve this kind of documentary before .",1
"I saw this movie again a an assignment for my management class . Were to mainly comment on the different management style and idea on quality ( of the product ) . I did rent this one back in the eighty and I remember it to be good ( but not great ) movie . I 've always liked Michael Keaton 's style and delivery . He wa a perfect fit for the movie . I am surprised to see some of the low rating for this movie . I grant you yes it 's no Oscar winner but it doe have decent comedic value . It 's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce . I also find some of those that felt this wa an inaccurate film on cultural and business difference . I beg to differ . I grant you again that there are a lot of generality and dramatization but then again this is Hollywood film not a documentary . From what I 've read about difference between Automakers on both side of the Pacific at that time many of the principle idea were accurate for the time . Some of the basic difference were that Japanese worker made to feel a part of the company a a whole . Teamwork wa emphasized . They perhaps made the company above all else . Where American worker had more of a management verse labor type of relationship . The individual wa more important than the company . I 'll probably get some hate email over that comment I 'm sure . Another difference wa how quality wa viewed and whose responsibility it wa to fix . In many Japanese plant defect or problem are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered . Rather a one character in the movie put it `` it wa the dealer ( meaning car dealer ) problem '' . Many of these thing are probably dated but I 'm sure some are still around a many US car maker are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese . If one is more interested in the subject of American , European and Japanese automaker I can recommend a book that study this subject in more detail and wa done around the same time period . The book is called `` The machine that changed the world '' by James Womack , Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos . It 's about a study of automaker during and before the time period that this movie cover . Parts are bit dry but I think you 'll find that it back up much the movie also .",1
"Near the beginning , after it 's been established that outlaw John Dillinger ( Warren Oates ) , is an egomaniacal rapist , another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the FBI . Second-in-command Melvin Purvis ( Ben Johnson ) , survey the situation , stick a lighted cigar in his mouth , pick up two loaded .45-caliber automatic , and stalk off into the distant house alone . Bang , bang , bang . Purvis emerges alone from the house , carrying the female hostage , the miscreant dead . All in long shot . If you 're enthralled by story like Red Riding Hood , this should have considerable appeal . Oh , it 's a exciting a it is mindless . Pretty Boy Floyd meet his demise dramatically . Multiple violation of the civic code . Plenty of shoot out with Tommy gun and pistol . Blood all over . As history , it stink . Few remember Melvin Purvis a an FBI hero , partly , I would guess , because of his name . Melvin PURVIS ? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover , who fired Melvin Purvis because he wa a rival in the quest for public attention though . The picture wa written and directed by John Milius . He 's the guy who had it written into his contract that , should any animal be shot and killed in the course of one of his production , he should be the designated shooter . Milius is the guy , a compleat gun freak , who had Teddy Roosevelt 's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war shouting quotation from Henry V -- `` Saint Crispin 's Day '' and all that .

"This is , without a doubt , one of my favorite Columbo episode ever . The acting is very well done , the music is very catchy , the script is ingenious , and the direction is fabulous . Peter Falk , who act brilliantly in every Columbo episode , act particularly well in this episode . Also , great performance from Stephen Caffrey , Gary Hershberger , Alan Fudge and Robert Culp . The ending is absolutely brilliant and I love the way Columbo describes it . This is a Columbo movie that WO N'T , go amiss .",1

"I like Wes Studi & especially Adam Beach , but whoa is this movie a load of pretentiousness . Ponderously slow . Overly cryptic to the point of obfuscation , not because the plot warrant it but because there is almost no plot . Even le in the way of characterization . This is almost like one of those creaky old Charlie Chan mystery ( the cheaper Monogram studio version ) with lot of red herring & oddball character ( like the old ex-senator with the checkered past who is now a recluse ) & load of people getting killed over objets d'art that you would n't look twice at in the mall . Great scenery , though . Pretty hair on the redhead , too , although I never did figure out what she wa doing in this at all . Neither could my wife . Sheesh , at least the old B-movies had the decency to be short .",0
"Olivier Assayas ' film star Asia Argento a a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen . Madsen is a business man who 's in financial trouble . In desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle , a company from the Far East . As Madsen begin his move away from his company Asia Argento return to his life . The pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favor for Madsen ( with said Golden Eagle ) . Once Argento enters the film the film follows her a we see the tangled web she 's woven and how the complication spin dangerously and violently out of control . I 'm not a fan . Actually I wa quite bored a the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which I kept wondering what the point wa other than to provide a meaty role for Argento . Argento , daughter of director Dario Argento and a director in her own right , is a unique actress . At time stunningly good , she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being . Sometimes it work and sometimes it doe n't . I do n't think it completely work here mostly because the script is too `` complicated '' to support it . I did n't care what wa going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way ( she seemed more nut job than anything else ) . I 'm not blaming the actor but writer/director Assayas who ha once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of part actor love to tackle , but which leave audience scratching their head because they they do n't really work . If you must try it on cable",0
"Is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement ? To a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem a intimidating a joining a real circus . Even though such people normally outsource their brain to Hollywood for these important issue , the teaching of Hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing . Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism . Here you 'll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk . You 'll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful argument of fear . You 'll learn how to stop any human activity that doe not interest you by labeling it a the gateway to planetary Armageddon . In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you 'll also learn how to shrug off accusation that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are . You 'll be able to use a much energy a Al Gore yet while having people treat you a if you were Amish . In the second season wa even more useful a we were able to visit other Hollywood Gods , holy be thy name , and audit - i.e . judge - their lifestyle . NOTE : This is the only time it 's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sort of expensive and trendy eco-toys so that they can wag their finger in other people 's face . What doe Ed have in store for u in season three ? Maybe he 'll teach u how to be judgmental while sleeping !",0
"Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald ( Ryan Gosling ) , a disaffected teenager who ha apparently murdered a severely retarded peer , the brother of a girl he wa dating . The issue is not whether he did it or not  Leland admits to it , straight away  but rather , why . Interestingly , rather than a crime drama , Leland becomes a character story , examining why people do what they do  not necessarily the easiest ground to till . And Leland feature the required indie group of screwed-up people . Aside from the title character , there 's also Pearl ( Don Cheadle ) , who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who see straight off that Leland is different . We meet Leland 's distant and egotistical father ( Kevin Spacey in an extended cameo ) , who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did . But the real flavoring come out when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards , the family of the retarded child . First , there 's Leland 's girlfriend Becky ( Jena Malone ) , a drug addict who ca n't keep herself clean ; her sister Julie ( Michelle Williams ) , perhaps the most normal person in the film , who merely seek to get away from it all ; and Allen Harris ( Chris Klein ) , a young man who life with the Pollards and is Julie 's boyfriend . Lastly , there 's Ryan ( Michael Welch ) , whom all the others call goofball , who can not communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings . Leland focus primarily on it eponymous protagonist , but the movie slowly  occasionally too slowly  burrow into everyone 's life , asking the chief question , why do people do what they do ? While Leland discus it openly in a journal Pearl allows him to keep , examining notion of good and bad and personal responsibility , all the character at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another 's , perhaps the most basic choice any human can make . And the movie take a good look at what go into those choice , and the consequence of them . In the beginning of the film , you 're simply struck by the depth of the cast . Spacey . Cheadle . Gosling . Michelle Williams . Even Chris Klein  these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in , and putting them all together make for a heady brew . For a space in the middle the film seems to stall , sputtering along a it unfolds ; it look for a while a if it will be content merely to ask question and not supply any answer . But when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie start to hit it stride and come together , Leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of film-making . Leland 's explanation of the world and his action , in the end , bring every story into focus , and all the investment you 've made in the film pay off . Saying Ryan Gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice . At this point in his career it 's redundant  this is one of the finest young actor working today , and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thought-provoking protagonist . Gosling employ such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting ; he ha to face off most of the film opposite Don Cheadle , whom we know ha the good , and he not only hold his own , he elevates Cheadle 's game a well . Cheadle himself is in top notch form , imbuing Pearl with a fully-rounded humanity  for good and bad . Spacey is kind of one-note , but that 's the character , and he handle it excellently . I wa surprised by Chris Klein ; with this level of acting , I thought he would be buried in the mix , but he give probably the turn of his career so far . Terrific work all around . Leland is a bit of a downer , and again , it 's draggy in spot . But it finish strongly and leaf a lasting impact on the viewer ( on this one , anyway ) . There 's also a subtle commentary on racism in the film ( in Leland 's first day in juvenile hall class , he 's the only white person in the room ) that , like much of the movie , is very effectively handled . I would n't go so far a to call this required viewing  some might find it too slow or too odd  but I thought it wa one of the better film I 've seen in a while , far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there . I 'd recommend it  with the above caveat  if for no other reason than to watch Gosling further perfect his craft .",1
"then the second half of this movie is hard to follow . I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion , but the film skipped many year forward with the French ruling Spain . The movie doe little to fill you in on what happened , and I do n't remember much about it . So , the movie get confusing then . The movie begin when Ines , daughter of a rich merchant , is accused of Judiasm by the church , specifically Father Lorenzo . She is put to the Question and forced to confess . Even her family 's wealth can not buy her out of prison . Her father force Lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp , in hope of getting Ines released . All it doe is give a reason for the church to condemn Lorenzo , who run off to France . Then , the movie skip many year , and the French Revolution is in full force . Ines is released from prison . It wa very good make up work to make Natalie Portman look that tore up . She find her family dead and seek Goya for her help . She tell him she had a child in prison . Goya set up a meeting between her and Lorenzo , whom is now with the French and in power . He is the father . Goya see the daughter and tell Lorenzo , whom decides it 's best to send her off to America , so no one will find out . But before his plan get carried out , the British join the Spainish , and Spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted . That part is not well told in the film . It 's like the film show this to happen in a day . FINAL VERDICT : The movie is good until it skip many year in time after the Inquistion , then the movie expects you to understand what is going on . It just got too confusing to me then .",0
VHS - I have watched this over and over and LOVED every minute of it so much so I have now ordered the DVD I only wished the film could have lasted longer . I never worry about what other people think I prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comment and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever . Make up your own mind and do n't let others put you off ! I have all Jane Austen 's BBC series but this is my FAVOURITE . I see there is to be a NEW Northanger Abbey released in 2007 which I will buy when it come out but it will not stop me watching Northanger Abbey released in the 80 's .,1
"This awful effort just go to show what happens when you not only use computer to generate the effect , but also let them devise the plot and write the script . Someone somewhere ha obviously come up with a new bit of software that asks a few question then churn out four hour of loosely connected clichés , lousy dialogue and a collection of stock character that you end up wishing had all drowned in the first five minute . Tom Courtney took the prize for worst performance . Saying that he wa wooden would be an insult to tree . It 's hard to fault Robert Carlyle in almost anything he doe , but the odds were stacked against even him in this one , especially since he wa for some unaccountable reason required to adopt a gor ' blimey London accent .

"I have always loved The Muppets . Though most child 's entertainment then wa n't that likable , The Muppet 's wa . The Muppet 's are very , very funny . They are probably the most likable child 's character ever . Not only did The Muppets have their own show . They also have starred in many film . from The Muppet 's Christmas carol to The Muppet 's treasure Island . The first Muppet 's movie , The Muppet movie , wa also , like the show and the other film , excellent . The Muppet movie is about how they all got started . Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp . Until one day a movie executive tell him that there are audition for frog in Hollywood . So Kermit take off for Hollywood . Along the way he run into lot of people such a Fozzie Bear , Gonzo the great , and Miss Piggy . Also , an evil man is trying to capture Kermit . All of the Muppet film are highly enjoyable . I mean they are all very funny . This film ha many film appearance . Such a Steve Martin , Mel Brooks , Elliot Gould , Carol Kane , Richard Pryor , and Orson Welles . The Muppet film are all very enjoyable . I hear that Jason Segel is going to star in one soon . I ca n't wait to see it .",1
"Stan Laurel regarded PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP a the first true ' L & H film . THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS wa the first 'official ' L & H film , but this wa the one where Stan completely resigned himself not only to performing ( he had signed on with the Hal Roach Studios a a director and 'gag-man ' , before certain situation - among them Oliver Hardy 's accident with a leg of lamb leading to Stan having to replace him ; and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife , Lois - brought about his historic return to performing , a well a writing , directing , editing and involvement in other area of production ) , but also realised the fact that he wa part of a team that worked well together . This , therefore , is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy . It is also a surprisingly funny little silent film ; rather different from what Laurel & Hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today . The character of 'Stan & Ollie do not appear - Scottish Stan Laurel play the nephew of Oliver Hardy , a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange-looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girl . There are some very funny moment in this well-made , charming little movie , and the performance of these two Kings of Comedy are spot-on - watch Stan 's little 'scissor-kick ' and smile that say , `` Well waddaya know ? '' when he see girl , or the hair-ruffling scene at the airport , for instance . Hilarious . Watch this film if you can , with backing music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra ( available on the VVL video release ) which enhances the 1920s feel and is very , very pleasant to listen to . It 's a brilliant and underrated little film , which is why I said it wa 'surprisingly ' funny .",1
"Well - when the cameo appearance of Jason Miller ( looking even more eroded than he did in Exorcist IV ) is the high point of a picture , what 've you got ? It 's a little bit country , a little bit rock n ' roll : mix two drunk with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog-dried mummy ( have you figured that one out yet - DRIED in a bog ? ) in the basement , Christopher Walken with a bad dye job , and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they 'd developed her . I understand - sort of - that they 're going back to visit her relative . After that .... Problem : There are several interesting flashback to what I must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing ( I think ) . This is never connected to anything . Problem : What do we need the grandmother for ? Now , the grandmother could be interesting . She speaks Gaelic , or Celtic , or something . Maybe you can make something of her . The best they can do is that she 's got a tobacco habit . That 's all . Problem : They cast a real shifty character a the husband . Is he type-cast ( will he sell his wife to the devil ? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her ) or is he cast against type ( after all , he ha a good haircut and nice clothes ) ? He drink , he hesitates . He 's not a bad guy . Not a good one . But dislikable . Why did n't they DO something with him ? No problem : an old boyfriend show up . The husband knock him down . He come back to knock down the husband . ( It get pretty stupid , but at least THAT character ha motivation . ) NOW - she 's an alcoholic , he 's an alcoholic ; he might only have married her for her money . The grandmother is locked in the bedroom . The blind uncle take our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch ( are you following this ? ) who may come to life . In fact , you KNOW she 'll come to life , the music swell . A little girl life in the house , take tea to the grandmother ( unlocks the door to do so ) and provides granny with cigarette . Periodically , granny get out . But nothing happens . Husband and wife lose the kid in the house , subsequently lose their bedroom . Uncle get his throat cut in the basement . The leading lady ha nose-bleeds . The husband drink . They both drink . In the face of all of this , the awful truth alluded to in the first over-voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady wa twelve year old . In spite of all these dangling-thread ingredient , nobody managed to get a story on the screen . No bridge between situation , no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror , just long slow scene that go nowhere . ; nbody , really , to care about - and they had place to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunk , the grandmother who might be locked up because she 's a monster , but no , her worst fault is smoking . She 's got great hair , good makeup . In short , no plot . Just a little random ( predictable ) violence in a dark library , with the rain gushing in , and the sound track cuing u in . You need more than a few drunk and Christopher Walken to make a movie . The production value were good . Oh . Nice scenery , good wardrobe . The cameraman , at least , knew what he wa doing . I bought it . Poor me .",0
"I 'm not great at writing review , so I 'll just spout my opinion ... I loved this series at first . The adventure , the action , the comedy , the drama ... I thought it wa all brilliant . Anderson , Tapping , Shanks , Judge , Davis ... I loved them all . Davis , it seemed , wa the fifth-most important person in the cast . Not a big deal . But when his character ( General Hammond ) left at the end of the seventh season , and Anderson 's character ( Colonel O'Neill ) moved from the field to the office , the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff . I do n't know whether it 's because Hammond wa more important that I realized or what , but for some reason , after the seventh season , the series turned to * * * * . The first seven season , though , were awesome . The movie Stargate seemed mediocre the first time I saw it , but it turned out to be , even if this wa n't the original intention , a brilliant setup to the series . I recommend that you watch the movie first , then watch the first season of the TV series , then watch the movie again ( you 'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around , believe me ) , and then watch the rest of the TV series . The last three season of the series are n't nearly a good a the first seven , but that doe n't mean they are n't good . It just mean they 're a letdown if you 've gotten spoiled by the first seven season . After you have finished this series , be sure to watch the spin off series , Stargate : Atlantis . It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series . EDIT on 7-18-08 : I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few week ago . It is a great loss .",1
"OK , anyone who could honestly say that this movie wa Great or even Good is either delusional or know the Director , Writer and Producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film . I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it wa Horrible . I 'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big film and even independent and this movie bored me to tear . The reason I 'm being so harsh is because this film wa clearly a different take on `` Of Mice and Men '' and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story . In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to take a classic book and film `` Of Mice and Men '' and destroy it with a new spin bug me so much . The actor , the accent , the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing wa dismal . I mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure it just a good or better than the original to make the new spin justified . Did not like this movie at all .",0
"Man , this movie sucked big time ! I did n't even manage to see the hole thing ( my girlfriend did though ) . Really bad acting , computer animation so bad you just laugh ( woman to werewolf ) , strange clip , the list go on and on . Do n't know if it just me or doe this movie remind you of a porn movie ? And I do n't mean all the naked lady ... It 's something about the light or something ... This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked woman , but not because it 's an original movie white a nice plot twist . My final word are : Do n't see it ! It 's not worth the time . If you wan na see it because the nakedness there 's lot of better one to see !",0
"I loved Long Way Round and wa n't even aware of Race to Dakar until i saw it on the shelf of my local supermarket . I bought it and after a slightly 'hmm will this be a good ' first episode i decided that it wa . Charlie Boorman wa great a were the other member of the crew . Great to see him with Ewan again . There wa a fair bit of swearing in it but that did n't bother me . As for their being no mention of it on the package . Thats more to do with the silly Excempt from Classification certificate that the BBFC have . They should have given it a 15 just for the language alone . Highly recommended series , i want more ! !",1
"It could n't . From the cutting dialogue to the super special effect this film wa a joy to behold throughout . The immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic , the affinity for the character that is built up at the base level before the real action heat up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable film around . Up against a long list of film that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitor from another planet , The Thing come out on top and laughing . Who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effect ? Special effect that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated image that we get to see today . I for one found some of the most enjoyable aspect of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew , and the way that they all had some distinctive character trait . This wa n't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick . This film had feeling . Emotion . I truly ca n't recommend this film highly enough . I have yet to see anything in it 's class that come anywhere near to matching , let alone bettering , the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema .",1
"On the heel of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic , concerning the life of teenager a they headed into adulthood , George Lucas ' American Graffiti , we have Cooley High . An adaptation of sort by one Eric Monte , co creator of the popular 1970 's CBS sitcom Good Times . Cooley High wa , and is , viewed a a black version of American Graffiti.Instead of central California , a in American Graffiti , we have the black slum of Chicago 's Cabrini Green a the backdrop for the story here . Instead of America in 1962 Cooley High is situated in 1964.The movie star Welcome Back Kotter 's , Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman a the movie main protagonist and it ' main character . It ha Garrett Morris playing the principal who try to keep Jacobs ' and Turman 's character , named Coceise and Preach , out of trouble a great deal of the time . You know , I would like to say that Cooley High is a worthy comparison piece to American Graffiti or that it is a great film on it ' own but I ca n't . The problem lie with the fact that the producer of the film could n't or would n't hide the sad underside of black life in America.Having the film in the Cabrini Green part of Chicago doe n't help thing . Neither doe the crass gross attempt at humor here . When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he find his little brother ha thrown down a toilet . When the gang visit the Chicago Zoo , one of the gang named Pooter , ha manure thrown on him by an ape . When the Turman 's character , Preach , is being chased by two hoodlum in the school hangout ( A dirty and depressing place to eat food in much le meet people at ) , he open the door of the girl ' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself a he escape through the window of the same bathroom ! The high school , the home of the character , the bathroom , just about everywhere in the film display the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty . If that wa n't enough there wa the rough display of humor in the film . The use of violence and profanity in the film . Cooley High may be an coming of age film , but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate American Graffiti so much . Motown Records had a hand in making the film . The company 's music wa part of the film 's soundtrack . But even here you get a sense of same old same old a one ha heard these song before a million time over . Not that they were n't great song within themselves but black music , of that time period wa more than just Motown.Especially in Chicago . The song nearing the end of the movie , by the Spinners ' G.C . Cameron , wa not all that impressive . There have been better Motown ballad that have been done , by better Motown artist than Cameron without question . The last part of the film showing where the character went to pay homage to the film Cooley High aimed to be , American Graffiti . It show that Preach , an intelligent but underachieving student went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer . Eric Monte may have patterned himself a Turman 's character . The last shot of film show 's Preach running away from Coceise 's funeral , held on a dark rainy afternoon , and all the bleakness that Cooley High came to represent . Eric Monte , through Preach and that final scene , had one little lesson for all of u when watching Cooley High and for the love of the past . Do n't look back .",0
"Wow . The only people reviewing this positively are the Carpenter apologist . I know a lot of those . The guy that 'll watch John Carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror . This `` movie '' is utter crap . It look and sound like a porno ( good lord , the soundtrack is awful ... ) , and ha sub-par porn acting , which is shocking , because normally Ron Perlman is really a very good actor . I honestly have no idea what Carpenter wa thinking when making this . Most likely `` Beans , bean , bean .. '' until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day ... They say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever , when they could have had a very interesting central theme ( how do religious zealot anti-abortionists feel when it 's the devil 's baby ? ) but instead they chose to have Ron Perlman and his terribly acted kid kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctor try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl . Not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed . It 's just awful . Like , Plan 9 From Outerspace awful . Like , good god please would somebody turn it off before I soil myself awful . Try watching this and The Thing in the same day and your mind will implode .",0
"Van damme ha done some great film over the year and this one hit a big ten in my book . From the setting of Mexico to the five star fight scene , this movie wa amazing . The film is all about border patrol officer protecting there territory which is the border of Mexico . Ex navy seal are smuggling drug out of Mexico into the united state of America ( USA ) , Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performance a the cop and the villain . Although this film wa n't a good a until death but it still gave the action , acting and the film a five star look . I always look forward to these b grade action film and they keep getting better . keep them coming van damme . Watch this film if you enjoyed film like - Until death , The hard corp and second in command .",1
"I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm so glad now that I have . It 's truly a wonderful film . The actor are superb , the writing is fresh and real , the whole thing wa just spot-on . I love James McAvoy in this , and I ca n't wait to see him in `` The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe '' movie this December . Romola Garai is wonderful too . Be sure to check her out in `` I Capture the Castle '' or `` Nicholas Nickleby , '' two of my favorite film . Overall , I think I liked this movie because it did n't chicken out . It 's a difficult subject matter to tell a story about , in that you 're very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overly-sentimental-sugary-sweet love fest . But they avoided doing that completely , and instead made a film that 's real , honest , and touching , yes , but never over-the-top . Very well done . Amazingly well done . Go out and see it , and you 'll know exactly what I mean .",1
"A River Runs Through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brother , Norman and Paul , ( Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer ) whose Reverend father ( Tom Skerritt ) is a strict man whose two passion are his faith and fly fishing , - and , for him and his son , there is a fine line between the two . This story describes the slow progression of the brother ' life and how their life separate on two different path . It is a touching movie narrated by the director , Robert Redford , playing the elderly Norman and reflecting on time long gone and people long dead . Certain theme recur in the movie , such a memory , death , eternity , and dream . Most of these theme revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul . He is a capable , charming , and brave man , but ha his fatal flaw . The closing line sum up the `` point '' of the movie : `` Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon , all existence fade to a being with my soul and memory and the sound of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise . Eventually , all thing merge into one , and a river run through it . The river wa cut by the world 's great flood and run over rock from the basement of time . On some of those rock are timeless raindrop . Under the rock are the word , and some of the word are theirs . I am haunted by water . ''",1
"4 out of 10 . This film wa neither funny a a whole nor wa it even worthing investing any kind of emotion into the character . Eugene Levy is probably the most funny .... The rest of the cast do their job , but the story never really get very deep and there are a lot of hole in the plot that never get filled . This just wa n't very much fun , despite being funny at time .",0
"What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth who specialized in slippery , shifting alliance did n't get hold of this concept first . He could have helped bring out the real potential , especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop . As the movie stand , it 's pretty much of a mess ( a asserted by reviewer Chipe ) . The main problem are with the direction , cheap budget , and poor script . The strength lie in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept -- character pulled in different direction by conflicting force . What wa needed wa someone with vision enough to pull together the positive element by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole , instead of the sprawling , awkward mess that it is , ( try to figure out the motivation and interplay if you can ) . Also , a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shot , and gotten the location out of the all-too-obvious LA outskirt . The real shame lie in a waste of an excellent cast -- Hayden , Taylor ( before his teeth were capped ) , Dehner , Reeves , along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely death . Few film illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this lowly obscure Western , which , in the right hand , could have been so much more .",0
"But I doubt many were running to see this movie . Or `` Some Came Running Out Of The Cinema '' . Okay , that 's a bit harsh . The film start in an unintentionally comical way : Frankie-boy come back to his hometown after many year ( this already smell of clichés ) and the whole town is shaken by his arrival : he is talked about , everyone want to talk to him , and every woman he meet flirt with him like there 's no tomorrow - even his niece hint that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with Frankie-boy a little longer ! Even his pretty niece want a piece of him ! Sounds like one of those laughable `` Mike Hammer '' episode where EVERY single female want Stacey Keach . And , like Stacey Keach , Frankie-boy is anything but a good-looking woman 's wet dream . In real life , someone like Sinatra ( without the fame ) would n't get within 100 m of someone a beautiful a MacLaine . But in this Hollywood movie it 's the other way around : MacLaine is absolutely nut about Frankie-boy , but HE could n't care le ! Sinatra play his `` cool '' shtick much too often in his movie , and it is rarely credible . Dean Martin is kind of miscast ; he is n't miscast a a card-player , but rather because of the accent which simply doe n't suit him . MacLaine is charming a ever , but she play a caricature - and this reliance on caricature is one of the basic problem with the film . The main character are all some sort of stereotype out of bad or seen-it-all-before movie and cheap novel ; Frankie is the `` cool cat '' who come back to town to get all the woman , and he could n't care le about his writing ( which , predictably , eventually garner recognition ) ; Martin is a sleazy but friendly card-player ; MacLaine is the dumb , but very likable bimbo ; Frankie 's blond love-interest is a snotty literary expert ; Frankie 's brother is the successful guy who married into his wife 's business and ha a lousy marriage ; and so on . Clichés . The story contains a couple of coincidence which are a little too far-fetched for my taste : Frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale ; his niece just happens to be meter away from her daddy when the latter kiss his secretary for the FIRST time ; and then there is the awful , stupid ending . In it , a drunk guy bent on killing Frankie-boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all place ! The place is utterly crowded , with the typical noise and chaos - plus it 's happening in the evening - and yet the guy somehow find Frankie ( in spite of being drunk a a doorknob ) and shoot at him . But guess who he kill ? MacLaine . She jump in front of the bullet to save Frankie : a cliché which comic-book writer might cringe at . This utterly pathetic , over-dramatic , and annoying ending certainly can not please any , even semi-intelligent , viewer . And this happens on the same day that MacLaine and Sinatra got married ! The writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novel his whole life - how else is the writing of this movie to be explained ? There is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with Frankie & Martin vs. some cliché caricature out of the writer 's `` vivid '' imagination . ( It wa like a damn Western suddenly . ) Another dumb thing is the way Sinatra wa crazy about the boring snotty-nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored MacLaine . As the movie progress we find out that Sinatra find MacLaine to be too dumb for him , just a the blond bimbo find Sinatra to be too low-class for her . There is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding MacLaine . MacLaine is treated a worthless by everyone , while the blond bimbo is treated a a princess and an intellectual ; the ironic truth is that the latter 's character come off a rather dumb and not at all a intellectual ; her behaviour , comment , and opinion are mostly clichéd , silly , confused , pretentious , and primitive . At least MacLaine 's character KNOWS that she ( MacLaine ) is dumb . There is another irony that I did n't fail to notice : Sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story - much like the writer of this movie , and that 's why he came up with the corny , crappy finale . The film basically ha a solid cast , and the photography is nice , but the script , though sometimes okay , relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality-based character and event . If you 're interested in reading my `` biography '' of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood intellectual , contact me by e-mail .",0
"This show wa Fabulous . It wa intricate and well written and all the character where likable with out being horribly sweet . Even Jonathan Cake the philandering boyfriend wa likable . Since our airwave are filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars , it wa nice to see a drama that wa not too soap opera like . It wa always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance . It really is annoying that we finally get a show that make you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of u do n't even pay attention to . Some of u are not sheep . This show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fan .",1
"I heard tell that Madonna wa briefly considered for the Catherine Tremell role . Compared to Sharon Stone , Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH . She 's not even close . EVIL INCARNATE : Sharon Stone is a bit long in the tooth , the ameliorative effect of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding . However , she artfully treat u to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption . In the obligatory sex scene , she project pure , crystalline lust . Especially her hooded , luminous eye and a face flat with pleasure . Thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage technique , the harsh line of age are only occasionally manifest . Rather , she seems to have a slight golden glow ( YES , YEATS ) . The location gave u a view of London that is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes .The Catherine character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky star that our path never crossed . I would n't have had a chance . THE ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT ; ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP : I must briefly comment on the original 1992 film , set in San Francisco , a beautiful city worthy of this film . It is outstanding , from the music to the location to the set , and so on . Paul Verhoven pulled striking performance out of the cast and crew . That the main Baddie wa a woman did not escape the scrutiny of Bay Area Gay and Lesbian activist group . Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied . SWELL . These philosophical pygmy demanded editorial control over the script , insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agenda . Example : Sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny , they demanded that the lead role be switched from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY . On location in San Francisco , the gentle , tolerant activist did their best to sabotage filming of the scene with noise , flashing light and other tactic . The Executive Producers , Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna , vowed to fight any effort to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining order against the disruptive tactic . BLOWBACK : Thanks to the fulminating activist , the film got huge national press coverage - million of dollar worth of free advertising . Their call for viewer to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customer waiting in long line wherever the film wa launched . It also received widespread critical acclaim . It wa , in the word of the reptilian Hackett in NETWORK , `` A BIG- TITTED HIT ! '' Sorry , Gentle Reader ; I just could n't resist that one . Yes , it 's a gibe . In conclusion , I believe that both BASIC INSTINCT 1 AND 2 , with their brilliant musical score , aesthetic and acting , are work of art that deserve protection under our Constitution .",1
"The plot wa very thin , although the idea of naked , sexy , man eating siren is a good one . The film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie/splatter/lesbian mouth licking shot in between . The character were wooden and one dimensional . The ending made no sense . Considering it had Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson in it , you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effect . Some of the effect were quite good but there were just too few of them . Brownie point go for occasional flash of tit and bush , naturally , and of course the lesbian moment . I also thought that the scene with the siren bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed a an innovative take on the 'shower scene ' The film had many of the element that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely . If I had been watching this alone and aged 15 , i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minute ( with 1 hand of the remote control ) , then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza ...",0
"Many time the description `` full of sound and fury signifying nothing '' is used and is right on target . Unfortunately `` Code 46 '' lack both sound and fury . A bit of fury would have been greatly appreciated . Tim Robbins character ( William ) is so lacking in passion that the idea of his falling instantly in love with Maria ( Samantha Morton ) seems almost absurd . These folk are so passionless that one begin to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world ha been dosed with thorazine . There is a `` Brave New World '' sort of atmosphere to the film that is helped along by every scene being shot about 2-3 stop overexposed . Unfortunately this technique get tedious and rather hard on the eye . The cutesy mishmash of language also grows tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for it existence . Many futuristic , scifi film are criticized for being all flash and no substance . This film ha neither flash nor substance . Its a code 6 all the way .",0
"Having watched all of the Star Trek TV series episode many time each since the 1960s , most being quite good to superb , and only very few being mediocre , my opinion is that this one is the worst of all . In fact , I think it 's so poorly executed a to be an embarrassment to the series . It 's not that the story is so bad , although it 's not particularly outstanding in any way , but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead character , meaning those other than the regular in this case . Barbara Anderson give her weakest performance ever a the daughter of a mass killer , and who is on a mission of a sort . She practically call in the role from a phone , and show no real emotive ability here . Although usually she 's never used a more than a pretty face in most of her film/TV role , usually small part , she ha done much better . Arnold Moss a her father give new meaning to the term 'Ham ' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s Star Trek episode that outdid William Shatner in this area , and actually make Shatner look superb by comparison . And he get to play a Shakespearian actor no le , which give him more impetus to overact , and he doe so . Other than these two lead being so weak , the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minute . I say this because I told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast a pre-teens . His reply wa , Yeah , you 're right . Skip this one and watch the much superior Menagerie episode which were originally televised right before .",0
"Although I 'm a girl , thankfully I have a sense of humor and realize that this really IS a funny anime ! Watching it doe give you an overwhelming feeling that it 's definitely a guy show but that doe n't take away from the fact that it hilarious ! 10/10",1
"I remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 mile to Graceland , it all came flooding back . Why this ha n't had a Video or DVD release yet ? It 's sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making ha never been released while other rubbish ha been . In fact this is the one John Carpenter film that ha n't been released . In fact i have n't seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it . Kurt Russell wa the perfect choice for the role of Elvis . This is definitely a role he wa born to play . John carpenter 's break from horror brought this gem that i 'd love the TV to play again . It is well acted and well performed a far a the singing go . Belting out most of Elvis 's greatest hit with gusto . I think this also wa the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movie ( Escape from New York , The Thing , Big trouble in little china , and Escape from L.A . Someone ha got to release this before someone doe a remake or their own version of his life , which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one ha . If this doe n't get released then we are gon na be in Heartbreak Hotel .",1
"To be honest , I did never read one of the comic and can not remember part 2 and 3 at all . I can compare to the first part ( Werner - Beinhart ) and this one here is really disappointing , compared to part1 a well a compared to most other movie I watched the last week . The first minute seam to be just a needle clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse . There are a few good ( funny ) scene , but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of German film industry that can not succeed ( nearly a usual ) . One good thing : The movie is quite short ( 75 min . ) The bad thing : It only contains story and joke for 45 Minutes ; ) - > Do n't watch it",0
"I dug this out and watched it tonight . I honestly think it must be 20 year since the last time I saw it . I remember it being a seriously flawed film . I do n't remember it being THIS bad ! ! ! ! ! I am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly . Who am I to blame for this ? The 2 guy who wrote ( and I use that word loosely ) the script ? The casting director who so terribly miscast at least 3 major character in the story ? ( Only 2 of them are among `` the amazing 5 '' . ) The director , who clearly refused to take it seriously , and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing & bad acting everywhere ? ( I LIKED the theme song -- but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film ! ) Don Black , who should be ASHAMED at some of the lyric he wrote for that music ? It figure that I should pull this out , le than a week after re-reading the comic-book adaptation . The first 15-20 minute of the film more-or-less ( really , LESS ) parallel the first issue of the comic . As I watched it tonight , I kept wondering -- why wa ALMOST every single detail changed ? Doc showing up , then using his wrist-watch remote-control to open the safe , and the sniper 's bullet missing him by 5 inch because the refractive glass , were just about the only thing left the same . I mean , if you 're gon na do an `` adaptation '' , WHY in God 's name change EVERYTHING ? ? ? Once they leave Doc 's HQ , virtually NOTHING is a it wa in the comic ( which , given Roy Thomas , I figure probably follows the book ) . I read somewhere they actually combined element of 2 different novel into one movie . Again -- WHY ? I 've heard it wa changed because they were n't able to secure the kind of budget they wanted . I look at the film , and think ... LACK OF MONEY in NO WAY explains what I saw on the screen ! ! You know , when people complain about Joel Schumacher , they should really take a look at this thing . The best thing I can say is , I think it would make a great double-feature with the 1966 BATMAN feature -- and probably a great triple-bill with that and the 1980 FLASH GORDON . All 3 film are `` silly '' . Maybe we can `` blame '' the 1966 film ( and TV series ) for this . Some fan have complained over the year that Adam West 's BATMAN ruined the image of comic-books in the mind of generation of non-comics fan . I think the same could be said for Hollywood . I 'm reminded of how many really , really BAD film based on `` classic '' character have been made over the year , especially ( it seems to me ) in the late 70 's & early 80 's . Charlie Chan , Fu Manchu , Tarzan , Buck Rogers , Flash Gordon , The Lone Ranger -- all `` murdered '' by Hollywood type who think , `` OH , comic-books ! So you know it 's supposed to be STUPID ! '' More like they 're the `` stupid '' one . What a waste of potential . Let me say some good thing ... Despite the script and the directing , Ron Ely is GREAT . When I read a DOC SAVAGE story , I do n't think of the James Bama painting , I think of Ely . Bill Lucking ( who later wa a regular on THE A-TEAM ) is terrific . Eldon Quick ( who I 've seen somewhere else , but ca n't recall where ) is terrific . Paul Gleason -- who I absolutely HATED with a passion and a vengeance in THE BREAKFAST CLUB ( `` teacher '' like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere ) , may be the best of the `` amazing 5 '' in the film . Pamela Hensley -- though her part wa almost unrecognizable from the original story -- is terrific . Before she let her hair down , I also realized she looked a HELL of a lot like `` Ardala Valmar '' from those awful John Calkins BUCK ROGERS strip I just read the other day . She 's got a big nose like Ardala -- only not quite a pronounced . The comic Ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie Princess Aura -- or Cher . Or maybe Streisand . Take yer pick . ( Ardala actually got plastic surgery in the George Tuska strip -- after , she wa stunning ! ) Paul Wexler , funny enough , I saw just last week in a GET SMART episode . I wonder if he wa anything like the character he wa supposed to be playing ? I do n't know , because that character sure wa n't in the movie the film take it title from .",0
"This movie is a piece of the time in which it wa made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy coated during the late 60 and early 70 . The producer did not try to create some happy ending that did n't exist . The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that , hopefully would spur them on to action . At least that 's how it seemed at the time . In today 's movie world this movie would probably not be done . There would , definitely , not be this ending , however realistic . The sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movement of that time .",1
"this film ha it good point : hot chick people die the problem ... the hot Chicks barley get nude and you do n't get to see many of the people dieing , mostly just lot of fast movement and screaming though there were two good kill scene . also for those of you watching this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a side chearator with a very small role and Minor nude scene . What this film needed .. script and story would be nice but I will not complain about that .. simply put it need more nudity and better kill scene cuz let face it that is why we watch these flick ... I would n't waste my money on it ... and if you must , wait until it 's on the OLD shelf at your local video store",0
"I think it 's two year ago since I have seen the movie and till this day it 's the worst film I have ever seen . The only thing I thought after seeing this movie wa that it wa made for some tax reason . So after all this time I finally spilled my gut ; ) And now IMDb say I have to fill 10 line with comment : `` Sorry , you must provide at least 10 line in your comment . Please return to the edit window ( or use the BACK option if this is n't a new window ) . '' Please there is nothing to say anymore ... Sorry for some bad English .",0
"Pierce Brosnan ha sipped his last Martini and return , in an outrageous self-parody , a the aging foul-mouthed boozy assassin Julian Noble , who ha a particular fondness for teenage girl , bullfight and tacky clothes . During a job in Mexico City he meet Danny ( Greg Kinnear ) , a straight-faced Denver suburban business-man , who 's in town to make his deal of-a-life-time , in a hotel bar . Despite their completely different personality and Julian 's crude and insensible remark , they become friend . Largely carried by the performance of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear , director Richard Shepard revealed that he did n't write the film with Pierce Brosnan in mind , but I can hardly imagine this without him . He prof to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or cold-war spy . The scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar ( stunning set and beautifully photographed ) really is a bravura piece of acting skill . The scene last almost fifteen minute , and although it wa probably carefully scripted , the two actor are largely improvising , but they succeed wonderfully ! It almost feel like a new standard in screen acting . Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichés and the actor ' own typecasting ( Brosnan 's James Bond in particular ) , and you got one of the most delightful pairing in recent Hollywood . Sadly , the story wear thin after a while . After an hour , the film just run out of steam . Nevertheless , and I ca n't put my finger on it exactly , I did enjoy this very much . It just feel very fresh and original , with some imaginative use of set and lighting , and some hint to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville . The other character are n't given much to do , but this film doe offer something new , in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genre into quite an entertaining spoof . Very amusing . Camera Obscura -- - 7/10",1
This is probably the only female Ninja movie ever made . It 's great a a B film and the action sequence are a lot of fun to watch . This movie is just so deliciously 80 's . You 'll never see another film like it . Check it out for some 80 's retro fun .,1
"I loved October Sky . The thing I loved most had to be the music . It worked two way : in the first hour of the film , it give the viewer a time-frame . This is done by playing song from the late Fifties . In the second hour , an instrumental score take over . The music now fit the mood of the film perfectly . I did not only enjoy the music , I also quite enjoyed the cast . Jake Gyllenhaal a Homer Hickam wa especially a surprise for me . He gave off a first-class performance , a did Chris Owen ( Quentin ) and Chris Cooper ( John Hickam ) . I 've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now , and both time I thoroughly enjoyed myself .",1
"I first saw this one when it wa first shown , so I 'm not too objective about it . It really managed to scare me , partly because it wa so late at night , but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story ( the same thing that helped Dark Shadows itself ) . And the casting wa so right . I hardly know Shane Briant from anything else , so it might not be so right to call HIM `` well-cast , '' but to me , he IS Dorian Gray . And a far a the other male actor , the one who fit his part so well wa Nigel Davenport ( who 's so good at `` larger than life '' character ) a Sir Henry . And John Karlen , a sort of Dan Curtis `` repertory player '' at the time , because of Dark Shadows . As one poster point out , this version manages to include the involvement with men , in a fairly subtle way . The scene where Dorian recites a list of men 's name to John Karlen 's character , a a way of blackmailing him , and the look on Karlen 's face , were very well-done . ( If that scene were done now , it would probably be done in a TOO OBVIOUS way , and be bad by comparison . ) I saw it when `` Dorian Gray '' wa barely a name to me , let alone more , so even more than the famous 1945 version ( which is rightly famous ) , this is THE version to me .",1
"Latter Days is a very , VERY independent movie . And compared to many of today 's more modern film , it 's lacking on many part . The shooting seems at time quite amateurish , the dialogue can be a bit chopped up and the character are not impressively complex . So , do n't have too high hope for this movie , because a I 've said , it 's very independent . But whatever it lack in the concrete aspect of the film can be overlooked because of the story 's charm ! I can not claim that the plot is outstandingly original , but the story is still beautiful and heart-warming in many way ! It 's not about being gay versus being straight , it 's about faith , and how you decide to run your own life ! It 's a silly story , that make you want to both cry and smile at the same time ! So to be honest , Latter Days is far from perfect , but I truly loved the movie and I highly recommend it ! It 's very critical towards the religious aspect of our society , and there is homosexuality involved - but approach it with an open mind , and I 'm pretty sure that most people will enjoy it a much a myself !",1
"I first saw this mini-series a a child and though I am a child no longer , I still love it ! ! ! Professional copy are hard to find , however , when it 's on DVD , it 's MINE ! ! ! = ] Great casting , marvellous plot , and plenty of action , romance , and even quite a bit of well-placed comedy . I 'm not a historian by nature , but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction !",1
"This is not an all-around terrible comedy , but it is very DULL . It ha barely any laugh , and it waste it lavish production value . There is one poignant moment near the end , when Fu Manchu offer a dose of his elixir to his `` nemesis '' and tell him that `` You 've been my one worthy adversary ; and now we can start all over again '' . That scene , however , along with Burt Kwouk 's amusing cameo in the beginning , are the only memorable part of the movie . ( * 1/2 )",0
1st watched 6/21/2001 - 2 out of 10 ( Dir-Emmanuel Itier ) : Pretty much worthless supposed thriller that spends more time drawing u into sexual encounter with and without the star 'Amber Smith . ' It try to wrap a story around the sex scene but a usual with these type of movie it is not done very well . I wa so bored with this movie that I actually fast-forwarded thru the ending to get it over with . The video version I watched wa called 'Tell Me No Lies . ',0
"Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who wa active in the early 20th century . The film capture and interprets his artistic method ( 'sketching ' poem ) , his inspiration ( the spirit of nature and it fantastic beauty ) and his struggle to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination . The film integrated excerpt of Miyazawa 's poem into the plot beautifully . His relationship with his student wa powerful , especially in one scene where he offer everything he ha to a student who ha just been caught stealing material from the classroom . Miyazawa 's selfless compassion for the farmer in his village , his sister and other unfortunate people can serve a a lesson to u all . Furthermore , Miyazawa 's devotion to science wa also nicely portrayed . In a time when Western idea were still met with skepticism , especially in provincial town like the one where Miyazawa grew up , he understands it usefulness in helping his fellow villager and is inspired by it elegance . The way the film presented moment of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted . I felt that the CGI integrated into the film , while groundbreaking an innovative , clashed with the more organic animation . It could be argued that this wa intentional to represent conflict within the main character , but I found it rather unaesthetic . I also wish that the film had discussed Miyazawa 's Buddhist influence , but it worked fine without it . I though this film wa very well done . I give it a 9/10 , with the one point being deducted for the CGI . Otherwise the animation , plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt . I have n't seen any other film by Kawamori Shoji , but after seeing this one I will be sure to give them a chance .",1
"Wow ... Reading through these comment , I see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the US and ... the Dutch ! The US P.o.V . appears to be that this is quite a good little movie , Parker being a likable hero , the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality . All three Dutch reviewer view the world through a totally different pair of glass it seems . They categorically and in surprisingly similar term agree the movie is a disaster . Far be it from me to take side in what appears to be a dispute between culture , on this item a wide apart a the ocean that separate them geographically . Still , based on factual observation - I saw the movie with my very own eye - I suspect the Dutch are not too far off the mark : `` Parker Kane '' is poorly made , utterly boring , and really not worth the celluloid that wa no doubt wasted in it creation .",0
"River Queen attempt to pack a complicated , sweeping , historical narrative into just under two hour . There are some breathtaking battle scene and the Wanganui scenery is beautifully captured . However , the film did suffer from some poor lead - Samantha Morton ( Sarah ) especially came across a unconvincing . There seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played - a a helpless waif tossed by fate or a a strong , determined character with a clear view of her destiny . Kiefer Sutherland 's character - Private Doyle - seemed to be pointless and for the most part - unintelligible . Keifer 's Irish brogue need a little polishing . On the other hand , Cliff Curtis , Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene ( a Sarah 's son `` Boy '' ) were well rounded and believable . The last 20 minute of River Queen came across a particularly compressed and rushed . It seemed a if they decided they had to tie up all the loose end before 120 minute were up . E.g . How on earth did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle ? No explanation and very unsatisfying . I did go to this movie with an open mind . I had n't read or heard anything much apart from it troubled production . What I experienced wa a mish mash of New Zealand history , beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing .",0
"most of the bad review on this website blame `` Hood of the Living Dead '' for one ( or more ) of the following reason : 1 ) it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting ; 2 ) it wa so bad it made me laugh 3 ) it is something I could do myself . I wo n't even discus the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff or not . I must say , however , that I still fail to understand people renting such a movie a `` Hood of the Living Dead '' and then looking surprised when they realize it is not a polished and cute a a romantic comedy with Lindsay Lohan or Matthew Mc Conaughey . As for the second point , I really do n't see what 's so wrong with laughing . I personally like to laugh , and love movie that make me to , be they comedy or horror flick . When in `` Hammerhead '' I saw this girl stepping into a PUDDLE and the shark-man came out of it to eat her , I just cracked up . And I wa grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten second of pure fun . Honestly , laughing just make me feel good , while it seems that many people writing review see it a a bad bad thing . If you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie , `` Hood of the Living Dead '' and low-budget flick are definitely not for you . But please do n't come and tell u that you find them laughable . We already know it . This is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place . However , it is the third point that leaf totally baffled . Just several year ago people were lining up out of theater to see `` Blair Witch Project '' , which is a way more rudimentary , boring , plot-less and bad-acted movie than `` Hood of the Living Dead '' ( and take itself way too seriously too ) . Moreover , half a million people go on YouTube every day to see the short film of `` Lonelygirl15 '' , which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend , a room and a webcam could do ! Not to talk about all of the even more amateurish video you can find there . Why do n't people blame those clip for bad acting and non-existing plot ? I think it is one of the best thing of our time that everyone , with affordable technology and a bunch of friend , can make their own movie and share them with people that have similar interest . And I feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekend with their friend making a honestly bad ( yet refreshing ) piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video game alone . Leave aside your bias and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b-movies , and you 'll see that `` Hood of the Living Dead '' can bring you almost a much fun a it did to it maker ! If you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movie , I recommend `` Zombiez '' , `` The Ghosts of Edendale '' , `` The Killer Eye '' , `` Monster Man '' , `` Do n't Look in the Basement '' , `` The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made '' , `` Redneck Zombies '' , `` Jesus Christ Vampyre-Slayer '' and `` Habit '' .",1
"This wa a great anime . True the animation is old but it still worth watching and ha a better plot than Ninja Scroll , the problem that it wa kinda long . Japanese movie star Hiroyuki Sanada who played Ujio from Last Samurai played the main character Jiro and it wa directed by Rintaro who did Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis . The anime ha some good animation for an old anime , interesting character like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan and of course let not forget the beautiful musical score in the film . All in all this movie is worth watching for fan of anime , animation in general , action , and Samurai/Ninja flick . Despite the low in the film that did n't the film from being a great film to watch . Do n't miss this film .",1
"This movie deal with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth . It is so true , that I do n't know Klapisch did to reach such a masterpiece ... Definitely one of my top 5 movie . It reminds me of the famous song `` This is my life , my life , life is life ... '' 10/10",1
"This movie is nothing short of a dark , gritty masterpiece . I may be bias , a the Apartheid era is an area I 've always felt for . But I 'd say it rank right up with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country . Sadly up until a few day ago I 'd never even heard of this movie . Inside is one of the most underrated film of all time , probably because it wa a small film company , I 'd never even heard of it before . Eric Stoltz , one of my favorite actor anyway , is believable and dramatic , Nigel Hawthorne play his dastardly role well . Do not look for humor in this film , there is none . It is real , savage and gritty to the last , and to the sensitive I 'd say bring a box of tissue . But movie a great a this make you wonder , why is it that the greatest film are often never heard of ?",1
"Movie about two Australian girl -- Debbie ( Nell Schofield ) and Sue ( Sue Knight ) -- and what happens when they become girlfriend of two surfer guy . I caught this at an art cinema here in America in 1981 . Technically I wa still a teenager ( I wa 19 ) so I wa interested in seeing how Australian teen acted . Script wise there 's nothing new here . It show the usual teenage adventure dealing with dating , sex , suicide etc etc . I always knew what wa going to happen before it did but I wa never bored . What I found interesting wa , despite the accent and a few change in clothes and hair , these teenager are n't much different than American teen . They had many of the same difficulty and hang-up . Also this wa based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventure and ( I heard ) it wa a faithful adaptation of it . The acting wa just OK but the actor were attractive and this wa well-made and pretty interesting . So this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it 's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kid . I give it a 7 .",1
"As a French , i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that , at some default of Westerners , at Spy movie etc ... and at a lot of other thing too , en route ... I already saw it 3 time and each time i discovered new thing and laughed to tear ... Jean Dujardin , Bérénice Béjo , Aure Atika the director and all the cast , all the crew did a fantastic job . This movie is funny but is although much more than that : it 's got plenty of level to it . You laugh because of simple gag , because of some critic made with wit ( the movie 's courageous enough to be critical ) , because of physical comedy , because you believe in the character etc ... Esthetically and musically , it 's a success too . Go see it if you can .",1
"This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composer ( Gershwin ) and a nice 'Parisien ' atmosphere which give the movie a lot of charm , but in term of a story .. well it 's not really there . Or at least , not very well worked out . The acting is also not so smooth by Caron . But I liked some of the dialogue , I liked the scene at the Seine , I liked the character played by Levant , the color ; and the dancing of course , which is quite magnificent . A 7.5 - 8 seems on the dot to me .",1
As kid movie it is great . For the family it just suck . I wa truly hoping for something like the Goonies which is a great film for all age . This movie wa just geared too much to the kid with the silly script and character calling each other little name like booger breath . ? ? ? Alan Cummings wa however a delight . And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie ... just because there is a theme song closely resembling the Willy Wonka song doesnt make this film anything like Willy Wonka .,0
"Okay . Here 's the thing . I 've read through the comment of other viewer -- - some trashing the film and some saying it 's the funniest , darkest , blackest comedy ever made . Whiffs of Tarantino , etc . Well , not exactly . But , guess what ? It 's still an enjoyable and , ultimately , funny film . Not brilliant , not trash . Liv Tyler give a great performance and you absolutely can not take your eye off her . She 's a woman with very strong decorating idea ... Matt Dillon , a greatly underrated and under-used actor , is wonderful , a ever . He always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul , and he pull off the comedy beautifully . Ditto John Goodman ( though the religious overtone , probably funny in the script , really do n't work ) . Paul Reiser is very good -- - definitely better than he wa on TV . The usually unbearable Michael Douglas is actually great in this role . As for his coif , well , see the film . Between this and `` Wonder Boys , '' you 're actually reminded of the fact that Douglas can act . The movie will make you laugh in part . Okay , not exactly belly-laughing , but definitely in the I'm-amused-I'm-very-amused category . If you 're renting this expecting to see another `` Pulp Fiction , '' forget it . But if want something kinda hip and kinda fun , this is a damned good choice .",1
"Well I do n't know much about anything , but I sure liked this film . In short , it wa creative , humorous , simple , and heartwarming . In other word , it wa everything it set out to be . The story is set around a girl 's first love , ( a the title suggests ) and I certainly should warn you : expect nothing challenging or provocative in term of the subject matter here . I mean , it is a child 's cartoon . It 's really just a simple story , but it 's told well , and it hold your attention well . In the end : it 's short , it 's funny , it 's cute , it 's simple , it 's good .",1
"If you like bad movie ( and you must to watch this one ) here 's a good one . Not quite a funny a the first , but much lower quality . A must-see for fan of Jack Frost a well a anyone up for a good laugh at the writing .",0
"After watching this movie , I could n't help but notice the parallel between it and another film called America 3000 . Both were very bad mid 1980 's post apocalypse disaster on celluloid . Obviously fake set , wooden acting and stupid monster are found in both film . About the only difference between the two is that the lead villainess here ( played by Angelika Jager ) ha a very thick accent . Avoid this one unless you 're watching the MST3K version . Joel and the bot barely salvage this turkey .",0
"I 'd even say some shade of Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM , which is seen a a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fan . By the way , did you know that Annie Hall wa first conceived a a murder mystery ? Anyhow , Woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one . The plot turn are nice and tight . I will say that in the first 20 minute or so , some of the actor are a little too hasty at delivering their line , but stick around . Scarlett Johansson prof well-cast in the Diane Keaton-type role , and at no time is there any uncomfortable moment between her and the much older Woody . No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman .",1
"Well , I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film . The only thing I did n't like wa they did n't have much dancing a I thought there would be . But I have to say the it wa a good dance film . I think there should be more song too . But it wa a good film a i said before ! My rating 9/10 !",1
"I do n't often give one star review , but the computer wo n't let me do negative number . The opening title tell u we 're in deep water already . Although this is a low budget exploitation film , there are 17 producer credited . No . No . At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth come home to his family in an upscale gated community . The house is a pigsty . His wife , Della ( Kim Basinger ) ha let the child run amok all day . OK. We 're already in deep water . Ms. Basinger wa 55 year old when the film came out . Uh , are these her child or grandchild ? It 's Christmas Eve . Della drive to the mall , a lengthy scene that could have been cut . To bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drive past football player in full uniform playing in pouring rain on Christmas Eve . Sure . For a bonus she see a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it . We get some actual suspense in the driving scene , though . It 's raining and traffic is bad . First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time . Then later Della try to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time , at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone . She wanders the mall , see an old friend from college , try to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh , maybe her husband is grumpy because he 's going broke , but that 's too complicated for the script to follow . In the parking lot she run afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of film . One White boy ( Lukas Hass watching his career go down the toilet ) , one Black , one Asian , and one Hispanic . Imagine a company of Up with People gone to the bad and you 'll have the idea . Although they have a gun she give them attitude . A mall cop come to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head , firing more than once . The parking lot is crowded a can be , people everywhere , and nobody notice . Della escape in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area , she drive to a construction site , where she kill all four bad boy one at a time with simply the tool ( literally ) at hand . MAJOR spoiler ahead . She drive back home . The car poop out so she walk through the pouring rain . Checks on the child , go downstairs , and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall show him the gun and shoot him at point blank range . The experience with the four punk wa supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della . Instead we know that her child will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home , because the State will collect them while she answer to murder one charge . The four punk can be classified a justifiable homicide in self defense . The husband , different story . I 'm so glad I saw this on cable . If I 'd seen it in a theater ( did it get any release ? ) I 'd have been furious . As is , I 'm just sad seeing talent like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas waste themselves on garbage like this . One very good thing , though . This wa written and directed by Susan Montford . Ms. Montford ha not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd . There is justice in the world .",0
"I had mixed feeling for `` Les Valseuses '' ( 1974 ) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up liking it . I would not call it vulgar ( `` Dumb and Dumber '' is vulgar , `` The Sweetest Thing '' is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid ) ; I would call it shocking and offensive . I can understand why many viewer , especially , the female would not like or even hate it . It is the epitome of misogyny ( or so it seems ) , and the way two antihero treat every woman they 'd meet seems unspeakable . But the more I think of it the more I realize that it somehow come off a a delightful little gem . I am fascinated how Blier wa able to get away with it . The movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable : it is well written , the acting by all is first - class , and the music is sweet and melancholic . Actually , when I think of it , two buddy had done something good to the woman they came across to : they prepared a woman in the train ( the lovely , docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debut in René Clément 's `` Forbidden Games '' ( 1952 ) at age 6 ) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two month ; they found a man who wa finally able to get a frigid Marie-Ange ( Miou-Miou ) exited and satisfied ; they enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert ( in one of her early screen appearance . ) Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level . In short , I am not sure I 'd like to meet Gérard Depardieu 's Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere 's Pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but I had a good time watching the movie and two hour almost flew - it wa never boring .",1
"If you are a fan of Zorro , Indiana Jones , or action in general this is a must-see . Directed by Republic 's ace team of William Witney and John English , and starring Reed Hadley a Don Diego/Zorro , this serial delivers ! I wo n't bore you with the plot ( who care ? le talking , more fighting ) ; what really matter here is Hadley 's superb interpretation of the character/s and the stunt work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt . * * * STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW * * * You can see the influence this film had on Lucas and Spielberg -- Zorro get caught in the original version of the Star Wars trash compactor in one chapter , trapped on a rope bridge a'la Temple of Doom in another , doe a Raiders horse-to-coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddie knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him , exactly a Mola Ram doe to Indy in Temple of Doom . In addition to all this , the whip action is great a Zorro disarms villain , swing to safety , etc . with his trusty lash . Most of the sword work is fair to lame , except for chapter one , which feature a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword/stunt legend Ralph Faulkner , who make a rare screen appearance a the evil Rodriguez . This wa the first serial I ever saw , on Matinée at the Bijou when I wa a kid and I have been hooked on them ever since . Zorro 's Fighting Legion delivers `` Z '' good !",1
"I purchased this movie at a car boot sale , so I wa not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level a A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) or The Hills Have Eyes ( 1977 ) but I thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch . However , it proved to be not at all enjoyable , but instead the acting and the general movie wa mock-able , such a the way the the 'unsees killer ' murder his victim and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde woman . It wa a stereotypical horror film . I say this because of the following reason : 1 ) Three blonde woman in danger , the majority get killed . 2 ) One survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer . 3 ) Surprise surprise , help arrives in the form of a shotgun ! By using three simple point , I have saved you two odd hour by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie , so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it .",0

"BBC 's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by Sarah Waters ... '' Fingersmith '' . Life is tough without money , especially in Dickensian London . Dark deed lead to despicable dilemmas.Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ? ? Elaine Cassidy a `` Maud Lilly '' and Sally Hawkins a `` Sue Trinder '' both give fantastic performance a the leading lady asking this question ... OF EACH OTHER ... whilst Rupert Evans shine a the delightfully bad `` Gentleman '' .. with great support from Imelda Staunton 's `` Mrs Sucksby '' , David Troughton 's `` Mr Ibbs '' and Charles Dance 's `` Uncle '' . The plot twist and turn and I wa n't sure I could be led to care about character able to hurt and use each other in this way ... but somehow .. i do care ... and thats because of the quality of the performance ... love feel like love .. hate feel like hate ... betrayal .. confusion .. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the DVD and enjoy . ( Elaine Cassidy is just great in this .. gorgeous in fact .... i have to declare i am in her fan club ... Hi Elaine : )",1
"In order to stop her homosexual friend Albert ( Perry King ) from being deported back to Belgium , Stella ( Meg Foster ) decides to marry him . The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian . The two have their separate life when one night after Albert 's birthday party , they fall into bed and then into love . Later in the film after falling in love , Stella suspect Albert of cheating and show up at his job one night late after closing . What she find will leave the viewer stunned . This is a great film , very original . Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their role that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here . Very controversial upon it release in 1978 , the `` R '' rated film is now `` PG '' in this much more liberal time . Recently released on DVD , the disc contains a `` Making Of '' segment on the special feature and in it it 's stated that the film wa based on an actual story so the viewer who say the film is not `` real '' are mistaken . Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons-these are the issue explored in this wonderful film for everyone who ha ever loved !",1
"I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movie like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM , American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this . Perhaps a a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective career , Messiah of Evil ha potential , but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it ca n't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off . The premise involves a young girl who travel to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back . It doe n't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it work admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil need to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70 's exploitation a an example of artful mystery horror . The surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on a the daughter stumble upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon ' , a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic ( played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie ) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dog ' a little later , the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who ha inexplicably removed all of her father 's painting from the shop and last but not least a retarded , murderous , squirrel-eating albino . Part of the movie 's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre convention every step of the way . Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator , with Messiah of Evil the boundary between the 'intentional ' , the 'unintentional ' and the 'did n't really expect it to come out this way but it 's good enough - WRAP SCENE ' blur hopelessly . Take for example the double narration that flow in and out of the picture in a drug-addled , feverish , stream-of-consciousness way , one coming from the daughter a she wanders from place to place in search for her father , and the other narrated by her father 's voice a she read his diary . While we 're still talking about a 'living dead ' picture , Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconception of what a zombie movie is supposed to be . The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse , bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'Dark Stranger ' who came from the wood one day . In the meantime Hyuck find time for snippet of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of year ( you can hear the MST3K line already : 'man is dead , only his capitalist food tin remain ' ) and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater . I generally think that the surreal work in careful , well measured dos - how is the absurd to work if it 's not hidden within the perfectly normal ? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand . When the albino for example pick up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her , you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience , amused and satisfied with his own hijinks . The general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark , the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either . Add to that the choppy editing , average acting and Hyuck 's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty street of coastal town are criminally misused - and I 'd file Messiah under 'missed opportunity ' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it 's not particularly gory , trashy or sleazy .",0
"In the wasteland that Hollywood Productions have become of late , this movie - in and of itself - is truly `` MANNA FROM HEAVEN '' ! ! ! In what could best be described a a `` cute '' movie , approximately 350 year of movie acting experience ( allright - give or take 100 year ! ) joyously light up the screen to tell a tale of deceit , remorse , and redemption about a Catholic Family in Buffalo , NY . Truly well-positioned to take it place in the `` feel-good '' movie genre , this quiet little independent film by the Burton Sisters ' FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart , all while renewing your faith in mankind . From the spectacular opening scene shot of Buffalo , NY to the final credit , the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family , anywhere . Yet , somehow this particular gathering of family and `` family by association '' in a small , non-descript house in Buffalo more than fit the bill . If you 've never been to Buffalo , you 'll leave the theater with thought of `` shuffling off '' for a visit ! Shots of the city landmark and surroundings help to bring a quaint , down to earth tone to the film - which suit it just fine . The quiet beauty of the `` Queen City of the Great Lakes '' compliment , rather than detracts from the tale that is being told . If only more movie would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country 's `` second city '' instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere , the end result would be so much more believable . Great performance by Shirley Jones , Frank Gorshin , Wendy Malick , Jill Eickenberry , and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts Hollywood 's `` flavor of the week '' any time ! GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! You 've wandered in Hollywood 's desert for too long !",1
"I have done a lot of international travel , both on business and a a tourist . For both type I assure you the best advice is also the oldest : Always drink the wine of the country . In this movie the archangel Michael come to Earth on business , wrap it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring . Boy ! Does he `` drink the wine of the country . '' Could man be drunk forever with liquor , love and fight He 'd lief rise up of morning and lief lie down of night . These are thing you ca n't do in Heaven so he enjoys them while he 's here ! Of course it turn out he had a couple of other job to tackle and , if he is le direct about them than he wa about the first one , he is just a successful . The final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful . Jean Stapleton get to dance with John Travolta .",1
"Paul Reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie . Peter Falk give the performance of his life . It is worthy of an Academy Award . This wa one of the most poignant and funny movie of the year . Reiser 's wit is fantastic and he is a good a it get and a he wa in his long running TV sitcom `` Mad about You '' . Peter Falk did a masterful job a his dad , and Peter who is now 78 year young made u laugh and cry at the same time . The supporting cast wa equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins . It is a must see movie for 2005 . We bet that everyone across all age and religion will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another . We have mother and father and sibling like these in the movie . We have all had the good and bad time together and wish thing were the same but different .",1
"Wow . this movie is the voice of a climbing generation . Director Sam Keith take u to the darkest depth of Man 's soul where we find love , life , and top-roping . World-weary Telly ( Leo Fitzpatrick ) follows his heart and his anchor through a cerebral journey to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic Colorado . Instead , Telly meet confrontation in Don ( Jason Bortz ) , the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanity foible . The epic film come to a climbax at a gut-wrenching top-roping competition that will make even the strongest willed viewer squeamish at the dizzying height . This movie ha it all : Top-roping outside , Top-roping in the gym , Cut-off short and sleeveless flannel shirt , Awesome climbing footage ( some so good , you see it 2 or 3 time ! ) , Bear and snake attack . I gave the movie 8 out of 10 because I wanted to see the romance develop a bit more . It seemed a if the film wa leading up to a spicy , top-roped sex scene between Telly and his new lover , but ala , it would n't fit into the already jam-packed hour and a half thrill ride . Fans of Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II will find this flick to be a diamond in the rough . Overall , if you are ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing , this is the film for you ! ! ! 1",1

"I wa very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating , when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it . This really is one of the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen many bad movie . It look like a good movie in the beginning , but when he come into surgery i could n't believe how bad it got . This voice-over destroys EVERYTHING ! Just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he say . I saw the movie in German so i do n't really know what he said in English , but ironic stuff like `` Yeah right , it doe n't hurt .. '' ? ... what is this ? Telling yourself `` think about something else '' and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just ... stupid . And his mother ... how the hell doe she figure something like that out ? Someone come to tell her , her son died in surgery ( what she kind of had to expect ) . Plus she found some letter in Jessica Albas bag . plus that `` she know the hospital '' stuff ... and then it take her `` one second '' to figure it out ? What the hell ? ^^ And the ending ... why doe the police bust them ? The patient died in surgery , thats all that happened . That drunk doctor doe n't know anything else either ... and then they bust them all , even the girlfriend ? ? ? Why ? ? ? Despite all that i think Christensen did a bad job , but that doe n't really count for me ... those mistake and stupid thing i wrote about above are the problem . I watched this movie with some friend and we all were VERY disappointed ... As i said , one of the worst movie i have ever seen ... Just do n't watch it ; )",0
"This is a great off-the-wall romantic comedy about love , work , pandering to the public taste , and midlife crisis . The main character is a talented movie director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get himself out of hock with the IRS . It ha an excellent cast , a wide range of humor ( from deadpan to slapstick ) , and fine writing . It 's also a wry send-up of the movie industry . The metacommentary includes several excellent cut between reality and the movie that 's being made , and in some place the film departs from strict realism . The result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor .",1
"For people like me who were born long after the '60s ended , we can only learn about the era through cultural artifact , of which `` Hair '' is one . This is certainly a well done tour de force . One can get a sense of how thing were for the hippie culture . Probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group crash the rich people 's party . As for the movie 's final scene , one might interpret it a the symbolic end of everything that the '60s represented . But no matter how one interprets this movie , it 's important to understand that even though the '60s themselves may have ended , the movement that typified them still exist in small enclave . It 's a time that people wo n't soon forget . Anyway , this movie is one that I definitely recommend . Milos Forman scored another great one here , right between his two masterpiece `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest '' and `` Ragtime '' ( so why did he later make a piece of crap like `` Man on the Moon '' ? ! ) . Starring John Savage , Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo .",1
"I can tell you just how bad this movie is . I wa in the movie and I have n't seen it yet , but I cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk . Especially considering what we did that year . The thing is that they probably over edited it . Especially the scene where my roommate wa snorting coke of the tit of a Mexican prostitute ( they probably should have followed him around ) . We made a few come and go appearance but aside from that I ca n't really remember anything . I wa the MC in a few scene ( from what I 'm told . What I can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who want to be remembered a the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tit to the world ( or the girl that loser lost his virginity to ) . Overall the trip itself wa crazy but people act different once the camera is on them .",1
"Basically , the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing title made by either of the two Scotts ( Ridley and Tony ) . Let 's make it straight , the movie deserved it hype a one of the most stylish actioner/thriller ever made . When it come to disgruntled tragic hero , Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo . Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thriller you can expect . Washington really got very comfortable in the shaky camera and every executing scene in the movie . One would easily be related to his character 's emotion therefore enjoyed all the killing on the road . It 's a success that they created a super-dark Mexico city with a lot of shit happening . One would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in Man On Fire . I do n't know what would the Mexicans think when they watch this ...... Well , let 's face it again . It 's among the best of the Death Wish genre , but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence . It 's a bit annoying that they justify the action of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let Denzel Washington play the `` missing sheep '' type of tragic hero . In the end , they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary . I wa checking on IMDb if the movie wa based on real event for that ...... So that 's for your consideration if you also find the movie 's theme is a little bit phony . At the end , I hope one would not take this movie for real . 8/10 for art direction/editing/cinematographic/Denzel Washington .",1
"I saw this film last night at a `` pre-Code '' film festival , and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head for his introductory close-up , the entire audience gasped . He wa just that beautiful . Cooper 's look aside , this film display Rouben Mamoulian 's directorial artistry to perfection . Wonderful scene-fades , creative camera angle , symbolic allusion -- Mamoulian just keep exploring the directorial medium and coming up with innovation . This wa Sylvia Sidney 's first role in Hollywood , after her success on the New York stage , and she is just a lovely a a Gary Cooper leading lady ought to be . It 's nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she wa given -- so often she look like she 's afraid she 's about to be hit by someone . There are lot of familiar face in this film , including the wonderful Wynne Gibson . Most striking is Guy Kibbee , best known for playing fatuous rich men , a a grinning and mendacious hit-man . There are n't nearly enough of these pre-Code film available on VHS or DVD , so if you ca n't find a pre-Code festival near you , try campaigning Turner Classic Movies for a broadcast ! As for the reviewer who belief Gary Cooper wa too stupid to have dialogue more complex than `` Yep '' or `` Nope , '' he should perhaps consider Coop 's performance in film such a `` Mr Deeds Goes to Town '' or `` Meet John Doe . '' Although heaven know anyone who looked that good should n't have to be smart a well .",1
"This is an amazing movie from 1936 . Although the first hour is n't very interesting ( for the modern viewer ) , the stylish vision of the year 2036 that come afterwords make up for it . However , do n't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accent ( it 's American - but `` 1930s '' American ) make it difficult . Basically , the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional US town called `` Everytown '' . It span from 1936 , when a war is on the horizon , to 2036 , when technology leap forward and creates it own problem . The first one hour is a bit slow - although it 's tough to tell what audience back then would have thought . The event , suspense and visuals are pretty low-key in today 's term . However , when it get to the future , it 's just plain fun to watch . The large set and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat . Unless you have great listening ability , this movie is hard to listen to . I think I understood only 80 % of the dialog . It could use closed-captioning . If you 're a sci-fi fan , this is one of the genre 's classic and is a must see ( well , at least after the first hour ) . For the average viewer , wait until there 's a closed caption version and then watch it if you 're comfortable with movie of this time period .",1
"I started to watch this show by accident , but I love it . The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television , especially for kid show . My five-year-old nephew ( a most child do ) would just stare at people who were in wheelchair or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him . Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say `` Like Pelswick '' and go on with what ever he wa originally doing . And YES the animation is a little crude , but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the Simpsons then this is n't that bad . The `` Genie '' is actually an Angel who is there to help Pelswick learn lesson in life . He CAN NOT walk some else said he could walk some of the time , I 've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked , he is a paraplegic he ha no feeling below his armpit ( he mention it in an episode ) . As for the humor if you can get a copy of the `` Ntalented '' episode , which lampoon boy-bands , you will instantly love this show .",1
"Mel Torme and Victor Borge , in their younger year , serve to make this film interesting - and especially viewing a young Sinatra , on the sunny side of 30 , and definitely conveying that this wa his `` yes , I 'm a popular singer , but hardly an actor yet '' stage . Michele Morgan is an annoying , inane presence , and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal ha always been totally lost on me . Leon Erroll is silly , a always , but overall pretty funny . 7 star of a potential 10 is about the right `` grade , '' because with the combination of it positive aspect , along with the lack of much of a story , and a silly one at that , and the fore-mentioned annoyance - it is overall average at best . Most of the fascination is from the viewing of the three entertainment icon in their early year .",1
"This film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movie that abound . It is about real people making the best of their life . They just happen to be Indian and the main character are in law enforcement . The realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot . The sound track is by BC Smith , who also did the soundtrack for Coyote Waits , and is great . Adam Beach play a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and Wes Studi is the stoic consummately professional detective . There are many other fine either supporting or cameo role by Graham Greene , Tantoo Cardinal , etc . We have also seen Coyote Waits , another adaptation of a Hillerman novel , and we greatly enjoyed it too .",1

"William Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice is about a Jewish moneylender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio , the forfeiter of a debt . The Jewish moneylender , of course , is Shylock and he is given such a towering performance by Al Pacino that even outstanding actor like Jeremy Irons , Joseph Fiennes , and Lynne Collins fade into the background . The film is set in 16th century Venice and director Michael Radford relies on setting , mood , and realism to tell it story , rejecting lavish period costume or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience . Radford slice the play 's three-hour length to a manageable two hour and eight minute and also provides some historical background . In the opening narration , he tell u how Jews came to England , were subject to increasing persecution , and eventually expelled from England . They were forbidden to own property , could make profit only by lending money at interest , and were forced to live in a Venetian `` geto '' , a forerunner of darker event to come . In the film , the merchant Antonio ( Jeremy Irons ) spit upon Shylock in public , yet feel no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducat to help his friend and suggested lover Bassanio ( Joseph Fiennes ) to properly court Portia ( Lynne Collins ) , a wealthy heiress . Though Shylock ha been insulted by Antonio , he agrees to loan the money without interest for three month on the condition that forfeiture of the bond grant him the right to exact a pound of flesh from Antonio 's heart . The play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge , but like many of Shakespeare 's work there are touch of broad comedy a well . Here the comedy involves three pair of lover : Bassanio and Portia , Gratiano , Bassanio 's friend , and Nerissa , and Lorenzo , another friend of Bassanio , and Jessica , Shylock 's daughter . Portia ha offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three box , made of gold , silver , and lead . The Prince of Morocco chooses the one of gold , the Prince of Aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed . Bassanio , however , love her for herself and open the leaden casket to find the portrait within . Radford 's adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place . Portia 's residence at Belmont suggests one of those splendid summer home complete with immaculate garden and art treasure hanging in every room and contrast well with the grungy look of Shylock 's city with it dank alleyway . When it becomes clear that Antonio can not repay the debt , Bassanio return to Venice , leaving Portia behind . When he arrives , the loan is in default and Shylock is demanding his pound of flesh . Even when Bassanio , backed by Portia 's wealth , offer many time the amount in repayment , Shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of outsider status . The duke , who sits in judgment , will not intervene a Portia enters in the guise a a lawyer to defend Antonio . It is here that the film reach it dramatic height a all party come to court to achieve a final resolution . The Merchant of Venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of Jews from Christian society and their desire for belonging . It ha been one of Shakespeare 's most controversial play and analyst have debated for a long time whether it is an anti-Semitic play or simply a play about anti-Semitism that reflects the prevalent view of Christian society in Elizabethan England . Although Shylock is definitely a caricature , he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indication that Shakespeare view his flaw a human failing , not Jewish one . The Duke recognizes that he is simply a man who ha failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the Torah . In the monologue , `` I am a Jew . Hath not a Jew eye ? If you prick u , do we not bleed ? if you tickle u , do we not laugh ? if you poison u , do we not die ? and if you wrong u , shall we not revenge ? `` , Shylock show a universal humanity , expressing the equality of all men . Though we are horrified at the sentence he wish to carry out , we can feel his pain accumulated over the year . Pacino 's performance brings new vigor to the text and his often over-the-top persona is replaced with a gentler , more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause .. During a Toronto International Film Festival interview last September , Radford said about Pacino , `` when you work with a brilliant actor , you have a great machine . It 's a bit like driving a powerful car . You have to dare to do it . '' He ha dared and we are all the beneficiary .",1
"- Bad Stuff : This movie is real crap . Bad stunt for one thing , they looked so fake I thought this wa `` The Twilight Zone '' . The flashback are pretty much useless . One part of the movie he think taking his anger out on a window will make his life better . I wan na know the casting director and if he wa high because the acting , even from the adult wa horrid . A kissing scene in this movie even sucked . This movie killed the book . The book wa great . I highly do not recommend this movie . Not even for educational purpose . - Good Stuff : I do n't know what I can say really . There is some suspense part that get you going , but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting . - My Verdict : Do not watch .",0
"I would not have known about this film if not for it `` surprise '' Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature film . Thankfully , it came to pas that I wa able to watch this animated little treasure . The story is about the child Brendan who wa the nephew of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of the township of Kells . The main pre-occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings . One day , Aiden , the renowned illustrator from Iona , sought refuge with them . Aiden open Brendan 's eye to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world . Along the way , Brendan befriended the white forest sprite Aisling , a he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration . `` The Secret of Kells '' is unlike most of the animation released these day . It is a throwback of sort a the illustration are done in stark geometric line and design without much care for realism , a much a symbolism . The movement of these line are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of `` Kung Fu Panda . '' However , it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience . The red used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting . Try to catch this quiet gem of a film . It is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such a `` Monsters vs. Aliens '' and the like . The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film . OK , the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting . I would have liked to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden wa working on . But the clear star of this film is clearly it amazing stylized artwork , said to be based on the artwork in the real Book of Kells .",1

The sixty wa before my time but surely if you ` ve got the choice between hippy chick and bored house wife it ` s not really a choice at all . Mind you a lot of people took LSD in those day so I guess that explains it I feel the major problem of A WALK ON THE MOON come down to the fact it ` s a romantic drama at heart ( Just like you ` d expect in a TVM ) with several cloying coming of age scene so why include a fairly explicit sex scene ? It jar with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal woman who were 20 something in 1969 . I say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scene and those teenager will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and Woodstock . In other word A WALK ON THE MOON try to attract many type of audience but will probably appeal to none of them",0
"Even longtime Shirley fan may be surprised by `` Now and Forever . '' The movie wa filmed with Paramount studio  not with Shirley 's parent company Twentieth Century Fox  in 1934 , before Fox producer Darryl Zanuck had perfected the successful Shirley formula ( cute song , cold heart for her to melt , young couple for her to play cupid to , happy ending ) . Thus `` Now and Forever '' fall into the category of a Shirley vehicle without the standard Shirley story . It is an awkward position for any movie , but this impressive , talented cast make it work . Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star a fun-loving , irresponsible con artist Jerry and Toni Day . The only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart . When they are suddenly landed with custody of Jerry 's young daughter Penny ( Shirley Temple ) , it is Toni  and not Penny , a many believe  who persuades Jerry to give up his criminal career . But Jerry flounder at his desk job , and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family , he soon return to thieving and dishonesty . In a standard Shirley device , Penny try to melt the heart of crusty curmudgeon Felix Evans , the victim of one of Jerry 's con , but her attempt fails , for Evans is revealed to be a con artist himself , and he blackmail Jerry into helping him steal jewel . The drama , gunfight , death , and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for Little Miss Sunshine . There is no happy ending , no dancing , and only one song sequence ( the cute number `` The World Owes Me a Living '' ) . But this doe not mean that Shirley fan should avoid `` Now and Forever . '' Rather , it 's divergence from the usual Shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other film . But beware : You should avoid colorized version of this film , and see it in black-and-white if you can . The color is bright , garish , and unrealistic , and in many scene , Shirley 's famous curl are actually red instead of blonde . Yikes !",1
"I , too , found `` Oppenheimer '' to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offering ever on American PBS . David Suchet wa particularly effective a Edward Teller , a I recall , and the overall conception wa spectacularly good . The only reason that the series doe n't rate a full 10/10 is for the low-budget production value in some area . Actual content is absolutely first-rate in my recollection . The Oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the UK on July 31st ! It will be a Region 2/PAL set , but it would seem that a Region 1/NTSC set should be soon in the offing . If you have a universal player in the US , you can order the series right now from Amazon UK . http : //tinyurl.com/znyyq Huzzah ! !",1
"This film is stunningly beautiful . Goldsworthy 's art really benefit with the medium of film because you can see the art at it most beautiful , moving and changing and blossoming . I strongly recommend this movie to everyone . I can think of nothing else to say about it . It 's just the kind of movie you HAVE TO see , because it 's so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when I left the theatre .",1

This is the second film I 've seen of Ida Lupino a a director after 53 's the hitch-hiker . I think this one wa a better film then that one . This one ha a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doe n't like everyone looking and talking about her so she run away and and is taken in by a family . I think Leonard Maltin 's review is right only to give it 2 and 1/2 star .,1
"It seems like more consideration ha gone into the IMDb review of this film than went into the source . Here 's a review without pretension : Just when you think nothing is going to happen , it doe n't . Dress it up any way you like , this is a dull film , full of unengaging character doing very little of interest . One to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you 're like , so deep , man . Not something to watch for your own pleasure though . Unless . You 're . Pretentious .",0

"* review may contain spoiler * predictable , campy , bad special effect . it ha a TV-movie feeling to it . the idea of the UN a being taken over by Satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible . the premise is interesting , but it excution fall waaaay short . if you want to convert people to Christianity with a film like this , at least make it a quality one ! i wa seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck . ca n't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago , and there is n't really much to say about this film other than ..... skip it !",0
"I saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it wa fantastic . It doe well in portraying issue that the average High School student is subjected to .

Its a Fantastic Aussie Film . Go see it . Support it . Learn from it .",1
"The Bone Snatcher is about a group miner who go on a search for a missing crew of miner in the Namib Desert . When the find them , they are nothing more than bone stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hour . The story keep you interested a to what exactly caused this . The character are well enough , and the acting is pretty good . About an hour and ten minute in when you find out what is causing the bone to be stripped clean , you sigh `` oh , that is really stupid . '' The movie is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting ending . Up until that point , the movie wa pretty good , and it is a shame that it took such a bad turn . So I can not recommend this movie . I gave it a 4/10 .",0
"I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie . That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at the movie . I LOVE the original and have seen it several time and recommend it to everyone . This may have been the problem but I do not think so , because there were a couple of bright spot that showed if done right they could have made this movie work . Bette wa under used and Anne wa over used and miscast . I do not know why English or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition . They billed this a a Sex in the City but better ? Not a chance I liked Sex in the City a lot and wa disappointed by this movie . So do not waste your money on this movie - go see anything but this !",0
"While credited a a Tom and Jerry cartoon , this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in . While the dialect humor is mostly lame , there is a brief musical sequence involving `` black skeleton '' that wa entertaining . I have to ask however , how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of time ? One of many entry produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney . Only worth seeing if you 're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicity were stereotyped a entertainment way back when .",0
"Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view . The plot is pretty much foreseeable , the character are stereotype , the editing too exaggerated . Anyway , the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambition . Instead , I think this is a straight commercial thing . Including a character from the french part of Switzerland ( the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band 's called SENS UNIK ) seems to aim to a larger audience . A straight German-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa . What really got on my nerve were the product placement all over the movie . Sometines scene remembered of advertisement clip ! I also think the topic of `` young people taking drug without any other target in their life '' is a wide spread reality in Zurich . Therefore , it should be elaborated with more care . I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White , in order that his next movie is gon na show his true artistic skill .",0
"What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivor . They must eat bug and insect , or whatever , after a poison war , or something , ha nearly wiped out all human civilization . In these dark time , one of the few people on Earth still able to live in comfort , we will call him the All Knowing Big Boss , ha a great quest to prevent some secret spore seed from being released into the air . It seems that the All Knowing Big Boss is the last person on Earth that know that these spore even exist . The spore are located far away from any living soul , and they are highly protected by many layer of deadly defense system . The All Knowing Big Boss want the secret spore to remain in their secret protected container . So , he make a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore container from all of the protective system and secret location . Sending people to the location of secret spore make them no longer a secret . Sending people to disable all of the protective system make it possible for the spore to be easily released into the air . How about letting sleeping dog lie ? ! The one pleasant feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu . As the unremarkable macho action team member drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing , engaging Vivian Wu 's charm make acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much . She is an object of love , an object of desire -- a very believable concept ! Fans of Vivian Wu may want to check out an outstanding B-movie she is in from a couple year back called DINNER RUSH . DINNER RUSH is highly recommended . ENCRYPT is not .",0
"Hayao Miyazaki 's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea , his latest animated film , which turn on the usual sweetness to charm your sock off . I thought that the trailer featured it song which wa quietly hypnotic , and I did n't have to wait for an invite to make sure I got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie , scheduled to open here next week . For fan of Studio Ghibli film , you 'll probably know what you 're in for , a Miyazaki ha yet another winner in his filmography , that will win new fan over . I 'm embarrassed to say the least that I 've so far watched only My Neighbour Totoro ( eye that pile of Ghibli DVDs ) and love it to bit , but I guess this would serve a a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated film that I would enjoy . Ponyo ( voiced by Nara Yuria ) is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea , with her constant foray in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek . Nonetheless these ambition do not bode well with her humanoid dad Fujimoto ( Tokoro Joji ) , who harbour some hatred toward the human race for pollution , and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection / revenge by Mother Nature a well . An accident one day see Ponyo being washed ashore , and picked up by five year old boy Sosuke ( Doi Hiroki ) who life on a house on the said cliff with his mother Lisa ( Yamaguchi Tomoko ) , while dad Koichi ( Nagashima Kazushige ) is mostly out to sea since he 's a sailor . And you can expect some moment of throwback to the like of The Little Mermaid , or Splash made for kid . Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun . The artwork here is still simply astounding even though it 's in 2D glory , knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on . There are so many thing going on at the same time within the same frame , that you 'll probably be game for repeated viewing just to spot them all . This definitely beat any 3D or CG animated production any day given it beauty coming from it simplicity , and not only from the artwork department , but on it story too , despite complaint coming in that it took a leaf from the Hans Christian Andersen classic . While there are avenue to make this film extremely dark , it only suggested certain dark theme , but opted instead for a film with more positive emotion , suitable for both kid and adult alike . At it core , it about love , that between the family member of Koichi , Lisa and Sosuke , and especially between mother and son . More so , it 's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened Ponyo , and I tell you Ponyo herself ha enough cuteness in her to beat the like of Bolt , WallE and Eve all hand down . Characterization here is top notch , and it 's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo , in whichever form adopted , especially when she 's such a playful being who doe n't hide her emotion - if she 's upset with you , either she turn away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face ! Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shoo-in to my top film of this year without hesitation . And the next time I go to Tokyo , I 'm sure a hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to u by Hayao Miyazaki . Highly recommended film , so do n't you go missing this on the big screen !",1
"Michael Dudikoff star a Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fight ninja who are stealing weapon from the U.S Army , in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial art actioner , which is hampered by too many long pause without action , but helped by some high energy action setpieces a well a Steve James ' performance .",0
"Masayuki Suo , who directed this fine film , is on a role . After the decent `` Fancy Dance '' and the classic ( in Japan , anyway ) college-sumo comedy `` Shiko Funjatta '' , Suo ha followed his own huge footstep with a smashing success . The story is engaging . We both laugh often ( Naoto Takenaka is hilarious , a he is in Suo 's two previous film ) and really root for the character . But to me the big bonus is the look this movie give the viewer into Japanese society - real life in Japan . Suo ha a knack for showing real-life activity with entertaining flair . The result is a movie that will pull you in , make you laugh , make you think , and both entertain you and give you insight into today 's Japan . Also look for the the main 8 actor from Shiko Funjatta , a they all appear again in various role , from supporting character ( Takenaka ) to short cameo ( many ) .",1
"The synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the convention of the society in with she life . I like strong female character and expected a movie much along the line of `` Chocolat '' with a le fairy tale and more bite . What I got wa a cast of despicable character . For a character-driven movie to be effective , I need to feel a connection or compassion for the people . There wa no one with whom I could relate in the movie . Grazia ( Golino , whose work I admired in `` Rain Man '' ) portrays a mentally ill , probably bipolar , female that is often rude , aggressive and violent . Her husband bicker and yell , when he is not hitting or slapping someone . The child are rude brat . They yell at each other and the female in the movie . They attack other child with no provocation . Violence begets violence . This seems to be an island of unfeeling , aggressive , violent and rude people all the way around . The direction is not compelling . There are intermixed scene that attempt to be art , but instead bore the viewer . The location is exceptionally gorgeous , but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film . I would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie .",0
"I saw this film without knowing much about it at all . The split screen device wa immediately irritating , and thing did n't improve for me after the title sequence had finished . The plot , character and dialogue were all extremely cliched - poor guy from abusive family get thrown out of home , want to get out of his 'lot ' , reinvents himself , change his voice , dress in others ' clothes , is adopted by a gay man who he proceeds to disgard on his way up to becoming part of an international set of drug taking British aristocrat . The estate of Patricia Highsmith ( talented mr ripley ) should be suing the maker of this film . The triple screen to me , together with the over 120 min duration , emphasis the almost non existent editing . Ca n't decide which image work and is the most powerful , why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them . This gimmick removed any connection or interest I had with any of the character . Important dialogue wa repeated 3 time across each screen , a if to say 'this is an important / moving / deep moment , ok ! ' . Do n't waste your time .",0
"I do n't usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time I feel I have to . I have spoken of taste in another review , saying it 's all in the eye of the beholder but when it come to this film , if you like it , it simply mean you have bad taste . I love film . I loved `` Isle of the Dead '' which is pretty much an unknown B & W film . I even liked `` Scream '' and `` Scary Movie '' I liked these film because they have , if not a lot , at least something good about them . I appreciate 99.9 % of the film I 've seen because they tell a story which I have n't heard before , and most director only make film with a good storyline . Throughout this film I wa thinking `` Where is this going ? '' ( even near the end ) `` Where did they get these awful actor from '' ? `` Was that supposed to be a joke ? '' and suchlike . With the obvious twist looming I wa sceptical , but hoped it would perhaps `` make '' the film and prove I had n't wasted my time . I wa sadly mistaken . The storyline wa bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there wa . Here 's a rundown : Storyline  much like the first film , which wa alright , this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the character or the situation . The situation are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable . The twist wa terrible , it did n't make me feel a thing , like excitement or WOW . Just `` My GOD . '' There wa nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think `` Oooo wa n't that clever '' because it wa n't . In `` Fight Club '' there are flashback at the end showing bit where Tyler 's true identity wa cryptically shown , and when you watched it again you saw more , it really wa a work of genius , how it wa written , laid out and directed . This wa a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist . I think it wa `` wild thing '' that had like a pretty poor double twist and I still liked the film because the rest wa OK and it wa n't trying too hard to be a big twist . Its like the CI2 writer thought it wa gon na be the best twist ever . But really , it just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end . The film ended almost immediately afterward , with the whole film void by Sebastian 's whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced , paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl . Acting  the actor in this film are appalling . Almost a bad a `` Sunset Beach . '' - Extremely corny and badly performed . It 's not even so bad it 's good like `` Hunk '' . The worst acting I thought came from Amy Adams who played Kathryn , it wa a rigid , pathetic and badly thought out performance by her . Robin Dunne wa also poor . I have n't seen `` American Psycho II '' yet , but no doubt his laid back `` cool '' style ha ruined that film also . I ca n't even say it is a good film for teen , a it not . If my son or daughter liked this film I 'd be ashamed . But they would n't anyway , a they would take into consideration all the thing that make a good film , which this film ha none of . Really . I 'm disappointed that some have said `` you might not be in the age bracket for this film , and so dislike it '' I like all the film now that I liked a a teen and had very good taste . Also , do you really think that when you reach 20+ you suddenly do n't like any teenish story line ? No . I liked `` Mean Girls '' and other generic teen film , and watch `` Beverly Hills 90210 '' all the time . There 's no excuse for poor directing , acting and screenplay I 'm afraid . Besides , I wa 16/17 when I first watched it . If anything , being older just make you a better judge of a terrible film . I ca n't believe anyone can give it 10/10 either , one of my favourite film is `` Memento '' and I gave it 9 a I know there can be better . It is a shame for this site that people do that , give 10 flippantly , or do n't get the films/show , and so give it 2 . Anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste , and perhaps their life , and with this realise that this is the worst film EVER made . ( worse than `` Loch Ness '' ) If you are n't a teenager with bad taste , or simply do n't have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film .",0
"This movie had the potential to be really good , considering some of the plot element are borrowed from the sci-fi actioner THE HIDDEN . And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his role . But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one . Dolph play a butt-kicking monk ( ! ) who travel to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that ha imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 year . He must battle the minion , who is a spirit that jump from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL . The minion , naturally , want the key so it can let the antichrist out . Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minion-possessed body . If I 'm making this sound entertaining , forget it . The pacing is very awkward and sluggish , the acting subpar at best , and the fight scene staged poorly . Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spout some of the worst dialogue of his career . The cheese factor really pick up at the end when the minion battle an army of machine-gun wielding monk at the monastery , but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest . Too bad , I really wanted to like this .",0
"Barbra Streisand 's first television special wa simply fantastic ! From her skit a a child to her medley of song in a high-fashion department store -- everything wa top-notch ! It wa easy to understand how this special received award . Not muddled down by guest appearance , the focus remained on Barbra thoughout the entire production .",1
"The promotion for `` Clubbed '' project a slick looking film based around the clubbing scene of the 1980 's . What we end up with is a film with identity issue . The sub-plots end up taking over from what viewer would assume to be the main plot , so the focus on this film being mainly about `` clubbing '' end up being left in the gutter . Boxing , depression , self-loathing , gangster , bouncer and drug-deals , are all hastily crammed into 90 odd minute . On no le than 4 occasion I had to check the run-time of the film , a the worry grew that this film wa bound to disappoint . What club scene we do see are bland and repetitive , featuring approximately 3 extra dancing in what is barely recognisable a a `` club '' , hardly capturing the vibe of the day . If you 're looking for a film about the 80 's club scene , something along the line of what `` Human Traffic '' did for the late 90 's , forget `` Clubbed '' .",0
"I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there . I 've seen a ton of movie over the holiday and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did . There is just something way cool about the actor and the way that they put the film together . It 's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f * * * * ing hilarious black humour . Franco is great but the older rough dude steal the show in a few scene , like when he punch the kid out in the dirt grave . I guess some politically correctos wo n't appreciate the vibe ( do n't bring your grandma ) but it is totally awesome . The thing that 's best is the kaliedescope style . There is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road . The movie really make you sad and scared in part but it also spin your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed . WTF is up with the world ? Sooo many critic are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary ground-breaking film and when you see them they 're boring and predictable and not-all-that . I do n't get it because there are a lot of other better choice . Blind Spot is really kinda great because it give you thrill and chill and major upcoming star power but doe it in a way that is completely fresh and definitely totally rad .",1
"I am surprised at IMDb 's low rating of this movie . With all due respect , it low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poor . They would rather see a movie with cheap thrill , a bigger budget , and more gore . The first misconception by people is that this is a horror film . It is not , nor doe the film mislead you into believing it is one . It is a psychological thriller . It is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie . Reel.com 's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie . All the other negative review doe n't make much sense . It 's almost a if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it . I will reveal some spoiler for the moron who said it wa boring and did n't make sense . Martha wa brainwashing herself and performing experiment on herself to be a caring mother while she really wa an evil Nazi who would kill without warning . The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing , we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film 's direction and writing . I definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6 's range on originality alone . I recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the IQ scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch Scream or Freddy 's Nightmare . Kudos to the acting a well . For such a low budget film , you are amazed that this movie did n't hit your local cinema with the great direction , writing , and acting . Please do n't be fooled by the rating by IMDb . This movie is worth it . I actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice .",1
"A humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business . It 's easy watching , and even offer Blethyn & Molina stealing a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie . Walken is over the top a a zealous competitor of Molina in the undertaking business , trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh town . We see a couple of very funny example of the `` new style '' . The plot thickens with Pugh having an affair with Watts , and her suggesting that they do Blethyn in . Meanwhile Molina ha rekindled his long suffering romantic feeling for Blethyn , and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the South Seas , and dance away their day together .

"Man 's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlement on vacant land and park that during these time were called 'Hoovervilles ' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration . The proposition of this film is that a man 's home is still his castle even when it 's just a shack in a Hooverville . Spencer Tracy ha such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good time would not be working all that much . But in a part very typical for Tracy before he wa cast a a priest in San Francisco , the start of a slew of classic role , he 's playing a tough good natured mug who take in Loretta Young . One of the thing about Man 's Castle is that it show the effect of the Depression on woman a well a men . Women had some additional strain put on them , if men had trouble finding work , woman had it twice a hard . And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal . Spence take Loretta Young in who 's facing those kind of problem and make no demand on her in his castle . Pretty soon though they 're in love , though Tracy is not the kind to settle down . The love scene had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man 's Castle . And both were Catholic and married and in those day that wa an insuperable barrier to marriage . Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously . Also in the cast are Walter Connolly a a kind of father figure for the whole camp , Marjorie Rambeau who 's been through all the pitfall Young might encounter and try to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl , a really loathsome creep who ha his eye on Young a well . Hohl brings the plot of Man 's Castle to it climax through his scheming . Man 's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression , not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment .",1
"Janeane Garofalo ha been very public in her displeasure about this film , calling it , among other thing , anti-feminist . She ha also said on her radio show she hate making `` romantic comedy '' because she doe n't believe in them . I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here . This film is a trifle at best . She doe her best , but overall , it wa just another boring , unbelievable `` romantic comedy '' that ha no basis in the real world . Whereas there will be some who will say `` suspend your disbelief '' , one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood . Janeane 's character , for some reason , is usually filmed in shadow and darkness , which make her look unattractive , while Uma 's character is filmed in lighter tone ( which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reason she detests this film ) . That really hurt the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two . As many have said here and on other comment thread , Janeane is not ugly , but in fact , quite beautiful . I have n't read one review where someone said Uma wa better looking . Having said that though , I believe that Ben Chaplin 's character would more than likely stay with Uma , not Janeane . Many men do n't like really intelligent woman ( and many woman do n't like really intelligent men ) , and sadly , Ben probably would have stayed with Uma . And despite the director 's attempt to make Janeane unattractive , it doe n't work . Her natural beauty come through anyway . I think a lot of Janeane 's male fan who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character , and actually scoring with Janeane . Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she play here ( real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine ) , so take a cold shower gentleman . This is the role that Janeane is best known for , and that 's a shame , a this really is n't that good of a film .",0
"This film really deserves more recognition than it getting . It really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood tie , favour and allegiance within the crime world . The film is shot beautifully and delf into all you 're classic crime theme such a betrayal and power . This film is a movie goer film , it requires attention and understanding and reward fully in the end . It is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting , martial art epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china . It feature an arrangement of great character , actor and development although is fair to say I had to watch it twice just to nail what wa happening with some of the character due to their being so many interaction in the film . ALl in all 8/10 Great plot character but there are character that do n't stand out enough and the music did n't really get me going and at time i felt it did n't sync well with the action ( there is action by the way ) so it loses some point for that .",1
"While there are n't any talking animal , big lavish song production number , or villians with half white / half black hair ... it doe have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance , and Walt & Roy did in their era with the studio .

"I do n't know what that other guy wa thinking . The fact that this movie wa independently made make it no le terrible . You can be a big a believer a you want ... the majority of this film is mindless drivel . I feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minute of it . And that alone wa no small feat . Not only is the acting terrible , but the plot is never even close to developed . There are countless hole in the story , to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore . I 've never read the book , so I ca n't critique on that , but this is the first review that I 've written here and it 's purpose is solely to save all you viewer out there an hour and a half of your life . I ca n't remember the last time I could n't even finish watching a movie . This one really take the cake .",0

Its really funny that she want to go into politics & that they 're highlighting her 'scheming talent . ' I loved Calvin 's new haircut ! It make him look more mature . They should shave Cappy 's head , a well . All the guy are hot but Calvin is definitely the hottest ! I cant wait to see more of him !

"I 'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor , sorry for that ... This is one of those little known movie that play only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air . I wa browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title , I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10 , that 's pretty decent . I must admit that it 's a very well put together movie and that 's why I 'm puzzled . This is the only film made by this director ... ? How come he did n't make lot of film after this rather good one ... ? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie , ha ha ; - ) Anyway , I really would like to see that he pull his act together and make another good movie like this one , please ..... ?",1
If you watched this film for the nudity ( a I did ) you wo n't be disappointed . I could have done without the bumbling crook or the bear though . Some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it wa I think H.O.T.S . ha to be the best of it genre . It is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these time . I would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot point any day . It is a shame that the DVD doe n't have any extra but a they did n't have DVDs when this wa filmed that is understandable . I would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end .,1
"McConaughey in a horror/thriller ? I had to see this . I wa pleasantly surprised . The plot is told in flashback mode , and it concern an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament . I ca n't say much more without spoiling the whole movie , sorry . Just know that if you decide to watch it , you 'll be , in the very least , surprised . All the main player are very good . Bill Paxton did a great job directing those kid , and his acting is awesome . McConaughey 's acting is solid throughout and fit the bill perfectly . This movie challenge you to think . Is Dad crazy ? Is there a God ? Do Demons exist ? How far would you go to right a wrong . And what is `` right '' anyway ? I 'm still thinking . And thus I recommend `` Frailty '' . 7/10 and this is one of those movie that deserves and reward a second , or even third viewing .",1
"There are several thing wrong with this movie- Brenda Song 's character being one of them . I do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor- I honestly do n't . I believe she is given poor line . She is just supposed to be , `` that vain , rich girl '' , and while it is funny in the TV show she play in , it ca n't even get a dry laugh from me here . Either way , I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this film . The movie wa not that terrible ... initially . Wendy 's reaction to Shen wa completely natural . I mean , how would you feel if a man , claiming to be a reincarnated monk , chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight `` the great evil '' and save the world ? Which brings me to another point . I know this movie is entirely fiction , but it is still ha a founding in Chinese culture . It seems like all of the `` warrior '' in Wendy 's family line were woman . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I doubt that the monk would 've just been okay with that . Sure , maybe they could 've worked it in somehow , but they offered no explanation whatsoever . By doing so , they just contributed to the many cheesy attempt at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the medium . Nevermind that , however- let u continue . Wendy 's character becomes more unbearable a the film go on . Yes , she is a teenager , and it is near homecoming- I mean , who want to fight evil during homecoming ? The problem is , when `` the evil '' start to manifest himself , Wendy doe not seem a freaked out a she should be . She is extremely careless- even for someone like her . She continues not to care about her training . I will use this conversation a an example , Shen : `` If you do not win this battle , evil will take over , and everything good will be gone . '' Wendy : `` Whoa , talk about pressure . Well ... let 's talk about something else . '' Yes , let 's Wendy . Let 's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training . Of course Shen let her , but his character ha an excuse . Better that he cooperate with her , than that he not , and she not train at all , and get them both killed . Oh , speaking of which . Shen also told Wendy that it wa his destiny for him to die for her in battle , a he had for her great-grandmother ( I am assuming that part ) . This make Wendy 's action more unforgivable . As the script-writer would have it , Wendy 's homecoming and this `` great battle '' are on exactly the same day . Do you know what Wendy doe ? Do you even have to guess ? Yes , she doe end up going to the battle , for when she try to leave for homecoming , the monk , ( who Shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teacher because she `` felt weird fighting an old man '' ) inform her that Shen ha gone to battle alone , so she go to save him . We initially see some half-decent fighting , that is actually entertaining . Until finally , the great evil come out of Wendy 's rival-for-homecoming 's body , and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken piece of the body of his ancient warrior . Do n't ask . Anyway , Wendy get all `` panicky . '' Then Shen go and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name- and manages to get himself killed . Wendy catch Shen a he make his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air . She scream title of said article out . Now ... it wa bad enough that Wendy became powerful far , far too fast . No , I will not let it be excused because it wa her `` destiny '' and she had `` the power within '' her . Since when , though , did she learn healing ? No , worst ... since when could she resurrect people ? So Shen is raised from the dead . Then , Wendy and he fight the guy . He loses way to easily . The worst part , is when they jump together , and kick him at the same time , and he is banished forever . Then the monk commend Wendy on her sacrifice . Two thing , # 1 : Do n't the script writer and director know a battle need a little more `` finesse '' to it ? # 2 : What sacrifice ? The fact that she did n't go to homecoming ? Because the girl did not break a sweat , or even bleed . I mean , come on now , this movie wa TV PG , I wanted to see somebody get hurt . Ah-hem ... moving on . I know it sound like maybe I should have given the movie a one , based on my comment . Part of critique , you must know , though , is breaking a thing down . You do n't necessarily try to look for the bad , but if it 's there , you bring attention to it . This movie ha a lot of bad , but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place . So , I suppose it wa all right . Not that me not saying it wa n't all right would 've stopped anybody from watching it .",0
"I liked this a lot . The camera angle are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch . And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see thing from Kane 's point of view . Lots of fun . Plenty of people were shouting at the screen ! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotion . He 's a lot le one-dimensional than most horror hero . Kane is a lot le scary and more believable than most movie psycho . It wa not clear to me how he would react to various situation . There are not many twist here , but it is clever and original in it 's own way . Good , creepy , B-movie slasher fare .",1
"It wa a decent movie , I actually kind of enjoyed it . But the ending is so abrupt ! ! There is absolutely no closure and it leaf ton of loose end . What happens after the concert ? What happens with her boyfriend ? Does she hook up with Grant ? Does she come beck in the next semester ? And what about Angela ? Obviously Holly 's performance would knock Angela down a few peg , but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts . There is so much left up in the air and it 's very unsatisfying . I do n't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something , but it is a terrible ending and I think that it really make the movie a joke . I wa very disappointed .",0
"This is a great horror film for people who do n't want all that vomit-retching gore and sensationalism . This movie ha equal amount of horror , suspense , humor , and even a little light nudity , but nothing big . Linnea Quigley is n't over the top a she wa in `` Return of the Living Dead '' where she danced naked on a crypt , but she is still essentially the same slutty character . Cathy Podewell is a virginal and chaste character before going on to `` Dallas , '' and we are also introduced to Amelia [ soon Mimi ] Kinkade , the sexy and sinister would-be dark matron of the house . As she and Linnea are possessed and take over the house , they reanimate the body of their dead friend to scare the limit out of the survivor . I 've heard a lot of people compare this movie to `` The Evil Dead , '' but if anything , this movie is a rival to that one the same way Freddie rivaled Jason.This movie series though is far superior to that one !",1
"i wa looking forward to this , and to be honest there were some bright spot , but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world . The many dog were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine fascist pompously whining ( ; - ) ) on about their achievement . I felt it would have worked better a an hour long TV documentary , concentrating on one of the many different issue it explored . The most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an American wine company 's campaign to get rid of the historic forest . A socialist mayor agreed to a deal , a nicely timed election arrived , and a communist mayor wa elected , who turned it down , much to the exasperation of the American wine exec ... hopefully the director 's cut will be shorter than the original ..",0
"When I rented this movie I thought I wa going to see a horror-movie . However , there is little horror in this typical seventy mystery-drama directed by strange James T. Flocker .

"What about Scream Baby Scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it ? I bought it because , God help me , I 'm a sucker for old B-cinema even a worthless a this . Nonetheless , Something about this movie irritates me , it 's probably Janet , Janet come off cold & snooty , seemingly , with the intention of coming off a deep and noble , with a look on her face that scream constipation , she ca n't seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend want . I 'm glad that this is her only role . What really irritates me is that this is a 1960 's gore film gone terribly awry , and a we all know , awry is Floridian for `` zero gore '' . It 's like the director started with a Herschell Lewis style but backed out of the gore scene when his wife found out , so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other , and basically , a whole lot of irritating nothing . In other word , we end up with Florida Bore . Joseph Adler should be embarrassed . Janets boyfriend , Jason is almost a ridiculous a she is , this guy ha something negative to say about absolutely everything , come to think of it , he 's probably the least likable good guy in horror history . The only thing this movie really ha going for it is that it carry that 60's/early 70 's B-gore vibe that you can find in stuff like Undertaker & his pal , Blood Freak , or most anything from Herschell Lewis . Even Rodney from the Gruesome Twosome is in this , I Ithought his caveman comedy routine wa irritating , most everything from reel to reel is stupid , even the trip scene wa stupid . The only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery , but that mostly includes Janet whining about life not being perfect . In the only real ironic twist , Scream Baby Scream get even le interesting once the story finally get started , around the 45 minute mark . If you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable , but are offended by the color red , you might not hate this . Why doe Troma distribute this ? Would n't this be Something Weird Video 's area ? Scream Baby Scream very well may be the worst in Florida horror/gore of it era , but , I suppose , underneath the unlikeable character , and the incoherent plot , lie potential . Scream , Baby , Scream really just seems like it should follow the Blood Feast pattern , so , to steal a quote from Janet , `` If it doe n't fit , I throw it out '' . 2/10",0
"I recently viewed a copy of this ( under the title 'Eaten Alive ' ) Talk about dreadful ! Any movie Ed Wood ever put out look like Oscar material compared to this laughable tosh . To be fair a couple of line from the script will live long in the memory such a `` These people ( Cannibals ) do n't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like u , they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me '' Classic ! The mad 'Jonesville ' type leader out in the jungle wa the best character in the film , he really did look like a nutter . I think he wa the only actor not to be dubbed in ( badly ) , if these Italians must have American character in their film why dont they get Americans to dub in the dialogue instead of English people trying their best to sound like Annie Oakley . I 'll give this 3 out of 10 , I 'll give it three because it really is funnier than most comedy out these day .",0
"The photography is accomplished , the acting is quite good , but in virtually every other department The Greek Tycoon is a dreary bore . Taking it inspiration from the real-life love affair of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis , the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on TV all day long . Viewers who embrace the whole `` celebrity magazine culture '' ( paparazzo photograph and gossipy story about the rich and famous ) will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here . But those who prefer film with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a butt-numbing slog . American president James Cassidy ( James Franciscus ) and his beautiful wife Liz ( Jacqueline Bisset ) are in Greece on official business . A ridiculously wealthy Greek shipping tycoon , Theo Tomasis ( Anthony Quinn ) , catch sight of Liz at a party at his elegant manor . Despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else , there is an immediate attraction between them . Later , at a private party aboard his yacht , Tomasis make his desire known to Liz . Some while later , President Cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach . Liz is shocked and saddened by his death , but it is n't long before she seek comfort in the arm of her Greek lover Tomasis . Eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world 's newspaper , magazine , photographer and wag . It is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producer of this film denied that it wa a dramatisation of the Kennedy-Onassis story . They wanted the film to be seen a an original story , rooted in fiction . But anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing it inspiration . Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew The Greek Tycoon amounted to his love-life getting the Hollywood treatment ( if rumour are to be believed , he actually had a hand in approving Anthony Quinn for the Tomasis role ! ) J. Lee-Thompson is n't really the right sort of director for this type of movie  he 's better suited to action fodder like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex  but he marshal the proceeding with an uninspired , professional adequacy . Quinn is very watchable a Tomasis ; Bisset look lovely a the object of his desire ; Franciscus us his toothy smile and a façade of integrity to make for a believable politician . Their performance are good on the surface , but there 's little for the actor to do on any deeper level . Similarly , Tony Richmond 's photography give the film an elegant surface sheen a it move from one exotic locale to the next , but the merest of scratch prof that there 's nothing behind the film 's glossy exterior .",0
"Living in Edinburgh , and have a great thirst for history , I wa very put off by the `` liberty '' taken . Wrong breed of dog for a start ! ! Bobbys owner Old Jock wa an old single man , who came to Edinburgh and died a pauper in lodging , not like in the film at all . For anyone coming to Edinburgh and hoping to see sight of the film , you will not find the graveyard in Princes St Gardens ! ! There were a few moment were a tissue would have been great . The actor were fantastic at padding out a rather flimsy script . I do n't feel the poor wee Bobby actually got enough screen time , possibly due to being `` lost '' at one point . All that said , the film wa fine and any 8 yr old will enjoy .",0
"ONE DARK NIGHT is a highly overlooked and little known film from the early 80 's that deserves an audience that I fear it will never get , and that 's a damn shame . I have seen this film compared to others that have gotten a bigger name over the year , most notably PHANTASM , HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM . This is a much different film than those and I do n't see the comparison other than the mausoleum , which is a bit similar to the one in PHANTASM , but not enough to make any real comparison . I 'm not sure how this one slipped through without a broader acceptance . Maybe it 's all in the marketing , I do n't know . Perhaps a remake would breathe new life into it , unless Raymar drained all the life out of it that is . I 'm not too big on all the remake that are abundant these day , but I think they do work well with lesser known film ( except for the awful GHOST SHIP remake , which other than the opening scene and Mudvayne 's Not Falling blaring , wa utter crap ) . So if a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT would happen to fall into the right hand , I think it would make a lot of people go and watch the original . I know that 's what I do if there 's a remake of a film I have n't seen before . So anything short of a remake , I fear , would not bring this film back to life . Unless , of course , Raymar got his eye on it . Anyways , ONE DARK NIGHT is a must see for horror fan , especially 80 's horror fan ( 'cause we all know that 's when the best horror movie were made ) . Creepy setting . Fairly good acting . Very good story . Campy . What more could you want from an early 80 's horror film ? What 's that ... nudity and gore ? Well , sorry . No nudity or gore in this film , but it 's still great nonetheless ! A solid 8 out of 10 . Enjoy .",1
"After a quasi-Gothic , all-fruity music video , the movie start with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself . In a perfect world that would be that and the end credit would roll . We do n't live n that world . The insipid band member decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence . When I say clown , I mean actual clown . He tell them they 're all going to die via Cassidy 's ghost ( the spirit posse Dora , one of the band-mates ) We could n't care le a the character are all boring , vapid , and extremely horribly acted . Written by Adam Hackbarth ( an incredibly apropos surname if there ever wa one ) , and directed by Corbin Timbrook ( who after The attendant , and Tower of blood , HAS to know that he keep making crap for a living ) , this movie s a constant battle between the film 's incompetence and the viewer 's need to stay awake . Not enough blood to appease gore-hounds , nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs . This movie in fact ha absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone .

"If you love drive-in cheeze from the early '70s you will just love this one.How could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum ? You ca n't ! Crazy folk and sharp object are always an entertaining combination . The film look like it wa shot inside someone 's house for about $ 320.65 . For me that just ad to the fun of watching this type of stuff.The gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilk , but there is enough to keep u bloodthirsty sickos ( like myself ) happy.Some horror film drag in part and leave you waiting for something to happen.That 's not the case here.The character are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyable.There is never a dull moment from start to finish.The mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable . I liked it so much that right after the end credit I watched it a second time.It 's an absolute must see for any self respecting drive-in horror nut . 9.5/10 on the Drive-in-Freak-O-Meter ... required viewing Yea I love you .. I DO love you ... now take your Thorazine and put your clothes back on ... please .... 8 )",1
"This movie is about a very delicate argument and if you are searching for something that make you think here you are right . Tim Robbins ha made a wonderful job and the result is a kind of docu-drama that should be shown in school ( for the strong theme treated ) . What about the actor ? Well , they are simply great ; Susan Sarandon is truly 'the face of love ' and Sean Penn is unbelievable a almost always . An absolutely must-see !",1
"This movie wa made by Daiei Studios , known for it Gamera movie . It is about a samurai lord who wa murdered by one of his own men . He claim his throne , forcing his former 's two child to flee into the wood , where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 year . In those time that passed , the new samurai lord ha proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley . Therefore , it seems that the good people 's only hope is the stone statue , which is where a demon god sleep ; they want the god to help them . This samurai movie brings to u traditional Japanese aspect including sword-fights , geisha and worshiper . It is a superb and powerful story of survival and hope , with the protagonist attempting to triumph over pure evil . It is full of excitement , particularly the part where the child struggle to remain in hiding a the evil warlord is out to get them . In addition , it ha beautiful cinematography , with luscious landscape of the village and countryside-instantly reminds you of the ancient time in Japan . As with most samurai movie like `` The Seven Samuari '' and `` The Last Samuarai , '' this movie is no le than pure , sometimes graphic , action . There are several disturbing scene in the film . Therefore , it is not the casual sci-fi film . Yet , it is strong and powerful , and delivers a message that a good-natured human can overcome any adversary , a depicted in this film , even the young innocent girl can calm the wrath of the demon god . The scene of the demon god , known a Daimajin , trampling on it enemy and anything that stand in his way will instantly remind you of a Godzilla or Gamera film . Overall , a powerful and serious , yet hopeful film . So , be careful with your samurai sword . You would n't want to rattle Daimajin 's cage . Grade A",1
"Fourteen of the funniest minute on celluloid . This short parody is at least a much a part of the Star Wars saga a Phantom Menace , and far more entertaining , if you ask me . Hardware Wars wa the first in a long line of SW spoof which form their own subgenre these day . I hate to describe it too much-it 's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing . Suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspect of Star Wars have fun poked at them . Household appliance such a toaster and vacuum cleaner portray spaceship and robot , the Princess Anne-Droid character wear actual bread roll on her head instead of the famous coil of braided hair , and Fluke Starbucker is even more of a dork than his original , if that 's possible . Ernie Fosselius is one crazy son-of-a-buck-he 's also the source of Porklips Now , the Apocalypse Now spoof .",1
"`` A wrong-doer is often a man that ha left something undone , not always he that ha done something . '' -- Emperor Marcus Aurelius The DVD release of `` Watch on the Rhine '' could not come at a better moment . It restores to u a major Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett ( Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dick 's audio commentary affirms his authorship ) . It present a subtle performance by Bette Davis , who took a subdued secondary role long after she 'd become the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros. lot . Equally significantly , it reminds u that World War II had a purpose . Sure , you say , like we needed that . We 've heard Cary Grant sermonizing in `` Destination Tokyo '' ( 1943 ) about Japanese boy and their Bushido knife . We 've watched jackboot stomp the living hill in `` The Sound of Music '' ( 1965 ) . We 've toured an England callously occupied by Germany in `` It Happened Here '' ( 1966 ) . Yet , truth to tell , we still need the message spread . I have an 81-year-old friend who curse Franklin Roosevelt regularly . He feel that FDR connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we did n't need , and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin . He 's encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leader and the trivializing of War Two by Patrick Buchanan . The political columnist ha freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claim that Adolf Hitler would have posed no further menace to Poland , Europe , or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939 . Buchanan hold that if those selfish Poles had n't confronted the Nazis , drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France , no war would have engulfed the West . He belief that without the rigor of Total War , no one in Germany would have built gas chamber to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem . Some commenters on this site feel that `` Watch '' sag under the weight of stale propaganda . Maybe . However , neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have gotten the film 's point : Some people hurt and kill to grab other people 's land , good , and liberty ; such people dominated the Axis Powers and `` enough '' did n't appear in their vocabulary . Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won . He and Bette Davis put convincing passion into their portrayal of refugee who fight oppressor . They give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sideline , for actively facing down torturer and murderer . Bernard Dick note that Hellman did n't care for Lukas a a person since he stayed apolitical . Of course , a a Hungarian he had seen first-hand Bela Kun 's bloody `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' replace an outmoded empire and then topple to Admiral Horthy 's right-wing tyranny . In a marvelous cameo role added to the play by Hammett , Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer of the class that disdain the brown shirt he serf . His Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot of July 20th against Hitler . In April 1940 , however , he pragmatically abets the Nazi cause , although he insult Herr Blecher `` the Butcher '' and scorn the Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on an Underground leader . Teck , a pauper and possible cuckold , wish cash and a visa to return to Europe where he can resume the shred of a life that had come undone with the empire-shattering Great War and the greater world-wide economic Depression . He ha no political conviction , no scruple about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow . Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends this burnt-out case 's Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace . Lucille Watson give winsome vitality to the grasping man 's hostess , a domineering old gal who know her mind and get her way -- but who doe n't adequately appreciate her child and their achievement outside the home she control . She and her pallid office-bound son belong to the American version of von Ramme 's and de Brancovis ' privileged kind . However , this family ha n't seen ruin and never will . They 're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it . This mother and son might easily make choice which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourish today in my friend and in pundit Buchanan . `` Watch on the Rhine '' ha a manicured period look . Its dialogue reflects it erudite origin on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the street . Yet Hellman and Hammett 's film ha gut-based power . Audiences still need to hear and heed it call to arm against grabber relentlessly on the march .",1
"First off ; I 'm a dedicated fan of Modesty 's , and have been reading the comic since I wa a child , and I have found the earlier movie about our heroine unsatisfying , but where they fail , this one ROCKS ! Well then , here we go : Ms Blaise is working for a casino , a gang of robber come along and she start gambling for her friend life . If the robber win one round , she 'll have to tell him about herself . If she win two time in a row , one of the staff member go free . ( Sounds stupid , yeah , well , I 'm not that good at explaining either .. ) ; ) She tell him about growing up in a war zone , without parent or friend , about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape , living by nature 's own rule . They hunt for food , and he teach her to read and fight . As they approach civilization they get caught up in a war , and a they are taken for rebellion , they are being shot at and the old man dy , which leaf her to meet the city by herself . Then she meet the man who 's casino she 's now working for , and there the story end . What is to follow is that there 's an awesome fight and the line 's are totally cool . Alexandra Staden is a TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise ! Just a modest and strong , graceful and intellectual a the comic-one . Feels awkward though , too hear Modesty speak with a slightly broken accent , but that 's not relevant since the comic book- blaise ca n't speak out loud , but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent . ( Not to mention that it 's weird everybody 's speaking English in the Balkan .. ) The acting is really good , even the child who personifies the young Blaise must have a applaud ! My favorite part must be where she rip up her dress to kick the stupid robber 's as ! Totally awesome ! : D I ca n't wait until the real adventure begin in the next movie/s ! Watch it , you wo n't be disappointed !",1

Lorre 's infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively which make the performance all the better when he ha his face hideously burned in a hotel fire and , when no one will give him a chance to work , turn reluctantly to a life of crime . Lorre 's range a an actor is seldom a apparent a in this movie with his jovial , good-natured immigrant , to his depressing , melancholic , disfigured self searching for the truth behind what he believed America afforded him , to his suave , intelligent , better-than-your-average hood , to his sympathetic dealing with a blind woman with whom he fall in love . The story is well-paced , ha some interesting twist , and give Lorre many opportunity to shine . Director Robert Florey doe a quality job behind the lens , and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with Evelyn Keyes giving a particularly good turn a the blind girl . I loved the ending - and the truth - that wa shone to exist in Lorre 's character despite all the negative thing society had done toward him . For a little B picture , The Man Behind the Mask is good movie-making for it time .",1
"My cable TV ha what 's called the Arts channel , which is a `` catch-as-catch-can '' situation sometimes , sometimes film , sometimes short clip of film or ballet , and I came into this just a the bar scene came on , where they tear up their coupon . Excellent , exquisite , Ealing win again , my wartime-Glasgow-raised mother would love this , should I ever find a copy of it . Some of Britain 's best artist , from Mr Holloway to Wayne and Radford and the delicious Miss Rutherford , having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the Home Office . Loved the last scene , where a soon a they are `` back in England ! '' the temperature plummet and it rain ...",1
"I have copy of this on VHS , I think they ( The television network ) should play this every year for the next twenty year . So that we do n't forget what wa and that we remember not to do the same mistake again . Like putting some people in the director 's chair , where they do n't belong . This movie Rappin ' is like a vaudevillian musical , for those who ca n't sing , or act . This movie is a much fun a trying to teach the 'blind ' to drive a city bus . John Hood , ( Peebles ) ha just got out of prison and he 's headed back to the old neighborhood . In serving time for an all-to-nice crime of necessity , of course . John head back onto the old street and is greeted by kid dog old lady and his peer homeys a they dance and sing all along the way . I would recommend this if I wa sentimental , or if in truth someone wa smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma . Either way this is a poorly directed , scripted , acted and even produced ( I never thought I 'd sat that ) satire of ghetto life with the 'Hood ' . Although , I think the redeeming part of the story , through the wannabe gang fight sequence and the dance number , his friend care about their neighbor and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up . Forget Sonny spoon , Mario could have won an Oscar for that in comparison to this Rap . Oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and three-quarters embarrassed , be sure to drink first . And please , watch responsibly . ( No star , better luck next time ! )",0
I wa actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created . The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe . No worry though a in typical Boll fashion the story in the movie ha very little to do with the game it is based on . Now I understand that certain liberty need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of medium to another but it seems like he really just doe n't even try to make a connection . Not only that but the acting and action sequence are so corny it almost make you feel like the whole project wa one big joke . It ha been said a million time before but why could n't someone more talented pick up the video game right to create a movie ? ? ? ?,0
"I am a fan of bad horror film of the 1950s and 60 -- film so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh . So , because of this it 's natural that I 'd choose this film -- especially because with John Agar in it , it wa practically guaranteed to be bad . Sadly , while it wa a bad film , it wa the worst type of bad film -- dull beyond belief and unfunny . At least with stupid and over-the-top bad film , you can laugh at the atrocious monster and terrible direction and acting . Here , you never really see that much of the monster ( mostly due to the darkness of the print ) and the acting , while bad , is more low energy bad ... listless and dull . The film begin with some young adult going to Satan 's Hollow to neck . Well , considering the name of the place , it 's not surprising when they are later found chewed to piece ! Duh ... do n't go necking at Satan 's Hollow ! ! Well , there are report of some sort of crashing object from the sky , so what do the teen go ? Yep , throw a dance party -- a very , very , very slow dance party where the kid almost dance in slow motion . So it 's up to the Sheriff ( Agar ) and his men to ensure that the teen can dance in peace without fear of mastication . As for the monster , it 's some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask -- a bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER . Not exactly original and not exactly high tech . To make it worse , it make snorting noise and move very , very slowly -- so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it ! How it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me . Overall , too dull to like -- even if you are a fan of lousy cinema .",0
"I absolutely love this movie ! Evil Dead ha NOTHING on this film ! Night of the Demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest , but this one is a classic . It 's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best , but what more could you want from an 80 's horror movie ? Stooge ha some of the best one-liner to ever hit the screen in this one . ( he 's my favorite character ) A lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie , but my personal favorite is the ending , sadly enough ha nothing to do with the main character , when the old man eats his left over Halloween apple in a pie , and his throat is mangled from the inside out . The sound track is awesome . The scene with Angela dancing is totally creepy , especially after the strobe light come on , and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that 's playing . The make-up effect in this movie are pretty sweet ; Angela gave me nightmare a a kid . If you 're the type of person who demand perfection out of your filming experience , you might want to give this one a pas . But , if you 're like me , and you really dig the whole Halloween , haunted house with the demon cliché , than this one is definitely a must own .",1
"Vincent Cassel play the part of Paul , an ex-con assigned to an office job where he meet Carla , a secretary who is quite deaf ' , when she ha her hearing aid in very deaf when not ( played by Emmanuelle Devos ) . Together they help each other to develop a people . What wa particularly interesting about this film wa the complexity of the character  not fitting into obvious stereotype . Paul appears uneasy in the office environment , is it that he 's just not cut out for work ? This belief is dispelled when he get a job in a bar and shine . The film ha a certain amorality which I find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally , even if we think it is harmless or justified . Finally , it is a film full of great moments ' both touching and humorous . One is when Carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby . She continues to cuddle it  but take her hearing aid out for her own comfort .",1
"This film is one of the best short I 've ever seen - and a I make it a point to be at all the major film festival , I 've seen a lot , especially of what the industry considers `` the best . '' I 'm not a fan of Monaghan . His acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me , his only decent performance being in Lost , so I generally try to avoid his film . I did , however , happen to see this at a film festival a few year back and wa completely awed . This director really know what she 's doing . Of course , you are going to get the troll ( or just ignorant people ) who do n't understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it . But luckily , from what I 've seen , they are in the minority when it come to this gem . Let 's not deny that the film wa working on no budget , and that a couple of the supporting actor could still use work , because that 's certainly true . The production value is very low , but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school ? Pretend for a moment that the budget doe n't matter . If you take away a bit of the acting , the sound quality ( which actually wa n't the fault of the filmmaker ; I saw this at a festival and the sound wa fine ... I guarantee whoever made the DVD itself screwed up ) , and the fact it wa shot on mini-DV , then what are you left with ? The story , the visual composition and the soul of the film , which are indisputably flawless . Nanavati can tell a story . That much is clear . She can write substance-heavy , engaging script better than most people in Hollywood , create a shot list that perfectly compliment that story , and bring it to life in a fascinating , creative way that , were this higher budget , might have won award . Give it more experienced actor , better sound post-production , and 35mm instead of mini-DV and even the troll could n't complain . This girl is incredible , and keeping in mind that Insomniac wa made a good few year ago , she 's done some amazing work since . The trailer for Dreams of an Angel show that , and I ca n't wait to see the higher budget stuff she 's done . 9/10 star , this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker .",1
"I watched this movie only because I did n't want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater by themselves . Honestly , I went in expecting to enjoy a good nap -- but found myself entranced by the movie . I 'd recommend it to anyone who asks ! Roy 's mom wa on one of my all-time favorite TV show year ago , playing a mermaid ( Maximum Bob ) . She wa really cute in this movie . The three main character were all excellent young actor . Also enjoyed seeing and hearing Jimmy Buffet . The movie itself wa quite beautiful - showcasing some of what make Florida so great . I 'm glad I ended up going to this movie . And to think , I wa disappointed that I could n't take them to see `` Stick It '' -- I think this wa MUCH better !",1
"I got about halfway through this movie and wa very disappointed . It wa just flat out boring and completely unrealistic . I can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movie , but not when it 's supposed to be a crime drama thing . The evidence collection and interview process were just plain oddball . I started fast forwarding to see how it ended . And then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it . The main character , played by Ellen Barkin , just wa n't believable at all . Peta Wilson acted very well in this film , but her character wa way out there and there wa n't anyone for her acting talent to play off of that made it work .",0
"First of all , let me say the I am LDS or rather , I am a Mormon . So when I watched this film , I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt . I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I watch . And this one wa no exception . It doe have it redeeming moment . But they are few and far between . One of the first thing I noticed that bothered me very greatly wa that it seemed a though Halestorm wa ashamed of our Church ! In the LDS Church , congregation are called `` ward '' and the basketball court is in the `` cultural hall '' . NEVER ONCE are either of these two name mentioned . The Church is never referred to by name and `` the standard '' is a far a it go in mentioning what our Church belief . It make me wonder if the director are really LDS or LDS wannabe ? This film had so much potential ! It could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer , but also what we believe . Instead it wa only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired . If I were not already LDS , I 'd be left thinking Mormons are stupid , idiotic and ashamed of their belief . It is NOT a film I will recommend to my nonLDS friend . Sorry Halestorm . You can do better than this !",0
At least one kind . Very human and moving . Not out to teach a lesson or anything like that . All principal are effective . I saw the movie year ago and still remember it ( but ca n't remember the Morgan Fairchild role ) . And a nice slice of American life .,1
"`` Indian burial ground '' : If those three word appear anywhere in a real-estate listing , look for a different neighborhood . A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery -- and , after a l-o-o-o-ng hike , an ancient Indian burial ground . Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead -- if you do n't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet . It can do the same for dead people -- if you do n't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house . Throw in a busy two-lane blacktop , speeding big rig , a well-meaning ( if somewhat dim ) old neighbor , and one kid who really doe n't get enough supervision , and I think you can figure out what happens from there -- an over-the-top , illogical mess , which , in all fairness , doe offer up a few scare . Well , there are worse Stephen King adaptation ( such a `` Maximum Overdrive , '' which King also directed ) . But there are far better one , too ( such a `` Salem 's Lot , '' `` The Dead Zone , '' and both version of `` The Shining '' ) .",0
"Well , since it 's called Porno Holocaust and directed by Joe D'Amato , I went into this film expecting sleaze ... and while I somewhat got it , Porno Holocaust wa a massive disappointment a it 's just so damned BORING . The title suggests that the film will feature porn , and that 's not wrong - Porno Holocaust is pretty much just porn , and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again , I wa fast forwarding before the end . The first sex scene is between two woman and it got my hope up , but after that it just degenerate into normal porn , and the rest of the film ( for the first hour ! ) is made up of talking , and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through ! The plot focus on a deserted island where , believe it or not , something strange is going on . Naturally , it 's not long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientist , who all happen to be sexy woman , land on the island . They have sex a few time and some strange thing happen , then over an hour later they 're attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the lady ... This must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno - a zombie who like to get it on , but unsurprisingly it doe n't work well at all . The film clock in at just ten minute short of the two hour mark , and that is far too long for a film like this . I have no idea why Porno Holocaust is a long a it is ; if they 'd just snipped one minute out of every sex scene , the film would have been under ninety minute , and that would have made it much more tolerable ! The zombie take what seems like an eternity to appear ( it 's quite a long time before there 's a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place ) , and when it doe finally appear , it 's a huge disappointment ! I realise that this is low budget B-movie trash , but D'Amato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this ! I 'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting , atmosphere etc , there 's no point . Porno Holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror , and I ca n't recommend it !",0
"I 'm sorry but I did n't like this doc very much . I can think of a million way it could have been better . The people who made it obviously do n't have much imagination . The interview are n't very interesting and no real insight is offered . The footage is n't assembled in a very informative way , either . It 's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special feature . One thing I 'll say is that Isabella Rosselini get more beautiful the older she get . All considered , this only get a ' 4 . '",0
"I finally caught up to `` Starlight '' last night on television and all I can say is . . . wow ! It 's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effect ( check out the laser beam shooting out of Willie 's eye ! ) , the atrocious acting , the ponderous dialogue , the mismatched use of stock footage , or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production . This truly is a one-of-a-kind experience , and we should all be thankful for that . I nominate Jonathon Kay a the true heir to Ed Wood !",0
"Movie Title - Tart Date of review - 5/26/02 Year of movie - 2001 Stars - Dominique Swain , Brad Renfro , Bijou Phillips ( barely ) , Melanie Griffith ( barely ) NeCRo 's Rating - 4 skull out of 10 May Contain spoiler Plot An `` outcast '' Dominique Swain want to be with the `` in '' group and so she abandon her real friend and join them ....... much annoying rich people talk occurs . Acting ugh , I guess I got what I wanted in that Dominique wa ok , but man , the rest of the cast besides maybe Brad Renfro were bad or at least not interesting or likable at all . I know some could say that the others were good because they made me hate them .... trust me .... I like unlikable char but this group is unlikable because they ca n't convincingly be bad people . It figure that the only other people I got this for were barely even in it and that is Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips , but the little time they had they were ok. Melanie spoke maybe 2 line , but at least Bijou had a good character although small . Violence and Gore My mind wa constantly under attack from horrid dialogue and very very annoying character , that 's violence enough ! ! ok there wa one bludgeoning with a rock which wa ok. T & A Nudity Factor hahaha , they could n't even add in any nudity to help spice up this movie , probably because no one would want to bear their body for this crap . If they are going to expose themselves they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered a their character and not for `` oh hey I heard she get naked in this one . '' Overall View of the movie ( review ) ok ok I know I pride myself on being the person who can like most if not almost all movie or at least find some good in it . Well this movie is one of the few I really struggled to find anything worth while in . The problem with this movie is that it is so damn annoying . I already have a deep hatred for snobby rich people attitude and that did n't help either . All this movie really is , is just a bunch of rich people sitting around acting depressed and stupid . I ca n't stress the annoyance factor enough . This movie try to rehash the tried and true `` In group '' plotline which can usually be done ok with little difficulty . Why do I not have a pic from the movie or the box cover ? Well I felt this movie did n't deserve that glory so I decided to put a pic of the reason I rented this , and that reason is none other than Dominique Swain . Yes I too wa wooed by her in Lolita and thought she wa so good that I decided from then on to check her out in any movie in which she act . At least I keep my promise and yes I have seen the majority of her movie , minus a few hard to find one . She herself is a great actress and I would defend her actively , but man she chooses some of the crappiest movie to star in . This movie and Smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness , but at least Smokers had a cool idea for a story and even some real good scene . Also the dvd box try to fool you into thinking that this movie ha star a well in it by putting Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips name on the front of the box . If there 's one thing that P * * * * S me off it 's a movie that plaster the name of star on a box to make you think `` wow it ha ____ I wonder how good ___is in this one I saw ___ in that movie and thought she wa great ! '' only to have the big name in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minute between the 2 . Bijou actually had a part that semi-meant something . Melanie on the other hand , only ha 2 line about .... Granted I do n't like Melanie that much , but this is about ethic and not star acting . Out of all this mess though prop must go to Brad Renfro for turning in an ok performance along with Dominique . Brad may be one very messed up kid in real life , but at least he can act . So the only reason this movie get any skull is because I got what I basically wanted which wa Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro . Also I had the added pleasure of seeing underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more . So even though I wa annoyed throughout I still came out with some positive , although this wa pretty hard this time . I recommend you to ONLY see this if you 've seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you are some offbeat fan of Brad or Bijou . Uber Melanie fan will be sorely depressed . Also if you 're a fan of crappy movie like me , please do not assume this be a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty alright , for the money spent on buying or renting . Some movie are `` so bad that they are good '' a the saying go . What they forgot to add wa `` so bad that they are good ( to pas up ) . '' NeCRo",0
"Another Day - this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it . I thoroughly enjoy watching Shannen Doherty and I wa quite interesting in seeing how well Julian McMahon and Shannen appeared together following the role they played in Charmed . I can certainly PRAISE the acting skill throughout the film , even the directing - but the plot ... what happened ? I am at a loss for word because I am still confused . I have to stay loyal to the actor who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot . I also have to recommend you watch it because despite the plot-madness I would still watch it over and over again .",0
This did for crime what `` Not Another Teen Movie '' did for school . I laughed all the way through a 2 inept gang warred with each other and among themselves . An unsubtle comedy using overt joke and gag that kept me rolling all the way . I suppose the biggest gag in the entire film wa that time never seemed to go forward leaving the character trapped in the 30 's .,1
"I loved this movie . It is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum Vietnam , and this movie-sans combat scene and exciting bomb and gunfire- did it . I had no idea I 'd be so affected by it . What an amazing look at how alien Vets feel . It wa tough to watch , quite frankly . We all understand the fighting and the Apocalypse Now type of drama , but this is so so different . What happens when they come back and try to live a life ? They ca n't . It made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in America . Not able to relate , ca n't sleep , ca n't have love affair , ca n't deal with `` normal society '' . They feel totally apart . This is a huge tragedy , and one that is n't addressed enough . Yeah , we 've changed our attitude about Vietnam Vets , we like them now , but so what ? It doe n't seem to have made any difference to them . It 's too late ? So it wa a great film , but I cried a lot . I have no other criticism .",1
"Problems : 1 ) Although billed a `` a loving tribute to Poverty Row , '' a lot of the old footage is not even from Poverty Row film -- much of it is from RKO 's `` The Most Dangerous Game , '' ( 1932 ) , with some from the silent ( ! ? ) version of `` The Lost World '' ( 1926 ) ! 2 ) Much of the old footage is just used a filler ( the old shipboard footage ) or a silent shot ( for example , of Bela walking , looking or staring ) often repeated ; 3 ) Where is the pantheon of Poverty Row Master Thespians ( Bela , Boris , Lon Chaney , Jr. , George Zucco , John Carradine , Buster Crabbe , Tom Neal , etc . ) emoting their line a punch line to the 'new ' character joke ( a in Woody Allen 's `` What 's Up Tiger Lily ?

"This movie start slow , then taper off . After watching for about an hour , and seeing absolutely nothing happen , I walked out . I mean , nothing happened . Zero . Zip . Nada . There is no story .

There is no motion . I could have told the same `` story '' with a couple still picture with caption . The script is a joke . It 's just awful . I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it . My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minute of my life watching `` Love In the Time of Money '' , but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader . I could have been the first to walk out , but I waited a bit too long . Instead , I watched about 20 people walk out before me .",0
"Man , what a scam this turned out to be ! Not because it wa n't any good ( a I wa n't really expecting anything from it ) but because I wa misled by the DVD sleeve which ignorantly paraded it `` star '' a being Stuart Whitman , Stella Stevens and Tony Bill . Sure enough , their name did not appear in the film 's opening credit , much le themselves in the rest of it ! ! As it turned out , the only movie which connects those three actor together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY ( 1975 )  but what that one ha to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anybody 's guess Even so , since I paid $ 1.50 for it rental and I wa in a monster-movie mood anyhow , I elected to watch the movie regardless and , yup , it stunk ! Apart from the fact that it had a no-name cast and an anonymous crew , an unmistakably amateurish air wa visible from mile away and the most I could do with it is laugh at the JAWS-like pretension and , intentionally so , at the resistible antic of two moronic layabouts-cum-boat owner who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on . The creature itself  a plesiosaur i.e . half-dinosaur/half-fish  is imperfectly realized ( naturally ) but , a had been the case with THE GIANT CLAW ( 1957 ) which I 've also just seen , this did n't seem to bother the film-makers none a they flaunt it a much a they can , especially during the movie 's second half !",0
"Cassavetes wa clearly an intelligent , sensitive man with bold new idea about making film . He wanted to be an auteur , to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the American cinema . For that , I applaud him . Unfortunately , a a member of his audience , I can not applaud A Woman Under the Influence . Cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic ( an insane woman ) and somehow managed to craft a dull film , filled with lengthy , ad-libbed ranting and drawn-out scene . He seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moment of a person 's life on film , and it often appears a though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run . This tactic would be acceptable if Cassavetes had captured something devastatingly REAL -- or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in way a conventional film could not . Yet I found the performance , particularly Rowlands ' , to be artificial . I never believed for a moment that she wa really insane . I have met people who are truly mentally disturbed , yet I 've never seen any of them act quite like Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence . She played it like a very obnoxious , uninhibited woman who drink a lot , and even that wa confusing because we only see her drink once ( at the beginning ) , but she act drunk for the remainder of the film . There are some moment in which she tap into something real , but those moment are few and far between ; she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character . Again , I applaud her effort , but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true . Novice audience who happen upon this film and see it high IMDb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly , just to prove that they 'get it . ' But do n't be brainwashed by the hype -- judge for yourself . You do n't have to pretend to like it . Like Woody Allen , John Cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film-making , seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experience so endlessly fascinating that he could n't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self-indulgent . But Woody Allen at least ha demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained -- he know that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie . If Cassavetes had employed some self-discipline ( and a sharp pair of editing shear ! ) , A Woman Under the Influence could have stood a chance . But what 's the point of making a 'realistic ' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art-house devotee and film student who worship Cassavetes a some sort of anti-establishment deity ? Without dumbing anything down , I believe Cassavetes could have made A Woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot , instead of presenting a string of 30 minute-long scene of ad-libbed argument . If you just make film for yourself and a few of your fan , you 're just reaching the already converted . Watch this movie with your own set of eye and make your own decision about it . If you are truly moved and fascinated by it , good for you .",0
"This is a good plot concept , so why-o-why is it such a poor film . The acting is terrible and every shock is signposted so far in advance that it is almost laughable by the time it reach you . Spend your time and money elsewhere , this is not worth watching .",0
"One of the better movie to come out of the 1980 's , this based-on-fact movie tell the story of a disturbed high school student who murder his girlfriend , leaf her naked body on a river bank , and brag about it later to his friend . What is just a bad is their inability to FEEL anything about it . Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kid who have no respect for their parent or any sort of authority , who seem almost doomed to live life of rebellion and recklessness . This drama hit hard and is impossible to forget . The young cast doe a creditable job - even Keanu Reeves , in one of his earliest role , is better than usual . Of course , there 's no reason for the character of Layne ( Crispin Glover ) to be a crazed and off-the-wall a he is , but that 's just Glover being himself . Veteran Dennis Hopper ha an especially good role a a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitude of this group of kid . I would like to point out the chilling performance by Daniel Roebuck a the young murderer ; he 's an under-rated actor and aside from Hopper , his is probably the best performance in the film . I saw `` River 's Edge '' for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable TV movie channel ; however , I did n't catch all of it ; I saw it in it entirety for the first time a number of year later , and now I 've seen it again for what is probably the definitive time . Some potently affecting moment include Madeleine 's ( Constance Forslund ) breakdown where she wail that maybe she should leave her child just like their worthless father did . I also liked the scene where Matt ( Reeves ) face off with his disturbed younger brother ( Joshua Miller ) and when the teacher , Mr. Burkewaite ( Jim Metzler ) deplores the fact that the girl ha died and that none of his student seem to care . I will never forget this film , not a long a I live . It 's too saddening for that . 10/10",1
"If any movie stand out extremely with the actor ' acting skill , this is probably the one . I 've never seen dialogue be spoken in such a rough way , but having a strong feeling . The movie wa disturbing at moment . However , the movie wa terrible at editing . The movie try to go the commercial way by adding comedy and song , yet they feel out of place . Like Karisma is getting beat up , and the same time SRK is fighting ( comically ) with the police officer . The Ishq Kamina song wa very out of place . On top of that , the movie is overly glossy in the beginning . The direction wa not bad , but certainly nothing one can brag about . I have to say that the actor ' were chosen very wisely . Without them , this movie would not have an impact . Karisma Kapoor ha given her best role to date , and this look very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza . She look pretty in the first half , and I 've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger a well a her . What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date . Nana Patekar wa excellent a her father-in-law . Not much to say about him , besides this is a role made for him . Deepti Naval a the mother-in-law wa excellent especially in her final scene . Though she doe n't have much to say , her facial expression and body language wa good . The other good performance wa the little kid . He wa adorable , and is sure to bring tear to the viewer 's eye . The movie wa probably saved desperately by their performance . Sanjay Kapoor wa all right , but he did n't have much to do . Shahrukh Khan wa wasted in his bad boyish type role . One thing that brought the audience to the theater wa Ishq Kamina . The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyric of the song . And boy Aish is mad hot . However , the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever . People may have come to the movie for Aish , but they wo n't brag too much about it after-wards . Hum Tum Miley wa properly paced , but seemed to drag a the suspense mood wa leaving throughout the movie . Damroo Bhaje wa boring and nothing to rave about . Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie . Despite the poor editing , the performance alone make it a must see .",1
"Four great story from master Robert Bloch , adapted to the screen by the best actor in the field in the early Seventies , are the base of this excellent Amicus ' production . This wa a kind of movie very popular in the Sixties till the mid-Seventies and it 's one of my favorite type of horror movie . This one in particular shine for the episode Sweets to the Sweet , where Christopher Lee is stalked by his evil little girl child , heiress to her mother tradition . Great fun from start to finish , and good to very good are also the other three episode ( with the last one a bit on the comic side , but with the great addition of Ingrid Pitt , the most famous vampress of the English cinema .",1
"I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I have been able to see in quite some time . The animation is stunning . The artwork behind each and every landscape wa beautiful . From the color to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry . I wa amazed . Moving beyond the beauty on the screen , you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh . Character development is brief yet these touchstone moment are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character ha come to where they stand . I 'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family .",1
"I am the guy who usually keep opinion to himself , but I just got back from this movie , and felt I had to express my opinion . Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan . But what make a horror movie ? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development . I know they often lack in horror movie , but Prom Night looked like it did n't even put forth ANY effort in that department . Next , we all love suspense . That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprise . Yeah , Prom Night had none of that ! Of course , we like a terrifying killer . Prom Night have that ? Nope , it ha a pretty boy with a cute lil ' knife . And when all else fails ... at least horror ha it guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore , and the occasional nude scene ! Yeah , well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night , they leave that stuff out too . So with all of these element missing , I ask .... doe this still count a a horror movie ? Nope . I 'd call it more of a comedy . People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw `` Semi-Pro '' that wa supposed to actually be a comedy ( which also sucked , but thats another story ! ) . I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror . All the good horror movie of the good ol ' day have been remade into garbage so movie studio can make money . The people I went to see it with did n't even know this wa a remake ! Which made me mad ! I wonder what will happen when there 's no more movie to remake ? ? ? Where will horror go next ? ? ?",0
"This movie ha it all : it is a thriller , a chase movie , a romance story , a mob tale , a comedy , a road movie ... well , in fact it 's none of this at all . All the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen , but no , you are still watching the same dull , uninspiring and superficial cliché of a movie with a very bad soundtrack . Even the star cast acting is lacking in credibility . A hit man with his quirk , a girl who 's playing hard to get , mob guy acting tough and incapable cop , yawn ... I 'd recommend not to watch Backtrack . If you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor , go and see 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada ' by Tommy Lee Jones . Now , that 's what I call worth watching .",0
Surprisingly good `` Mean Streets '' -type crime drama . Foreshadows element of `` Goodfellas '' and `` Casino '' . Joe Pesci 's first big role . Clever dialog . I think the Maltin guide give this a bomb rating . I can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it . Saw this at Tarantino 's film fest and he said Scorsese used a number of these actor in Raging Bull .,1
"I saw this film at SXSW with the director in attendance . Quite a few people walked out , and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end . Of the 60 or 70 film I 've seen at this festival , Frownland is among the worst . At 106 minute , it is at least 95 minute too long . You get to watch the main character 's failed and drawn out attempt to communicate , in extended real time . The same grimace , hand over mouth motion , kinetic and frantically repeated word and syllable over and over and over again - WE GET THE POINT . One site actually compare this work to early Mike Leigh . What drug would you have to be on to make that statement ? Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song , maybe you 'd have to be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film . Unbelievably , this won a jury award at the festival . You can bet it did not win an audience award .",0
"First , let me mention the fact that , in spite of it title ( « Stories » , in plural ) , there is only ONE Kitchen Story . As to whether Isak died or not at the end , I 'm not so sure since , in one of the very last scene , HIS PIPE is seen lying on the table next to the two cup . On the DVD cover , there is a reference to Tati . It claim that the film is « très drôle : rappelle Tati ! » ( « Very funny : reminiscent of Tati ! » . The great Jacques Tati relied mainly on mime and silent deadpan attitude to achieve his comical effect and to offer his critically satiric view of his 1950 ’ s French « modern » society . Of course « Kitchen » doe take place during the 1950 ’ s and it doe offer some ( rather faint ) satirical reference to the absurdity of bureaucracy and there are some long moment were no word are uttered -– but they are not really funny . Are all these small detail enough to make « Kitchen » a « Tatiesque » movie ? This being said , I have to admit that « Kitchen » doe deal with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research versus the « truth » of human subjective emotion . Generally speaking , the movie wa agonizingly slow , with nothing much happening -- with barely any « dramatic impulse » : the involving part were the set up during the first 15 minute or so , and during the last half hour or so . Indeed , the last segment wa -- FINALLY ! ! ! -- interesting and moving . It might seem that it wa a short subject , of le than an hour , unduly stretched to some 90 minute . Now , about the set-up ( a « scientific » observation on the behavior of single male in their kitchen ) : at first it seemed very promising –- with the charting out of the coming and going of bachelor in their kitchen a a mean to determine what new invention would be most useful to come up with . But very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue , an « excuse » to introduce the real subject which wa only fully developed towards the end and which wa about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship . Pity ! I honestly wanted to like that movie . Yes , it seemed so promising when I heard about some of it unusual little « anecdote » -- which were indeed there and which I enjoyed -– such a the burning of a man ’ s nose hair ( instead of using scissors to cut it off ) , the « investment » of having a huge quantity of « valuable » black pepper stacked away in a barn , the role reversal ( the observant becoming the observed ) , a man ’ s mouth emitting sound from a radio program . And there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst of half-hidden human despair , the relative importance of right or left side car driving in Sweden and Norway ( a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighboring country to affirm it individuality ? ) . Am I the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film ? Does this necessarily mean that I 'm wrong ? Perhaps it ’ s almost generally praised « fine point » were , in fact , « too subtle » for me ? Perhaps ... Could my individual view on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself -- which would be the vital necessity to have the right to differ , to affirm one ’ s individuality and not to follow blindly society ’ s trend and opinion ? Each one of u ha the right to have different personal view and not to be a slave of the demand of one ’ s bread-winning « dictatorial » demand : often , we do have other alternative that would allow each one of u to be useful to our society while respecting one ’ s inner principle . In short , being true to oneself -– the way that in that film Folke ( Isak ’ s « scientific observer » ) end up by giving up his job while preferring to stay in his new friend Isak ’ s house and help his out with the task of his farm ... And so , « Vive la différence » , a the French say !",0
"With the mixed review this got I wa n't expecting too much , and wa pleasantly surprised . It 's a very entertaining small crime film with interesting character , excellent portrayal , writing that 's breezy without being glib , and a good pace . It look good too , in a funky way . Apparently people either like this movie or just hate it , and I 'm one who liked it .",1
"The only reason I rented this movie wa that Val Kilmer rarely star in a bad movie . There is of course a first time for everything . In many way , this movie prof that oaters are n't a easy to make a we think , especially by foreign director . The only one who got by with it wa probably Sergio Leone , but even his movie lacked that something indefinably innate to our American psyche and panache . American actor in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda did help . I can see now why they changed the original title from `` Summer Love '' to `` Dead Man 's Bounty '' . That itself tell me the producer and director did n't have any core understanding about a western other than those standard shoot'em up scene and violent theme . I suppose we can say the same about American director attempting to make a Polish movie while failing miserably in the process .",0
"It 's hard to put your finger on this one . Basically I suppose it 's a comedy about an idle rich drunk who fall in love with a ( comparatively ) poor girl , whom he want to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family . It ha funny moment , romantic moment , and touching moment . Dudley Moore is funny and somehow make his self-centred character endearing , Liza Minelli is a convincing foil a the the feisty opposite he attracts , but John Gielgud steal the show a Arthur 's wonderfully sarcastic butler . It 's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack , and ran for nearly 3 month at our local fleapit .",1
"Fabulous film ! Rented the DVD recently and wa floored by this stunning piece of work . Douglas Sirk wa a filmmaking genius and he get performance out of Rock Hudson , Dorothy Malone ( Oscar winner ) , Robert Stack ( Oscar nominated ) , and Lauren Bacall that word can not describe . Paul Verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having Dorothy Malone play Sharon Stone 's murdering inspirational guru in his Basic Instinct . What a great joke ! By turn the film is hilarious , riveting , campy , biting , trashy , compelling , and eye rolling ! It 's definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big-and-little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you 'll see here : the camera work is smooth and polished , the use of color is breathtaking , the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable , the one dimensional character are unforgettable , and the final image will have you scratching your head a to how the censor back then let it make the final cut ! While most older , highly regarded film can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through , Written on the Wind contains so much and go by so fast that it 's actually a shame when it end . Thank you to Mr. Sirk for crafting -and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to- what ha now become one of my favorite film of all time ! SEE THIS MOVIE ! ! !",1
"I had just watched one episode of this program and I could n't even get to the end of the program . Every minute I had watched this program my I.Q must of dropped about 10 point . This is basically like a child 's program but with swearing . Not even the swearing and the insult she tell other people made me laugh . Anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded , disappointing , horribly acted program . Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lesson .",0
"This movie ha some good line , but watching Dillon 's less-than-masterful Rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original . I like Marisa Tomei but she 's no Faye Dunaway . Also , in my opinion , the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about . You might not LOVE the character , but you should care what happens to him . This is achieved in Barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fight with Eddie the bartender . The main fight in Factotum is when , completely unprovoked , he stalk up to the Lily Taylor character in a bar , punch her to the floor and call her a whore . The whole thing just did n't work . Again , some great line -- some laugh-out-loud funny -- but a a movie overall it 's a fail . Mediocre attempt at reinventing something that wa brilliant , and you ca n't get past that . Next ? Let 's remake Breakfast at Tiffany 's with Kate Hudson .",0
"My kid make better video than this ! I feel ripped off of the $ 4.00 spent renting this thing ! There is no date on the video case , apparently designed by Wellspring ; and , what 's even worse , there 's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie ! The only date given is 2002 , leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he 's getting a recent film . This movie wa so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it wa made , that I 'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it a a video . It might be of interest to student studying the counter-culture of the 1960 's , the anti-war , anti-establishment , tune-in , turn-on and drop out culture ; but when you read the back of the video case , there 's no hint that that is what you 're getting . If you do make the mistake of renting it though , it is probably best viewed while on drug , so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the mind of the director , Fassbinder and Fengler . Regardless of your state of mind while watching it , I can tell you that it doe n't get any better after the first scene ; so , knowing that , I 'm sure you 'll be fast asleep long before the end .",0
"This very peculiar setting of Wagner 's last opera definitely grew on me . When I first saw it , I wa somewhat annoyed by many of the film surrealistic image , and felt that far too much wa superimposed upon the story . However , if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherché `` gimmick , '' I think you will find that the film DOES manage to capture the very strange , other-worldly atmosphere of the opera , and that there are moment which are particularly fine . Personally , I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever portrayed her . Her performance ( a lip-synchronized mime of the singing voice of Yvonne Minton ) is nothing short of dazzling , from end to end , and alone justifies the hour it take to absorb the film . Another reason to delight in this film is that it capture the spectacular interpretation of Robert Lloyd of the crucial role of Gurnemanz , one which Lloyd ha performed to a crisp at opera house throughout the world . I have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera several time , and the lusciousness of his voice , and the warm , fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved , a did his performance in the character 's two major monologue , the Karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in Act 1 . The version I have seen wa a videotape made for America , and so there were subtitle which , ala , could not be done away with . This is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and force an extremely Christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layer of interpretation on the opera . This seemed to me to be quite contrary both to Wagner 's clear AVOIDANCE of Christianity , and his very deliberate attempt to `` generalize '' the Christian element of the story . ( See footnote with spoiler at the end of this review . ) I find it nearly impossible , when viewing a film with subtitle , to keep from absorbing them , and strongly recommend that , if in the DVD version you have the ability to turn the subtitle off , you do so , and instead , if the opera is unfamiliar to you , that you read the libretto carefully beforehand . The bottom line is that there is much in the film which I dislike , and would just a soon have seen done differently ... but it ha risen steadily in my estimation over the year since I first saw it , and I find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again . __________________________________________________________________ FOOTNOTE CONTAINING A SPOILER : A good example would be Kundry 's famous line , `` I saw him ... him ... and laughed . '' This get translated , in the subtitle , for reason which escape me , a `` I saw the Savior 's face . '' It is especially irritating to me , because throughout the libretto , Wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character WHO NEED NOT BE THE BIBLICAL Jesus a `` der Heiland , '' i.e. , the German for `` The Healer '' -- a reference to the wound of Amfortas , and to all wound and malady and the need for healing .",1
"Well how wa I suppose to know this wa `` the '' dumb as promotional `` Lordi Motion Picture '' ? I mean , I realized this when that `` dinosaur '' costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I wa humming `` Hard Rock Hallelujah '' to myself ... even though I hate that song . `` Dark Floors '' is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they , and the rest of the people in that particular elevator , become momentarily trapped ... When they arrive at their floor it come a quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around . The hospital is empty ... Except for a variety of monster that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason ... They run through the hallway and stairwell , encountering all of the band member of the heavy metal band in their outlandish , shock-rock costume ... Nothing really memorable here , except the lousy acting , lack of gore/nudity , and the utterly shameless promotional edge , reminding me very much of `` KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park '' . Yeah , remember that dud ? Wish I did n't ... I would just recommend avoiding all of these Ghost House film like a fungus and not listen to Lordi since they are a Gwar ripoff band !",0
"Discovering something , the journey is so much more fun , so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination . Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feeling in the world . You feel energized , invigorated and alive . You simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice get you excited and sometimes aroused . Love , and all the physical and emotional side effect that come with it , is pure bliss . Where it go from here is anyone 's guess , but when you first begin your journey together , nothing can compare to it . Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner , two emotionally scarred middle aged individual . In this film , they are about to embark on that mystical journey together , where love , and the discovery of the emotion along the way , will help save them . Lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still love her , but in her eye , only because the woman he cheated with no longer want him . As hurt a she wa by him , a much a she really dislike him , there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back . Why you might ask ? Because in life , and love , sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence . Yes , this man cheated on her but she ha kid with him , she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him . Richard Gere play a recently divorced husband and estranged father . He also just lost a patient a she reacted negatively to the anesthetic . He is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue . This is what brings him to Rodanthe in the first place . Although his lawyer told him not to , he felt compelled to visit the woman 's husband in Rodanthe . He stay at the Inn that Adrienne is taking care of . Soon , they find comfort in each other 's arm and discover that they too can have a second chance in life . By now this sound like a simple idea for a film , and although it might be something you 've seen or read about before , Gere and Lane simply own the film . Diane Lane light the screen up with her smile . Her eye twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching . Gere 's character is a little different . He is more hardened and bitter . It take Adrienne 's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell . He blame quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blame himself for the death of the patient . On the outside he tell anyone who will listen that it is not his fault , and that she wa a 1 in 50,000 casualty . But deep down , it eats away at him . They find each other at a time when both need someone to listen . Gere and Lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lover . They were married in Unfaithful but here they play lover finding each other when the people in their life have abandoned them . They have a spark and a real chemistry . I would love to see more film with them together . In fact , I 'd love to see more film with Diane Lane but that 's a story for another time . Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost soul who save each other . They both become better people , they both become stronger people . I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone , not just couple . This is a film about redemption , absolution , and second chance . It will also ask you to bring some hanky . 8/10",1
"The first question is : how many talentless idiot it take to screw a movie up ? Answer : one is more than enough , if he writes the screenplay and directs it . The second question is : did anyone teach the actor to handle gun properly ? Answer : hell no . I wonder if Kristy Swanson got hit across the face with hot brass - because it damn seemed so ! The third question is : how many time we did the `` super secret government agency conspiracy get uncovered from inside '' plot ? Answer : a good couple too many ! The fourth question is : are Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overrated ? Answer : in this movie , sadly , yes . The fifth question is : can a pair of boob save this movie ? Answer : even three ( Kristy Swanson 's pair and the director/writer ) did n't . God ... If I see the ( most probably ) assassin getting her gun ready for a hit , and then the moron from prop department give her a completely different set the first bloody thing in the goddamn movie , the `` suck '' meter hit the peak . Time from beginning of the movie to me switching the TV off : fifteen minute . Just a little bit more than it took me in case of `` Alone in the Dark '' .",0
"When thinking of the revelation that the main character in `` Bubble '' come to at film end , I am reminded of last year `` Machinist '' with Christian Bale . The only difference between the two film is the literal physical weight of the character . An understated , yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life . The title is cause for contemplation . Perhaps , we , the audience are the one in the `` Bubble '' a we are given no payoff in the film slim 90 minute running time . Audience reaction were often smug and judgmental , clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in character so foreign to themselves . These character are the one people refer to a those that put George W. back in office for a second term . It 's sobering to consider how reality television ha spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their foot for the exit a soon a the credit role . This film ha it 's merit , and is deserving of consideration for the thing it doe n't say outright .",0
"Although it is n't mentioned very often , `` Do n't Look in the Basement '' is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch . The story follows a young nurse , Charlotte Beale , who is hired at Stephen 's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens , after he is murdered by a patient . Many patient begin to torment Miss Beale , and her bos , Dr. Geraldine Masters , act a if she 's hiding something ... This movie ha many appealing character that you actually end up caring about , and have sympathy for during the climax , which doe n't happen very often in horror film . The musical score is great and is reminiscent of `` Dark Shadows , '' the performance from Rosie Holotik , Rhea McAdams , and Bill McGhee are all great , the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending . This movie ha a campy atmosphere around it that no other film I have ever seen ha been able to capture . Many horror fan have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic . `` Do n't Look in the Basement '' is definitely worth watching for all fan of 1970s drive-in film .",1
"This film doe n't have a very clear picture of what it is or want to be . There are some good bit when Stewart is on screen and they give him some line to work with . It work best early on a romantic comedy , but the story keep heading for more dramatic territory and get itself lost in the process . By the last fifteen minute or so , the plot twist are just a series dramatic clichés . The part with the airplane feel like some leftover footage from another film spliced in . The main reason I can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you 've seen all of Jimmy Stewart 's film .",0
"I only came here to check Terror Hospital for an alternate title so I 'd know what not to pick up . Not only do I get the original title , but I come to find Terror Hospital is one of seven more aliases.This one is a real clunker . Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reason , mostly unintended consequence of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment , mostly amusement . This ha none of that . Instead , the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way-too-convenient-for-the-situation exposition and drawn out scene of character warily moving from room to room , and all this is half of the film . Forget trying to figure out where anybody is ( or who they are ) during darkened or nighttime scene , too ; you probably wo n't care , anyway . There is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old driver 's ed movie I slep ... er , I mean sat through and watched way back in high school . Really , we 're talking about mysticism , possession , and a killer on the loose here - not a bad recipe for trash cinema . Unfortunately , there 's nothing here to make it even `` good '' trash ; when joined to the aforementioned , the bad acting and not-so-special effect are just that - bad acting and not-so-special effect . This one 's just trash , pure and simple . Leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale . There 's a reason it there ...",0
"Raising victor Vargas is just a bad film . No amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact . Maybe Peter Sollett saw he did n't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically ape the tenet of current `` edgy film-making '' . Maybe he just doe n't know any better . It 's hard to tell . What 's not hard to tell is the result . Except for a few viewer who will intellectualize the bad film-making into an attempt at pseudo-realism , few will enjoy it . I know I did n't . Do yourselves a favor and pas on this film .",0
"This wa one of my favorite series when I wa a kid . The Swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summer ago when I had just finished my first semester of medical school . I wa surprised to see the depth in which the organ wa explained . Sure , some thing are simplified but most of it wa correct ( even though it wa made 22 year ago ! ) and quite understandable . I would suggest that all soon-to-be medical student should watch it . It is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical word for example . Now I 'm in my 7th semester and I think I 'll watch the series once again a soon a I 've bought the DVD-box : - )",1
"* * Warning ! Mild Spoilers Ahead ! * * ( Yes , I realize it 's tough to spoil an historical documentary , but I do reveal some of the backstory and method . ) This is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage , but also due to the story behind it . Because the Naudets did not set out to tell the story of 9/11 , but rather that of a rookie firefighter , the men 's emotion and the viewer 's connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective . In a filmmaking sense , `` 9/11 '' is textbook . If the event were an actual script , they would be superb , a the character are established , then thrown a curve to which they must react . This is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the director had to wade through to piece this story together . The first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station ; specifically , how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veteran . That part alone is quite good , and had the documentary been allowed to run it intended course , it probably would have been solid . The brother appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter . Then of course , all hell break loose . The chaos following the WTC attack is vividly seen , a various character that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situation . Seeing not only the attack , but also the first-hand reaction is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion . The aftermath , in which firefighter are discovered to be lost and found , is human drama at it peak . Life and death hang in the balance . Unlike many movie , the viewer not only doe n't know who will live and die , but genuinely care about them . The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the Robert DeNiro ( whom I like ) blurb were uninformative , unnecessary , and did n't advance the story at all . They were probably added just to attract more television viewer . Bottom Line : The best documentary I 've ever seen . Nonpareil portrayal of raw human emotion and drama . 9.5 out of 10 .",1
"Currently , this film is listed on IMDb a the 42nd worst film ever made -- which is exactly why I rented it from NetFlix . However , I am saddened to report that the film , while bad , is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 film ever made list . I have personally seen at least 100 film worse than this one . Hardly a glowing endorsement , but it just did n't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list . The film begin with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their belated honeymoon ( by the way , they are married in real life a well ) . He 's a doctor who is obsessed with bat and insists they go to a nearby cave . Once there , they behave very , very , very stupidly ( hallmark of a bad film ) and are soon bitten by a bat . According to this film , bat love to attack people and there are vampire bat in the US -- both of which are not true at all . Oddly , after being bitten , the man doe n't even bother going to the hospital ! ! The first thing on anyone 's mind ( especially a doctor ) is to get medical help immediately , but not this boob . Soon , he 's having seizure -- yet he STILL is n't interested in seeking help ! Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history ! ! After a while , he eventually go to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital . But , by then it 's too late and his attack become more violent and he begin killing people to suck their blood . When it 's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine , the wife ( who , like her husband , ha a grapefruit for a brain ) refuse to believe he 's dangerous -- even after he attack people , steal an ambulance and run a police car off the road ! ! Now most of the time Moss is going through these episode , his eye roll back and he look like a normal person . Oddly , however , a couple time he develops bat-like hand and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat-like . Had this been really cheesy , the film would have merited a 1 . In the very end , in a twist that hardly made any sense at all , the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bat kill the evil sheriff . How all this wa arranged wa a mystery a wa Moss ' and McAndrew 's belief that this film would somehow help their career -- though they both have had reasonably long career on TV playing bit role since 1974 . Overall , very dumb . The plot is silly and make no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real . Not a good film at all , but not among the worst film of all time either . NOTE : For some reason , IMDb show the graphic for the three DVD set for IT 'S ALIVE and it 's two sequel of the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE . While THE BAT PEOPLE ha been seen with the title `` It 's Alive '' , the two movie are not at all related . It 's easy to understand the mistake -- especially since they both came out in 1974 , but the movie I just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell .",0
"Sydney Lumet , although one of the oldest active director , still got game ! A few year ago he shot `` Find me guilty '' , a proof to everyone that Vin Diesel can actually act , if he get the opportunity and the right director . If he had retired after this movie ( a true masterpiece in my eye ) , no one could have blamed him . But he 's still going strong , his next movie already announced for 2009 . But let 's stay with this movie right here . The cast list is incredible , their performance top notch . The little nuance in their performance , the `` real '' dialogue and/or situation that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing . The ( time ) structure of the movie , that keep your toe the whole time , blending time-lines so seamlessly , that the editing seems natural/flawless . The story is heightened by that , although even in a `` normal '' time structure , it would 've been at least a good movie ( Drama/Thriller ) . I can only highly recommend it , the rest is up to you ! : o )",1
"In all honesty , this series is a much a classic ( a television go ) a the original poem is to the world 's literature . Far from being crassly exploitative , it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture 's defining text . I wa moved by the plight of Odysseus and his follower ; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy ( which wa felt but not seen ) ; intrigued by the way the god played with the fate of mortal . ( It should be mentioned that the god appearing here are not ridiculous CGI creature flitting around on their ankle wing , or poorly-cast fashion model in bikini . As in Homer 's work , they act through mortal agent or , rarely , are represented by classical statuary ) . It 's a pity it 's not available in DVD , especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptation of the Odyssey that one can find in video store .",1
"My choice for greatest movie ever used to be Laughton 's `` Night of the Hunter '' which remains superb in my canon . But , it may have been supplanted by `` Shower '' which is the most artistically Daoist movie I have seen . The way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water , and the way that water can be made inspiration , and comfort , and cleansing , and etc . is the essence of the Dao . It is possible to argue that the the NOFTH and Shower theme are similar , and that Lillian Gish in the former represents the purest form of Christianity a the operator of the bathhouse represent the purest form of Daoism . I would not in any way argue against such an interpretation . Both movie are visual joy in their integration of idea and image . Yet , Shower present such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that I give it the nod . I revere both .",1
"At the time that this movie wa made most housewife knew exactly who Barbara Stanwick wa parodying.Today only some woman over 50 probably remember Gladys Taber , whose column `` Butternut Wisdom '' ran in Family Circle Magazine from before World War II until the 1970's.She lived on Stillmeadow Farm in Conecticut , and her column were collected into a number of book , Stillmeadow Seasons , Stillmeadow Daybook , etc . The line that Barbara Stanwick recites a she type them for her column are quite typical of the one that began a typical Gladys Taber column.Besides cooking and country living , she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times.She talked a lot about her favorite dog , mostly cocker spaniels.You might say that Martha Stewart is the Gladys Tabor of today . Christmas is Connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece , but it is pleasant , lighthearted entertainment , soothing to the stressed out mind , and that is good enough",1
"When viewing a movie a silly a 'Hot Rod , ' one must sit back , relax , and alter one 's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is , in this case , a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that ha somehow been mistaken for comedy . With a brief runtime of 88 minute , this film wa long past drawn-out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive joke  joke that came at a minority and were n't even funny in the first place . 'Hot Rod '' s base material is a superficial and irrelevant a 2004 's cult hit 'Napoleon Dynamite , ' though it 's much more contrived and come without ANY of the laughter . In fact , the movie 's blatant desperation to be compared to 'Napoleon Dynamite ' is scornful and offensive , and left me ticked off , instead of just being annoyed . The movie , if one were compelled enough to call it such , pose a paltry story that put self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before u , with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen bus ( one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped , so we 're told by Rod ) and raising $ 50,000 dollar for his stepfather 's impending life-saving heart operation ; all so that he can fight his stepfather , once recovered , and gain his respect because in order to gain one 's respect , one must first fight them . Huh ? Whatever . Each character is no more interesting than Rod 's stick-on mustache , and from the film 's opening joke to it ridiculous conclusion , each scene played like a nonsensical , and terribly unfunny , SNL skit  which , with the addition of an extra 85 minute , is , essentially , what 'Hot Rod ' strives to be . The film 's star , Andy Samberg , contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip-drop of his comedic capability . Unfortunately  rather , realistically  his humorous talent are no more admirable than a five-year-old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee-pee gag . And if that 's disappointing , pull a chair , hide your face in your hand , and brace yourself for the real blow : he IS the film 's humor ! To rescue them of their mortification , I 'll willingly omit the ghastliness of Samberg 's co-star ' role and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team , director Akiva Schaffer , to his non-existent talent a a director or a comedian . Basically , every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash-course comedy is perfectly portrayed here ; and done so arrogantly , a though the film would be funnier that way . Trick yourself into believing that there 's even a single laugh in this heap , or treat yourself to another movie  ANY other movie .",0
"I do n't know what the maker of this film were trying to either accomplish or say , but they badly failed at whatever it wa . Unless of course the object wa to totally confuse the viewer . I watched this movie simply because Drew Barrymore wa in it , and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it . The whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sort of wacko is utterly ridiculous .",0
"If my memory is correct , when this movie wa released it came across a something of a comedy - a funny look at the adult entertainment industry . If that 's what it 's supposed to be , it doe n't really work . It just is n't that funny . Setting that rather significant ( since this is called a comedy ! ) failure aside , since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter , I 'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deal with the going on behind the scene in a Toronto massage parlour , except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull . For over an hour , this movie really doe n't give u much of anything except some background knowledge of the main character . Conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girl are n't giving `` full service '' - a euphemism for actual sex . As for the girl themselves , Betty 's goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business , Cindy is an illegal immigrant to Canada working to support her family back home and Leah is - well , Leah is a somewhat strange , undefined character with a nipple fetish - true - who seems to be in the business because - well , because she 's in it ! I have no idea what her character wa about . Those three may well fairly reasonable composite character who accurately represent the motivation of the woman who get involved in this business . The movie meander about and doe n't offer much until the `` twist '' reveals Conrad to be the bad guy . We should have gotten to that point sooner . The only thing truly interesting here wa that part of the story - Conrad 's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girl . That plan for revenge wa pretty good , and you 're grateful when it come out because basically up to that point you 're wondering why you wasted your time with this . Had the story been more focused on the revenge , this might have actually been a fairly funny movie . The performance from the 4 lead were all OK , although I did n't think anyone came across a outstanding . All four character were a bit shallow . Cindy wa a sympathetic character , and so wa Conrad for a while , although he turn out to be the bad guy of the movie . Given the subject matter , there 's surprisingly little nudity ( and what there is is restricted to one scene . ) In fact , there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this . As for the overall quality of the movie , it 's a low-budget effort , which show , although you expect a certain griminess , I suppose , of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour , so that 's forgivable . It certainly say something , though , that this wa released 8 year ago now and is still the only credit on writer-director Soo Lyu 's resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry - that it wa n't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards - the Canadian version of the Oscars . 4/10 - and I 'm being a bit generous with that .",0
"The idea of making a film about the Beatles sound doomed idea , a no production can catch the idea of the actual historic Beatles . Then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past , but to produce an illustration that work best with the other available Beatles material . This is exactly what 'Birth of the Beatles ' offer to u , the simple story known to u without any extravaganza . * * * SPOILERS here on * * * Be warned that not everything is that accurate a some Beatles-graduates might expect . The Beatles are seen performing song that hardly were even composed by that time . The Beatles perform `` Ask Me Why '' , `` P.S . I Love You '' and even `` Do n't Bother Me '' . The Beatles-graduates should see that if the Beatles on the film only performed song that they actually did at Hamburg , the younger viewer might not anymore recognize the Beatles they have learned to know them . Of that original Hamburg repertoire only `` Johnny B. Goode '' and Stu Sutcliffe 's `` Love Me Tender '' are retained . The guy who play the Beatles in this production scarcely look like the original , but the rest of the film still make good viewing a the film is for the rest fairly accurate . The guy who play Lennon doe it good and the rest of the band are not bad either . Brian Epstein is great and the moment when he sack Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film . Also a a bonus you get to see the original Cavern club in the film .",1
"I first viewed this film shortly after it wa put out on video in 1995 , I dismissed it offhand , saying that Julie wa no Daniel , never really giving it a chance and saying it wa horrid . But here it is , 5 year later , it on Disney and im watching it again . And I 'm finding that it isnt a bad a I made it out to be . Miyagi is still Miyagi , just a kool a ever , the musical score is still there pleasant a ever . And Swank 's character isnt that bad , her acting is pretty good considering the script . It beat the third installment by a wide margin . So , my original rating of 4 ha been raised to 7 .",1
"That is the answer . The question is : What is the single reason to watch this movie ? I loved her in `` My Name Is Julia Ross . '' That is one of the best film noir of all time . Noir or whatever one may call it , it 's a very unsettling movie . She is fun in one of the worst major studio release of all time , too . That would be `` The Guilt Of Janet Ames . '' This one ha a spooky , promising title . It ha a good cast . It ha a fine director . I wa expecting something dark . Maybe something a little tawdry . Instead , it 's an uninspired , routine espionage movie . It 's pretty much is a total bore . At least it wa to me . Ms. Foch is captivating . And that is about it .",0
"It should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with Eddie Murphy . I have never seen anything like it . Murphy go on for almost 70 minute about dick , pussy , tit and insaults so many famous people including his own `` family '' . Among the people who get it by murphy are : Elvis , Mr.T , Michael Jackson , Stevie Wonder , Mick Jagger , Luther Vandross and James Brown . I have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life . I mean , when a person doe n't know who Mr. T is , but still laugh so hard of Murphy a Mr. T , there 's something about it . At the time I saw the show I could n't remember who Mr T. wa but still laughed . Now I know who he is and that just make it so much more funny . Because that 's what Eddie do - he can make those impression so good that it do n't matter who the hell he 's trying to do , it 's still hilarious . And on top of that , we learn that Murphy actually is a very good singer . Please watch it ..",1
"I am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film . Look at it a month later and you might see it differently , or dig it up after 50 year in a different continent and some cult follower find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first . After sitting through The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael at it UK premiere , it came a no surprise to me that I found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself . Shane Danielsen ( Artistic Director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival ) , aided by the film 's director and producer , gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience . Edinburgh Festival audience are not easily shocked . Only one person walked out in disgust . The criticism of the film included very articulate and constructive one from the lay public a well a an actor and a woman who teach M.A . film director . This wa not an overly 'shocking ' film . There wa a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence , but far le extreme than many movie ( most actual weapon contact wa obscured , a were aroused genitals ) . The audience disliked it because they had sat through two hour that were quite boring , where the acting standard were not high , where the plot wa poor , predictable and drawn out , and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie . Metaphors to the war in Iraq are contrived , over-emphasised and sloppy ( apart from a general allusion to violence , any deeper meaning is unclear ) ; and the 'fig-leaf ' reference Marquis de Sade , a one audience member put it , seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale . We have the story of an adolescent who ha a certain amount going for him ( he stand out at school for his musical ability ) but take drug and hang out with youth who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activity extend to rape and violence . When pushed , Robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him . The film is not entirely without merit . The audience is left to decide how Robert got that way : wa it the influence of his peer ? Why did all the good influence and concern from parent and teacher not manage to include him in a better approach to life ? Cinematically , there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hang back ( whether through too much drug , shyness , a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn ? ) . Several of his friend are raping a woman in a back room , partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen . In the foreground of the bare bone flat , a DJ is more concerned that the girl 's scream interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman . Ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activity attract police attention . The stark juxtaposition of serious headphone enjoyment of his music even when he know a rape is going on point up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way . Robert slump with his back to u in the foreground . But the rest of the film , including it supposedly controversial climax involving considerable ( if not overly realistic ) sexual violence , is not up to this standard . Some people have had a strong reaction to it ( the filmmaker ' stated intention : `` If they vomit , we have succeeded in producing a reaction '' ) but mostly - and a far a I can tell the Edinburgh reaction seems to mirror report from Cannes - they feel , `` Why have programmer subjected u to such inferior quality film-making ? '' Director Clay Hugh can talk the talk but ha not developed artistic vision . His reply about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about thing that are swept under the carpet , even his defence that there is little plot development because he did n't want to do a standard Hollywood movie - all are good answer to criticism , but unfortunately they do not apply to his film , any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates , or waste film while playing ineptly with symbol . Wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt , I spoke to him for a few minute after the screening , but I found him a distasteful a his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial . There are many truth . One aspect of art is to educate , another to entertain , another to inspire . I had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mention Ken Loach ( one of the many great name he take in vain ) without going so far a to admit any agenda himself . He then fall back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth . I am left with the feeling that this wa an overambitious project for a new director , or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work Andy Warhol could paint a tin of soup and it wa art . Clay Hugh would like to emulate the great director that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundary . Sadly , his ability at the moment only extends to making high-sounding excuse for a publicity-seeking film .",0
"I had heard good thing about this film and wa , you guessed it , a bit disappointed . Reese Witherspoon is a promised surprisingly good , surprisingly confident , at a young age ; really all the ( small ) cast are quite solid , in their simple 50 American setting . The reason I did n't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end , the grief shown by the older sister did n't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit . Perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot , or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer . Maureen 's character is quite underdeveloped I think . It is understandable that Dani ( Reese W. , the younger ) would be traumatised and angry , but why is her sister shown to be more upset ? Because she 's a few year older ? Has n't the end rather undermined the rest of the film ? The pacing of the movie make it seem that Maureen and Court have only just met , when he get tractored ( warning : this scene is surprisingly brutal , in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit . well it work ! ) . It depends what you want - if you want the girl ' happy story of young love that it seems like you 're going to get , you 're in for a surprise . Man in the Moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination ? I liked the character of Court though , I can see what girl watching this might be watching . And I loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister ( most men would , most film would n't ) and get killed . 7/10 on my pretty harsh rating scale . For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny .",1
"From the opening dialog and scene , I knew I knew I wa in for a train wreck . Did n't want to look , but could n't turn away . If it were n't for the meer eye candy of this film , I would have given one star . The fact that the interaction between character and relationship behavior were so far fetched , added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster . Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film . But this movie fails so horribly there wa no chance to rebound . If you were stuck out in the wood , your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease , other friend dying around you , stranded in a strange place , what would you do ? A . ) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own . B . ) Have sex with your friend girlfriend . C. ) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrow to include shaving your leg . D. ) Bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel . E. ) All of the above . According to Eli Roth , none of these answer are that far fetched . In fact , all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever . The total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situation throw this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store . Stay away . Stay far away .",0
"This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry . This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyer . Amitabh wa at the peak of his domination of Bollywood when his one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image yet again . Prakash ha the habit of picking theme and building story out of it , adding liberal dos of Bollywood sensibility and clichés to it . Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man . Lawaris wa about being a bastard and Namak Halal wa about the master-servant loyalty . But then , the theme wa limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hour of song , dance and drama . What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi who go to Mumbai and turn into a regulation hero . Amitabh 's vocal skill and diction saw this movie earn it big buck , thanks to his flawless stock Haryanvi accent . To me , this alone is the biggest pull in the movie . The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing . Amitabh , by now , had to have some typical comedy scene in each of his movie . Thanks to Manmohan Desai . This movie had a good dose of them . The shoe caper in the party , the monologue over Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare 's consideration , The mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now ha become a standard Amitabh fare . Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody , finicky character ( Remember him asking Ranjeet to `` Shaaadaaaap '' after the poisoned cake incident '' ) . His wa the all important role of the master while Amitabh wa his loyal servant . But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and so Shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie . It wa one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie . But this is a caper , remember ? And a long a it stayed that way , the people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy . The end is always predictable , and the good guy get the gal and the bad one go to the gaol , the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that end well . So what is it that make this movie a near classic ? Amitabh Bacchan a the Haryanvi . Prakash Mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story . Chuck the story , the character and the plot . My mark are for Amitabh alone .",1
"The Twins Effect - Chinese Action/Comedy - ( Charlene Choi , Gillian Chung ) This vampire action comedy is one of my favorite for the very fact that I wa thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie . First of all , the character are memorable , contributing a myriad of classic scene . Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute , charismatic , and humorous . This movie wa my first exposure to them , and all I wanted to do wa reach through my television screen and give them a REALLY BIG HUG . The remaining cast did well in their supporting role , including Jackie Chan , Karen Mok , `` The Duke '' , Josie Ho , Edison Chen , Anthony Wong , and the vampire bad guy ( one of which look eerily familiar to Will Ferrell ) . Even the abominably horrible Ekin Cheng wa good in this one . Good character are important , of course , because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping thing interesting between action sequence . And speaking of action , this film ha plenty of it . More importantly , there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography . One aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonist  a sword with a retractable spear-ended rope . This weapon , in and of itself , opened up a variety of move that would have been otherwise impossible . Josie Ho and Gillian Chung , in particular , perform some wicked aerial maneuver using these device . In addition , the swordplay is superb , and is highlighted by two great sword fight  one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale . In fact , the blade-wielding maneuver showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorite to great shame , and I truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in Ashes of Time , Storm Riders , or A Man Called Hero with the well-planned , precisely executed sequence seen in The Twins Effect . It 's not even close . I ca n't understand why this film get so much criticism . I 'm sure die-hard apologist for the Hong Kong `` Golden Age '' will hate this because it doe n't fit into their narrow-minded view of what Hong Kong action should be . We should learn from the downfall of John Woo - a one trick pony who never learned how to re-invent himself . We do n't need another clone . We need something different . The Twins Effect is one good example . This film wa so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other Chinese movie with the same actor and actress . This especially applies to Ekin Cheng , whose other film almost always suck  and yes , this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph . Even The Twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actress in a film , although they have managed to hit some good film when either one or the other take the leading role ( e.g. , Beyond Our Ken , Good Times Bed Times , House of Fury ) or when one or both are in supporting role ( e.g. , Colour of the Truth , New Police Story , Just One Look ) . The Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct sequel , instead of a family fantasy . I am still yearning to see Charlene and Gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie , but the fact remains that The Twins Effect hit on all cylinder , optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance ( a in Protégé de la Rose Noire ) . All in all , this film ha everything one need to be entertained . And may I remind the reader that it is precisely this  ENTERTAINMENT  that judge the greatness of a movie , more so than artsy dramatic element or meaningless award from established academy of critic who usually have no idea what they are talking about . In the end , the Twins Effect is a CLASSIC not to be missed . Rating = 5/5 star P.S .  The Hollywood exec decided to slaughter this film when it wa released in the U.S. by renaming it The Vampire Effect and cutting out 20 minute of footage , which includes part of the action scene . However , the final fight of the U.S. version doe have a better soundtrack than the original version . Therefore , I purchased both version , which allows me to first watch the original until about the 1:20 mark , and then swap disc to watch the final fight on the U.S. version .",1
"Terrible , boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than Uwe 's horrible first film . It consists of a group of soldier going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection . These soldier are your typical lamb to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out ( or at least are n't very interesting ) so you do n't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of . The film ha the typical zombie biting human and blood splatter . It even ha the same munching on gut . It just doe n't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory . And , the story 's climax is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous . One wonder how two people can submerged in an army of zombie and not get bit ( for they are the main star who seem to always manage escapability ) while others seem to get bit rather easily . The film sole motivation is to show people getting bit .. nothing else . Just go watch a Romero film for lasting effect .",0
"`` Piece is Cake '' is defeatist , revisionist history of the worst kind , whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the ( admittedly fictional ) pilot it portrays . It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth . In the March 1989 `` Aeroplane Monthly '' , Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that RAF Fighter Command wa portrayed in the TV mini-series . A few of his comment are worth repeating : `` There wa no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadron that I saw in action , and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'Piece of Cake ' . It would not have been tolerated for a moment ... ... The prevailing atmosphere wa more akin to that in a good rugby club , though with more discipline . Nor wa there any sense of 'death or glory ' . RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country , and now we were required to do it - no more and no le . `` There wa no discussion of 'bravery ' or 'cowardice ' . People either had gut or they did not - but mostly they did . But we knew fear , recognised it in ourselves and in each other , did our damnedness to control it , and then got on with the job ... `` ... I could feel no 'glory ' , but there wa a sense of greatness , and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'Piece of Cake ' . '' Beamont wa , in his own word , `` a fighter pilot who , unlike the author and producer of the recent TV series , wa there at the time '' . Beamont served with 87 Squadron both in France and the BoB , before going on to become one of the premier exponent of both the Typhoon and Tempest , and a post-war test pilot . `` Piece of Cake '' is an absolute , total misrepresentation of the way pilot in Fighter Command acted at the time . It is nothing le than a complete and utter disgrace ...",0

"This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie . Unhappy 'easterners ' are not pleased with being out west ; so they hire a drunk wagon master ( John Candy ) to lead them back east . Sight gag were just not funny enough to carry this one . And Richard Lewis get on your nerve very quickly ; but then I honestly do n't like him at anything he doe . Ed Lauter is hilarious a the bumbling villain . The movie wa dedicated to Candy . He died from a massive heart attack ten day before the movie wa completed .

"This show is absolutely fantastic . It provides all the great drama and romance of teen show like The OC and Dawsons , but it 's a whole lot funnier . It 's a show with moral and value , without everything being sugar coated and sanitised ( ala 7th Heaven . ) We do n't have sorority or fraternity in Australia , and our university system is completely different , so I have no idea how accurately Greek life is portrayed . But I do n't care ! Because this show is my new favourite ! Any writer that can make me love a racist , homophobe confederate flag-waving Bible basher must be genius . And Cappie is my new Pacey . Sorry Josh Jackson , you 've been dethroned !",1
"Okul '' The School '' is a result of a new trend in Turkish cinema . Having used the same story over and over again new generation director finally come up with different idea . Of course , it doe n't mean that they are all grand . I think Okul is one of them . It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not . It is not successful on being scary either . So what is it ? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role . I am sure it could have been better if it wa tried on harder . Maybe concentrating on one topic such a making it scary or vice versa . But director have missed the target this time . * * out of * * * * *",0
"Emma Thompson , Alan Rickman , Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are a DELIGHT in this sexy caper . This film is smart , edge of your seat entertainment for adult , and what a relief that is in these day of big concept predictable cartoon . Great music and camera work add to the fun that is this New Orleans-set puzzle . Highly Recommended . Ten star !",1
"I 'm going to review the 2 film a a whole because I feel that is how it should be considered , and watched . When I talk about 'the film ' I am talking about part 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other , a they should be . Thank you Jon Anderson , Steven Soderbergh & Benicio Del Toro . This film is a refreshing , bold , gritty and true film . And , it hearkens a new style of film making . No Faux drama . No Swelling sound track . Not Faux Documentary style . Just clean shot and an attempt to stick to the fact . I have been reading Jon Anderson 's `` Che Guevara : A Revolutionary Life '' and recently finished Fidel 's Auto biography , and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly . But I have to say that it is Jon Anderson 's exhaustive , penultimate and wonderful biography that ha given this film the proper historical back bone . Anderson wa consultant on this film ( or these 2 film ) . What make this film a true thing is that it is clean . No swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama , and even more importantly ; no fake documentary shaky camera . Just square shot and straight forward shooting style . The type of camera used make you feel right there in the jungle . Benicio Del Toro should be given full honor for this , I never doubted him a Che throughout the film ... not once . He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this . Some people complain that the film only deal with 2 slice of his life and not the whole . But I think this is one of the true beautiful aspect of this film : it doe n't try to be everything . It doe n't try to 'tell the story ' . A person 's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 or 32 hour . This is one of the subtle beauty of this film , it resists that temptation , and stay focused on the intent of letting u GET A FEEL FOR CHE , HIS DEVELOPING MILITARISTIC MIND AND THE FORCES AROUND HIM . It focus on 3 slice of time : The Battle to over throw Batista , Che 's U.N. speech and the Gorilla preparation in Bolivia . `` Motorcycle Diaries '' already told his young man side , and I applaud S. Soderbergh for focusing on other aspect instead . I keep referring to Jon Anderson 's book and the film stay true . The only weak link for me are the casting ( not the performance ) of Matt Damon . In a film so loaded with true to life performance , an American , ( Matt Damon ) playing a Bolivian is a clunky stretch - he doe well , but after so much care in the casting , this wa an over-site . Small and completely forgiven . The reality that the rest of the casting give you , and most notably Benicio Del Toro 's amazing job , put 's this film at the top of my list . The fact that this film went almost straight to video say 's something about how the cold war ethic that would never allow the 'revolutionized Cuba ' to become what it might have , are still at work keeping it 's story quiet . If not out of clandestine muffling , then out of the effect of properly done propaganda that ha prejudiced this topic . This is a must see film , and Jon Anderson 's `` Che Guevara : A Revolutionary Life '' is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effect on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess move of the 40 's , 50 's & 60 's that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbor , and the effect it fostered .",1
"In a variant of Sholay , Ram Gopal Verma venture into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster take a new shape . The Thakur go south.Mohanlal a Narsimha the police inspector whose family ha been killed seek vengeance Madrasi style . The accent is totally South Indian in contrast to Thakur from the north . The severing of the hand of Thakur by Gabbar is also cut down to the finger in Aag . So make up cost are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hand instead only a long shouldered Kurta cover up for the cut finger . Moreso in the climax where the Thakur us his leg and say '' Tere Liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai '' here Narsimha us his finger stub to fire a gun and kill the villain . Babban , the new avtar of gabbar is also different . He is not from Bihar or UP . He is Bambaiya . Gabbar 's infamous laugh is also in two instalment this time and is more subdued . Babban asks for Diwali instead of Holi and romance Urmila the replacement of Helen in Mehbooba . he also dance and enjoys dancing with Abhisheh who play Jalal Agha in Mehbooba.Babban is more intelligent this time . He toss the apple and asks the question that made Isaac Newton discover law of gravitation . Basanti is more verbose than the Auto driver Ghungroo . Nisha Kothari can not play the auto driver and look too artificial using word like 'entertain ' and 'too much ' with gay abandon . Viru wa fun whereas Ajay Devgun is a misfit for the role . The God Speaks to Basanti incident and the shooting lesson and the Koi Haseena song and the water tank sequence are painful . The water tank turn into a well and the drunk Devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide . Jai wa composed and serious . Prashant Raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him . But he also bungle on the Mausi sequence . He is not a romantic a Jai with the mouth organ . Jaya 's role played by Sushmita change career . A pure housewife turn into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed . She too lack the pain that Jaya displayed . Her flirtation with Jai are more open this time . Samba get a bigger role this time a Tambe . He doe not have to point gun and answer question of Gabbar this time . He follows Babban wherever he go and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den . Horses give way to Jeeps and auto . The Gabbar 's hideout here keep changing and Ramgarh becomes Kaliganj . All in all it is more of a spoof than anything else . RGV come up with his own interpretation of the classic . But we remember the original so well even after three decade that our mind refuse to accept stylized version and changed dialogue . So we call it a spoof . So Mr.RGV ( Sholay ) and Farhan Akhtar ( Don ) and JPDutta ( Umrao jaan ) stop making remixes and start making original .",0
"This show is a show that is great for adult and child to sit down together and watch . The story are a little slow for adult but they are still good . There are lot of child in my family , boy and girl , and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch , but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the Mystic Knights . It is a wonderful show and I hope that they will continue to keep making it . All of the kid in my family and myself think that Vincent Walsh is the best of them all . We have seen that he ha done lot of other work and think that he is doing a great job . We wish all of the actor , actress , writer , director , and producer the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work .",1
"The penultimate episode of Star Trek 's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season . Essentially , Spock , McCoy and Kirk beam down to Sarpeidon to find the planet 's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and Mr. Atoz , the librarian . All 3 Trek character soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different period of Sarpeidon 's past . Spock give a convincing performance a an Ice Age Vulcan who fall in love for Zarabeth while Kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel -- see the 'City on the Edge of Forever ' -- when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to Sarpeidon 's present . In the end , all 3 Trek character are saved mere minute before the Beta Niobe star around Sarpeidon go supernova . The Enterprise warp away just a the star explodes . Ironically , a William Shatner note in his book `` Star Trek Memories , '' this show wa the source of some dispute since Leonard Nimoy noticed that no reason wa given in Lisette 's script for the reason why Spock wa behaving in such an emotional way . Nimoy relayed his misgiving here directly to the show 's executive producer , Fred Freiberger , that Vulcans were n't supposed to fall in love . ( p.272 ) However , Freiberger reasoned , the ice age setting allowed Spock to experience emotion since this wa a time when Vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state . This wa a great example of improvisation on Freiberger 's part to save a script which wa far above average for this particular episode . While Shatner note that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt Spock artistically since his character wa forced to bray like a donkey in `` Plato 's Stepchildren , '' play music with Hippies in `` the Way to Eden '' or sometimes display emotion , the script here wa more believable . Spock 's acting here wa excellent a Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner . ( p.272 ) The only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both Spock and McCoy travelled thousand of year back in time , McCoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state , not just Spock . But this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 show , the brilliant Spock/McCoy performance and the originality of this script . Who could have imagined that the present inhabitant of Sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet 's fate by travelling into their past ? This is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'Classic Trek ' -- a genuinely inspired story . Shatner , in 'Memories ' , named some of his best `` unusual and high quality show '' of season 3 a The Enterprise Incident , Day of the Dove , Is there in Truth no Beauty , The Tholian Web , And the child Shall Lead and The Paradise Syndrome . ( p.273 ) While my personal opinion is that 'And the child Shall Lead ' is a very poor episode while 'Is there in Truth no Beauty ' is problematic , `` All Our Yesterdays '' certainly belongs on the list of top season three Star Trek TOS film . I give a 9 out of 10 for 'All Our Yesterdays . '",1
"Really do n't care that no one on here like this movie , , i do , and that 's what this review is about . Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comedic role . that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic , the cg is great , yeah train look a little fake , , but the alien wow do they ever rock , , Todd Bridges , , where 's Arnold , and Mr. Drummond , , wow he 's been out of the loop , guess that 's what jail doe to you .. a bullet train is on it 's way to Las Vegas with the Senator for him to deliver a big speech , a meteor ha just hit , , and now all of a sudden we got alien running loose aboard the train , and our hero cop ha to save the day , to make matter worse his ex-wife is on board arguing with him . i just thought this movie wa so wonderful , , a must see if you like action .",1
"I bought this film a I thought the cast wa decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit . First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard . Stephen Baldwin make his character look almost retarded at time and at other time morose . Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scene , and the supposed poetry she spout in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish . Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film . Ms Rubins Character is at first innocent , then sexy , a she play Stephen Baldwin 's Character ( Travis ) for a fool . The supporting cast includes Adam Baldwin ( no relation to his more famous namesake ) & M.Emmet Walsh who ha appeared in many film , also I noticed Art Evans who wa one of John Mclane 's ally in Die Hard 2 . The Movie is decent and there are a few nude scene with Rubin & Kensit , a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller . There is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and Stephen Balwin 's character is wearing sunglass and when you see him again , the area around his eye etc is painted black instead , then the sunglass reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit , a very obvious error in editing . If you are fan of either of the lady or either Baldwin then you may find something to like here , but others should steer clear . This is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollar if you want it .",0
"Screwball comedy about romantic mismatch in New York City . Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the woman in his picture -- he revere them -- yet Audrey Hepburn is ( naturally ) put a notch above the others because , after all , she 's the princess Bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movie 30 year prior . He shoot her in loving close-ups , get right in the sheet between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled Ben Gazzara , and allows her room to sparkle throughout . The love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing , though I did tire of John Ritter 's TV-styled klutziness . Colleen Camp , Dorothy Stratten , and the grounded , earthy-sensual Patti Hansen are all exciting to watch . But it 's really Hepburn 's valentine and she absolutely glow . * * * from * * * *",1
"Who me ? No , I 'm not kidding . That 's what it really say on the video case . Plot ; short version : Pretty woman stand around smiling . This , for some reason , make all men kill each other . `` Find Ariel ... Where 's Ariel ... Ca n't Find Ariel ... '' She 's right behind you , you idiot ... Most of what can be said about this horrendous little Space Opera ha already been said , look like . A bunch of corny actor playing mostly convict come in after the first selection of actor is knocked off very quickly . Then they get knocked off in the same way . Every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minute in advance . Perhaps it wa a drawing of straw to see which actor had the most screen time and bigger pay check . The alien virus/hologram/VR witch/glitch seems physically powerless and doe n't do a thing . Why ca n't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her `` teleporting vampire '' routine ? ( Actually , it would 've been more interesting if she had been a vampire , or doing more than just standing around looking at people , which is all she ever doe . This is enough to make all the men kill each other . Go figure ... ) This is n't really a space flick . There are far more shot of the old western trail , 1950 's Easy Rider trail , Film noir 's night club scene , even a jog on the beach in fantasy-land , none of which ha any real depth or even make any sense . The night club scene is in black and white , of course . Worked with `` The Wizard of Oz '' . Does n't work so well , here . This is probably a good thing , a those few shot they DO show of space are depressingly silly . You will probably cry during those moment , especially upon seeing that swirling `` space ship '' , which look about three inch long . Nothing is felt for any of the character , not because they are convict or have no personality , but because they are in serious need of acting lesson , except for Billy Dee Williams who really doe look depressed and at a loss , probably by being in this work ... This is one of those movie that , when viewed with friend , is going to cause some extremely `` loud '' silence , especially when the nerd throw out his attempt at comic one-liner ( including the line about French-kissing a meteor ... ? Did I hear that right ? Perhaps not ... ) The original virtual reality girl get `` killed '' , which mean nothing , a they are not even real to begin with . Well , the other `` character '' are n't , either , but that 's beside the point . Haha . What 's kind of funny is that the scene that grace the video case is some sort of skull-horror-alien looking thing ( green filter added on top of that , to give it more of a ... uh ... green look ) , which is actually the android after he get killed and ultimately ha nothing to do with anything else afoot . Another odd deal I noticed . Whenever there is an explosion ( at least on my cheap DVD copy ) , everything becomes highly pixelated . I do n't mean a LITTLE pixelated , I mean HUGE block about 1/16th the size of the screen . Wow .",0
"This wa a fantastic movie about two people , one a young teenage girl , and the other , a middle aged man , who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved one . Both actor give brilliant performance that various audience can relate to . The script , although written by Gorman Bechard , seems a though it wa written from a woman 's point of view . And at the same time , men can relate to the male character because of how well they were developed and described in the movie . The end of the movie ha an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaf you speechless . I would recommend this film to anyone who ha ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one . It is clear in this film that you are not alone .",1
"Actually , this is a lie , Shrek 3-D wa actually the first 3d animated movie . I bought it on DVD about 3 year ago . Did n't Bug 's Life also do that ? I think it wa at Disneyworld in that tree , so I 'm saying before they go and use that a there logo . Also , Shrek 3d wa a motion simulator at Universal Studios . They should still consider it a a movie , because it appeared in a `` theater '' and you could buy it for DVD . The movie wa cute , at least the little flyes were . I liked IQ . I agree with animaster , they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure . I recommend it to family and kid .",0
"Busy Phillips put in one hell of a performance , both comedic and dramatic . Erika Christensen wa good but Busy stole the show . It wa a nice touch after The Smokers , a movie starring Busy , which wasnt all that great . If Busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster . Forget Mona Lisa Smile , see Home Room .",1
"Why ca n't there be better TV movie made I wa at a loose end today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the UK . What a terrible waste of my time it wa . Poor set , Poor acting & Oh my god what a terrible flood . Blimey that woman can even outrun a torrent of water too ! . I really wish that people would make TV movie using better effect , better or at least more believable plot & far better acting . Killer Flood is well up there with poor acting . A few bit of ham could n't act any worse . 1 final thing I really agree with the comment about the dog , but I believe it would of already scarpered in real life !",0
"There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting , plot , effect , continuity , etc . - and that word is poor . The government want to ass the effect of space travel on certain organism but the capsule crash and a mutant something-or-other ( look like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face ) wreaks havoc around the accident scene , which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging , partying set . Therefore , some young people - a well a a law enforcement officer - are among the creature 's victim . You got ta be extremely unparticular about how you spend your time - or rich , if you spend any money - to view this epic .",0
"My mother and I were on our way home from a trip up to the North East ( mainly Massachusetts ) when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in Boston . Now , I do n't know much about film so I thought this might be a bit educational . The first movie we saw wa this one , THE ROMEO DIVISION . Now , I do n't know about you but I thought this wa great ! I 'm from Texas and where I come from we do n't see too many motion picture so this wa a pleasant surprise . My mother insisted that it wa too violent , but said that I did n't know much about what she wa saying but this wa a great picture . I wa shocked by the fight sequence they were great . Also , I am a big fan when the good guy win so I wa thrilled when Romeo lady killed all of the bad guy . This wa true brilliance . I 'm not sure when it 's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised . A word to the wise though , it is rather violent and there many cuss word so you may not want to let your child watch . It 's more for adult .",1
"In New York , Andy Hanson ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is an addicted executive of a real estate office that ha embezzled a large amount for his addiction and expensive way of life with his wife Gina ( Marisa Tomei ) . When an audit is scheduled in his department , he becomes desperate for money . His baby brother Hank Hanson ( Ethan Hawke ) is a complete loser that owes three month of child support to his daughter , and is having a love affair with Gina every Thursday afternoon . Andy plot a heist of the jewelry of their parent in a Saturday morning without the use of gun , expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parent , since the insurance company would reimburse the loss . On Monday morning , we would raise the necessary money he need to cover his embezzlement . He invite Hank to participate , since he is very well known in the mall where the jewelry is located and could be recognized . However , Hank yellow and invite the thief Bobby Lasorda ( Brian F. O'Byrne ) to steal the store , but thing go wrong when their mother Nanette ( Rosemary Harris ) come to work a the substitute for the clerk and Bobby brings a hidden gun . Nanette reacts and kill Bobby but she is also lethally shot . After the death of Nanette , their father Charles Hanson ( Albert Finney ) decides to investigate the robbery with tragic consequence . `` Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead '' is a comedy of error , disclosing a good story . The originality and the difference are in the screenplay , with a non-linear narrative à la `` Pulp Fiction '' . The eighty-three year-old Sidney Lumet ha another great work and it is impressive the longevity of this director . Philip Seymour Hoffman is awesome in the role of a dysfunctional man with traumatic relationship with his father that feel the world falling apart mostly because of his insecure and clumsy brother . Marisa Tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy , showing a magnificent body . The violent conclusion show that the world is indeed an evil place . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Antes Que o Diabo Saiba Que Você Está Morto '' ( `` Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead '' )",1

"I usually like these dumb/no brain activity movie , but this wa just too stupid . There were way too many clichés and the plot did n't really make much sense . There were a lot of loose end and the ending wa extremely poor and abrupt . We did n't even get too see if the big master plan worked . We only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther , the professor ( that died because of stupidity ( see below ) ) . One scene annoyed me particularly . Why did the professor only have about 5 minute of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam ? And if they only had oxygen container containing 5 minute worth of oxygen , why did n't he bring two or three of them ? Then he would have survived that wa bloody stupid . The movie is pretty full of such stupid thing . I can not recommend it at all .",0
"I like science-fiction movie and even , low-rated , made for TV , bargain bin , movie I may still find interesting . Well , I found this one in a bargain bin and brought it a a selection to a movie night with a group of friend . I wa , literally , * emabrrassed * that I brought this movie . Right from the beginning , the acting is bad , the story is bland and the plot is almost non-existent . All this lead right to what the movie really wa : A soft core porno graphical movie . The movie started with a woman prison where the prisoner are all sexy woman working in some sort of mine . First clue that this movie is NOT serious : attractive woman in a prison being forced to do physical labor . Yeah , right ! Whatever . : P Once the `` plot '' continued , it wa overshadowed by pointless scene of people having sex . Halfway through the movie , my friend and I stopped watching , it wa so stupid . The next day , I thought that I would give the movie another chance and watch the rest . I watched about another 15 minute and gave up again . If you are looking for a decent , science-fiction or even a sci-fi monster movie DO NOT watch Lethal Target ! If you want to see a low-budget , soft core porn that is light on plot , then see Lethal Target .",0
"My scalp still smart from the burning coal heaped on it when I vowed I love this film . Bring on the coal ; I 'll walk over them a well to say again that I love `` Bend it Like Beckham . '' Granted , there 's a lot of `` in spite of '' in that confession . It 's a bit movie-of-the-week ; the screenplay is on the paint-by-numbers side . And , most troublingly , the director 's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin . The film 's genius is not in what 's obvious to the Syd Field-doctored eye : character arc , theme , construction . It 's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath , but not in those layer of artistic topsoil that reviewer seem most often to scratch at . Powerful , sometimes semi-clad female body not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi will ever do . These are real body ( Keira Knightley 's excepted ) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later . They are working body whose beauty is in their movement and self-determination . And , in my book , lead actress Parminder Nagra is one of the most gorgeous creature ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective , `` luminous , '' but because her performance ha an honesty and un-bookish intelligence that 's utterly compelling . The result is a film woman can enjoy without feeling like they 're making a pact with the devil to do so . As in Chadha 's `` Bride and Prejudice , '' the relationship amongst woman sizzle with a chemistry that ca n't be neatly slotted into the stodgy , Sweet Valley High category of `` best friend '' or `` sister . '' Perhaps Chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film 's flirtation with lesbianism . `` Bend it Like Beckham '' ha an electricity that ca n't be reduced to the simple hetero/homosexual love triangle it conventionally structured script would suggest . The precise nature of it pleasure is , ultimately , a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for it . Oh yes , and did I mention that it 's hilarious ?",1
"The Second Renaissance , part 1 let 's u show how the machine first revolted against the human . It all start of with a single case , in which the machine claim that they have a right to live a well , while the human state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want . Although an interesting premise , the story get really silly from then on with ( violent ! ) riot between the robot and mankind . Somehow it doe n't seem right , a another reviewer point it , it 's all a little too clever . The animatrix story that stay close to the core of the matrix ( in particular Osiris ) work for the best . As for Second Renaissance Part 1 , I 'd say it 's too violent and too silly . 4/10 .",0
"This wa great . When I saw the Japanese version first , it wa probably the scariest movie I had ever seen . It wa not blood and gut , it wa eerie , atmospheric and terrifying . When the mother ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version , I nearly had a heart attack ... I wa concerned that the American version would be watered down , and that Buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuance of the original version . I need n't have been concerned . The maker of this movie wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand , and gave the direction of the movie to the same man . They also set it in Japan in the same location , in the same house . In fact , the Japanese director took pain to remake the same movie a it wa in the original , the only difference wa the casting of American actor . That actually turned into a benefit a it added the element of `` Strangers in a Strange Land '' to the overall horror . Not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost , but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land , having difficulty integrating into society . It just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it wa an excellent touch . Buffy actually doe a very good job . She look vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well . There are none of the smart aleck remark that are so common to American horror movie , or one liner that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the character ' situation . In fact , it wa easily a good a The Ring which I also thoroughly enjoyed . I hope the future of American horror follows more closely the Japanese New Wave of horror started with the incredible success of Ringu . We are finally getting movie that actually can be categorized a `` Horror '' ! ! 8/10",1
"At the surface COOLEY HIGH is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading a a period piece ( set in the early 60 's , complete with a flawless Motown soundtrack ) . But there 's SO much more to this film - it get better every time I see it . The cast of unknown ( at the time ) is excellent , and it is notable a an all-black-cast film that doe n't fall into any Blaxpoitation clichés - at time COOLEY HIGH almost feel like an updated , urban neo-realist film , with lot of edgy humor added in . At time , the rather tight budget doe show , but the constraint actually serve the film well - there 's a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar-minded film ( like Schultz ' later CAR WASH , which wa more popular , but largely pointless ) Warm-hearted but also true-to-life , this might be one of THE sleeper of the 70 - celebrated at the time , it seems that few film freak know about this one today . Their loss - this is a fine , fine film . The bare-bones pan-and-scan DVD ( no widescreen ! ? ! ) is testament to just how little cared-for this excellent film is .",1
"`` Thunderbolt '' is probably Jackie Chan 's worst movie since `` The Protector '' in 1985 . Yes , I know that nobody watch his movie for their story , but the plotting of this one is unusually lame , even by his standard , and while the fight choreography IS up to his standard , the fight scene ( the whole two of them ) are ruined , a others have mentioned , by the frenetic , distracting camerawork . Even the most serious Jackie Chan fan should n't really bother with this offensively haphazard , stunt-and-plug-filled garbage . Anita Yuen 's cute and perky performance is one of the few redeeming virtue . For a good `` serious Jackie '' movie , I recommend `` Crime Story '' . ( * 1/2 )",0
"Okay , there are a ton of review here , what can I possibly add ? I will try anyway . The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing . The set , outdoor location , costume are so beautiful and authentic . The music is sweet . The supporting cast is very well done . One of my favorite is the narrator & nephew , played by Roger Rees . His understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me . David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit . His is a difficult life , but he remains positive and dignified . The best part of course- is George C. Scott a Ebenezer Scrooge . Some have said his portrayal too gruff . I could n't disagree more . His exchange at the beginning while cold or harsh , were n't out of character . He is a terribly disillusioned man who 's heart ha been hardened by the vicissitude of life and his own lust for wealth . During the flashback , it 's obvious that he is n't all gruff . This is where we see that there is hope for him . If he wa totally gone , his partner Marley would never have come for his sake in the first place . And after all , we are none of u past hoping . I think that is a HUGE part of what Dickens wa trying to say . When Scrooge look in on his dance at his employer 's with Belle , you see him smile regretfully a he tell Belle in the flashback that he will go through life `` with a grin on my face . '' Clive Donner wa smart enough a the director to allow these moment on film . Sometimes they get left on the editing room floor . And finally , his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it make me cry tear of joy EVERY time I see it . His apology to his nephew Fred , so sincere , so moving , it is the spirit not only of Christmas , but of humanity itself . The joy he brings to Fred , to his wife are so apparent . And the line that get me every time , `` God forgive me for the time I 've wasted . '' Bravi tutti !",1
"I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It wa a great experience which show up on the screen . Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and wa able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film . The set are amazing and well crafted for each character . John York and his team built set that not only fit the character , they worked well in shooting the film , allowing u to move seamlessly through wall and from one set to another . Each character ha an amazing arc , which make for a great story . I feel like all of the actor gave excellent performance . I disagree with some of the other comment that say the acting wa not good . Watch it and decide for yourself .",1
"Jay Craven 's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film . First off , the photography is pure aesthetic pleasure , capturing all of the gloomy beauty of Northern New England in late autumn ( Cinematographer Paul Ryan did 2nd Unit on Malick 's Days of Heaven ) . Second , the performance are uniformly excellent - Rip Torn 's Noel Lourdes is irascibly charming and Tantoo Cardinal 's Bangor is at once sensitive and exuberant , to say nothing of a fine supporting cast . Overall though , it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in it own time , and the film come to a conclusion , natural and genuine , that nevertheless doe not seem expected . This is one of the rare cell of dignity in the independent film world , a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between human and history .",1
"Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage , I have stumbled across this little treasure . Action , romance , crooked cop , violence . Its all here and not a single one ha been pulled of right . I wa in love immediately . Then , a funny thing happened about the second time around . I became addicted . I thought it wa going to be a one rent and chuckle kind-of-movie . Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie . He did n't have the money to make it look good , but he did it anyway . That 's very commendable . It also show he wa making the movie for his self . I do n't know how many of you have heard Rudy Ray 's music , but if you have n't he ha a whole slew of album reaching into the fifty .",1
"As usual , Hollywood stereotyped EVERYONE in the movie . But , this one is a classic - from the uptight white collar banker to the Russian woman ! ! Well done . Even facial expression were great ! Language wa perfect ( even in Russian language ) and Nicole did a splendid job ! ! Hey guy - you get what you pay for : )",1
"I recently watched Belle Epoque , thinking it might be wonderful a it did win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film . I wa a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film . Maybe the conflict I had wa that from the time the movie wa filmed to now , the plot of a man falling for beautiful woman and eventually falling for the good girl ha been done so many time . Aside from predictability of the plot , some scene in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ( ex . a certain event at the wedding ) . At time the film wa a bit preachy in it 's idea and in relation to the Franco era the film wa set in and the Church . The only thing the film had going for it wa the cutesy moment , the scenery , and the character of Violeta being a strong , independent woman during time when woman were not really associated with those characteristic .",0
"In life , we first organize stone ( Piedras in Spanish ) such a a career , family , friendship , and love . In this way , we shall find space between these to fit smaller stone , our small necessity . If you act in an inverse way , you will not have enough room for larger stone . The five protagonist in this film are woman who have not been able to organize the large `` stone '' in their life . Ramon Salazar , a Spanish motion picture director defines his first feature Stones in this way . The film tell the parallel , conflicting trajectory of five woman : Anita ( Monica Cervera , 1975- ) , Isabel ( Angela Molina , 1955- ) , Adela ( Antonia San Juan , 1961- ) , Leire ( Najwa Nimri , 1972- ) , and Maricarmen ( Vicky Pena , 1954- ) .All are endeavoring to remove the stone that insistently appear in their path or , worst , that are in their shoe . They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life . The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita ( Monica Cervera ) who also star in `` 20 Centimeters , '' `` Busco , '' `` Crimen Ferpecto , '' `` Entre Vivir y Sonar , '' `` Hongos , '' and `` Octavia .

"I put down this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy , and Murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again , recently , I can see that it doe have some very funny bit . This is by no mean to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time , but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre ? What director , Tom Dey , ha tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the medium . Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks : `` How is this different from Cops ? `` , when Chase Renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with De Niro 's character , Mitch Preston ( hilariously boring name by the way ) . That 's when I saw it in a new light that I had n't previously noticed . The idea is to show all the element of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them . De Niro 's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with Murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of . You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself asking : `` Why would I do another movie playing a cop ? '' Chase Renzi is portrayed to be a Hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again , she is merely doing it to save her job . She somehow see the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she want to succeed despite that . One line say it all : `` Who doe n't want to be on TV ? '' Maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film , merely set to entertain , but it doe give it a little spin that I had n't noticed before . As for Murphy . You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous . Trey want to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he come in contact with . Murphy wa a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting . The plot with the gun is of course pretty boring . The action sequence are nothing special , except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew . One thing that I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80 's pop star . George Michael come to mind and that add to the whole medium spin . So , I trashed it the first time around but what the heck ; if you are gon na do this , why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy took a big chance doing this .",0
"There are few film or movie I consider favorite over the year . The Gospel road wa one of them . I watched this a a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again . My favorite part were the fact that 1/Jesus wa blond , 2/the last supper wa a huge meal , 3/ he liked playing with the child , 4/His death wa for all people and for all time . The movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting , but it touched my heart at that time . Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it wa a brave venture . If it ever come out on DVD , I will purchase it purely for sentimental reason .",1
"1936 wa the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers . Their second film for RKO that year is the third film in this collection  Mark Sandrich 's 'Follow The Fleet . ' This time out Astaire is painfully uncomfortable a Bake Baker , a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront café where Sherry Martin ( Rogers ) is warbling romantic sweet nothing in everyone 's ear . Yep , you guessed it  they 're hot for each other once again . Only this time Sherry 's spinster sister , Connie ( Harriet Hillard ) threatens the whole fine romance by falling for Bake 's robust seafaring buddy , Bilge Smith ( Randolph Scott ) ; a sort of use 'em up and toss 'em out kind of guy , thus forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailor in general . Irving Berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceeding with his classic , classy score , including standard 'Let Yourself Go ' , ' I 'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket ' and 'Let 's Face the Music and Dance ; ' the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turn into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pa deux for Fred and Ginger . The transfer on 'Follow The Fleet ' is a tad weaker . The gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it 's a tad thick looking with not nearly a much tonal variation a the previous title . Grain is still present . So are age related artifact . Once you 've settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality , the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage . The audio is Mono but very nicely balanced . Extras include a featurette , theatrical trailer and short subject , but oddly  no audio commentary . Considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of Astaire/Rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from Warner Home Video .",1
"`` Soylent Green '' is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movie of the 70 's and still very persuasive even by today 's standard . Although flawed and a little dated , the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise ( typical for that time ) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking . This film 's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flick because of it strong cast and some intense sequence that I personally consider classic . The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive , with over-population , unemployment , an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product . The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company . Charlton Heston ( in a great shape ) play a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent 's most eminent executive and he stumble upon scandal and dark secret ... The script is a little over-sentimental at time and the climax doe n't really come a a big surprise , still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny . The riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moment in 70 's cinema . Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there 's a great ( but too modest ) supportive role for Joseph Cotton ( `` Baron Blood '' , `` The Abominable Dr. Phibes '' ) . THIS is Science-Fiction in my book : a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity ! No fancy space-ships with hairy monster attacking our planet .",1
"... but the trouble of this production is that it 's very far from a good musical . Granted , one ca n't always expect the witty master like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter ; yet the music of this piece make even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty . It 's deadly dull and uninventive ( with one or two exception ) and just after I watched it I could n't recall a single significant melody - which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole Another Hundred People from three listening . It is also strangely un-theatrical . It take place on an incredibly large stage ( one really ha to feel sorry for those people in front row who broke their neck in order to see something happening 50 meter on the right or 100 meter on the left ) and doe absolutely nothing with it . When there 's supposed to be one person singing on-stage , that 's just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty . For me a an aspiring theatre director it wa almost painful to watch . The fact remains , Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his work better than these no-talents can ever come close to . And I 'm puzzled by the popularity of this would-be-legendary musical .",0
"And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself . No matter how it evolved ( at point being a movie about disco ) , it ended up a one of the ultimate movie in which kid want to rock out , but the principal stand in their way . Think back to those rock'n'roll movie of the 50 's in which the day is saved when Alan Freed come to town with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for the kid , and Tuesday Weld get a new sweater for the dance . Forward to the 1979 , repeat the same plot , but throw in DA RAMONES , whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential band of the next quarter century ( and then for the obligatory DJ guest shot , `` The Real '' Don Steele ) . Throw in , too , all the element of a Roger Corman-produced comedy-exploitation film , except for the two-day shooting schedule , some of the familiar Corman repertory player like Clint Howard , Mary Wournow and Dick Miller ( there since `` Bucket of Blood '' ) , and you 've got one of the great stoopid movie of the day . One of the few film that us deliberate cheesiness and get away with it . I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing part of it through a stoner- induced haze at the drive-in , and he agreed that this is one of the great movie to be watching drunk , not the least for the lovely leading lady and the great Ramones footage .",1
"After visiting the Kimbell museum in Forth-Worth , Texas , USA , enjoying the art and the architecture ( also of the adjacent Modern Art Museum ) , and having a delightful conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady , I purchased this a propos DVD with rather high expectation and wa not disappointed in the least . The thematic approach , dramatic tension , revealing interview , archival footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic Louis I. Khan . The documentary begin : contemplative classical music play , archive are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed , blurring letter symbolically referencing a train window passing a backdrop landscape  a journey  , focus and out of focus , the search eventually culminates to an article in a newspaper . Nathanial Khan read from the front page of the New York Times where his father is simultaneously praised a the best American architect alive and his death announced . `` When I first read that obituary , I have to admit , I wa looking for my own name . I wa his child too , his only son . I did n't know my father very well . He never married my mother and he never lived with u ( ) He died when I wa eleven . '' So year later , this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thought and feeling about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure , but who 's secretive personal life escape him and affect him to the point where he intends to do something about it . `` For year , I struggled to be satisfied with the little piece of my father 's life I 've been allowed to see , but it wa n't enough . I needed to know him . I needed to find out who he really wa . So I set out on a journey , to see his building and to find whatever there wa left of him out there . It would take me to the other side of the world , looking for the man who left me with so many question . '' So the documentary is two-fold , by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renown architect , we get to know : 1 ) his idea , building and the architectural perspective and 2 ) his family , coworkers , people 's life he affected and the human perspective The DVD also offer added insight with a Q & A with the writer/director and additional footage that includes such great Louis I. Khan quote a `` Everything that everybody say is the truth . It 's their truth . It might not be factual . '' and `` A good idea that doe n't happen is no idea at all . '' This movie is a journey of discovery . Self-discovery and discovery of a man , a great man , yet a human , imperfect like all of u . We get to know him through the eye of an admiring and slightly bitter son , but with the openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusion and without judging . By key interview with people who interacted with him in various capacity . We slowly put some piece together until that final interview with this man from Bangladesh who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comment . Brilliant architect , brilliant documentary .",1
"I hope the people who made this movie read these comment . The choreography wa horrid , the plot wa nill , and the actor where so low budget power ranger appears 5 star to this junk . The fight scene where so slow you could actually see the actor waiting for each other to perform the next move . Camera cut-aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effect . The lightning wa just plain stupid . The weapon looked like something out of a final fantasy game , and the dual bow and arrow wa just dull a anything I have ever seen . Next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics , better script and try actually spending some time on your stunt . Honestly there are show on t.v . that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hour that look better than this one . Stick to martial art ( unless it a poor a your acting ) then take up quilting .",0
"Bela Lugosi get to play one of his rare good guy role in a serial based upon the long running radio hit ( which wa also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain . ) Lugosi cut a fine dashing figure and it sad that he did n't get more role where he could be the guy in command in a good way . Here Chandu return from the East in order to help the Princess Nadji who is being hunted by the leader of the cult of Ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult . This is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun . To be certain the pacing is a bit slack , more akin to one of Principals ( the producing studio ) feature then a rip roaring adventure , but it 's still enjoyable . This play better than the two feature film that were cut from it because it allows for thing to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that `` hey I missed something '' . One of the trilogy of three good serial Lugosi made , the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps",1
"A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore . However , it is not an excuse for poor writing . It is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical . The dialog in this movie wa on par with most instructional video shown to fast food staff in training . I also understand that one must make a few exception when it come to acting talent when you only have 20 buck to spend on it . With that being said , no serious director would have looked at these scene and said to himself , `` that wa perfect '' . I see better character acting on Canadian television . This movie had a paper thin plot , bad acting , poor dialog and hold no intelligent idea at all . This simply prof to me that some independent film are that way for a reason . If your looking for a quick scare , rent anything else . Even the `` Cable Guy '' wa a scarier film . After watching this film , I think i would have been better off watching a re-run on the X-files .",0
"A very sweet movie about a young Chinese man enamored of western technology and an Englishman trying to make his fortune showing movie in China . It 's a very interesting story that is presumably based on true event , although I 'm assuming it 's more fantasy than real . It 's got a fairy tale quality you rarely get in real life , and it 's also got 8 people credited for the script , so they must have been making up stuff right and left . This is a very likable movie that conveys how magical film wa to people who had never seen it before . It is not an especially deep movie , touching briefly on the loss of tradition and the encroachment of western culture but mainly just being a pleasant little movie . It 's actually a movie I enjoyed very much that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minute after seeing it . Light a a soufflé , but I enjoyed every minute .",1
"There are n't many good thing to say at all about Underneath , Soderbergh 's untrue endeavor into neo-noir . Soderbergh remake Robert Siodmak 's decent noir Criss-Cross faithfully , not altering the plot very much at all , however the adaptation drain it of every ounce of it state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere , giving it the same story set in the very least appealing place , lifestyle and anachronism . Soderbergh , who would later make wonderful crime film like Out of Sight and the Ocean 's series with great style and atmosphere , take the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest , dullest and flattest fashion of the early 1990s . Nightclubs have terrible , revoltingly dressed garage band , Peter Gallagher 's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster 's anti-hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliance like stereo , TVs , and other up to date piece of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film . It could 've been more entertaining and le boring had it a few saving grace like a good score , more flesh to it character , more than just William Fichtner giving performance that are n't wooden , a crisper pace . Unfortunately , Underneath ha none of these thing . Soderbergh , a fine director , doe not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time . That disposition work wonderfully when he 's helming a crime movie with more tongue in it cheek like the George Clooney picture previously mentioned , or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex , lie and videotape . With a movie like Underneath , it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer .",0
"`` Tokyo Eyes '' tell of a 17 year old Japanese girl who fall in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop . This lame flick is about 50 % filler and 50 % talk , talk , and more talk .

Only the dumb Russian cop , Vlad , wa a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys.The pile of muscle wa so incredibly STUPID , that it made me laugh at him for a moment .

"I 'm not sure what Diane Silver wa thinking when she wa making this movie , but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright 's novel , which the movie is based on . We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12 , and just watched the film . During periodic note-taking and checking of the clock , I contemplated the chance of being struck by lightning . Of course , the sky wa completely clear , and I wa forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it . Wright 's novel discussed very real theme , of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it . Silver 's movie turned a murderer into a victim , which is NOT what Wright wanted ( see : `` How Bigger wa Born '' 454 ) . I 'm going to make this short and sweet : if you want to leave your consciousness , in Raphael Lambert 's word , unsullied , skip the movie and read the book . The 1986 adaptation is not thought-provoking material . ... : :sigh : : Now I have to write the essay .",0
"This started out to be a movie about the street culture of the Bronx in New York . What it accomplished wa to give birth to a new culture and way of life , for American youth . What other movie ha done this except Rebel Without A Cause ? One of the most important movie of all time . The element are simple yet fascinating . The story is timeless , young people try to succeed against all odds . Yet the story is always believable and never depressing . The character are so realistic , a city dweller , would recognize them a neighbor . The story is entertaining , and come to a satisfying ending . Buy this one for your permanent collection . It is a piece of American history .",1
"I just watched this film 15 minute ago , and I still have no idea what I just watched . Mainly I think it 's a film about an internet S & M `` star '' of CD Roms that are about a realistic a flash cartoon online . She 's murdered by someone , which cause her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agent to investigate the death . The local homicide division of Big City , USA is also investigating , though most of his work come by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claim are a realistic `` a the real thing '' . I know . Wow . Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that ha any kind of credit behind him . He 's in the film for about 15 minute , and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason . I wo n't even explain the ending , because quite frankly I ca n't make it out myself . But before the final scene , we 're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film . Honestly , they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all . All in all , stay away from this film . I got it because I love bad movie and I love Michael Madsen . I really could have used that 80 some minute on something else and have been more satisfied . Like , playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly . That for 80 minute would be much more entertaining .",0

"This 1953 Sam Fuller movie contains some of his best work , and it sad that he could n't continue to get the backing of major Hollywood studio to do his stuff . The story line go something like this . A tough hard broad ( read prostitute ) is riding the subway one hot summer day , and get her pocketbook picked by Skip McCoy . What Skip ( and the dame ) do n't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spy . This opening shot without dialogue , and mostly in tight close-ups is a beaut , one of the many that Fuller us throughout the movie . Playing the babe known a Candy is Jean Peters , who wa never better nor better looking . One forgets how beautiful she wa , and she handle this role very well . The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark , who had already made his mark , and set his style with 1947 's Kiss Of Death a the crazy creep with the creepy laugh , and although he 's a little `` softer '' here , he 's still scary . These hard edged character do have soft spot here and there , but it noir and nasty all the way . The standout performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter , who play Moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral . Ritter received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her performance , but lost out to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed a the B girl ( read prostitute ) in `` From Here To Eternity . '' Hollywood love it when a good girl go bad , and love to Oscar them even though their performance is usually awful . See for instance Shirley Jones in `` Elmer Gantry . Set among the dock and dive of New York City , with crisp black and white photography by the great Joe MacDonald , and some very good art direction . Especially good is the set representing the New York City subway and Widmark 's shack near the river . Made at the height of the cold war and red scare , the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie , played by Richard Kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal American .",1
"I loved this movie , I saw it when I wa about 8 year old and almost seven year later , this evening I got to see it again . I really thought it had an interesting idea , they only thing that upset me wa the ending which I felt wa a cop out .

"Originally filmed in 1999 a a TV pilot , `` Mulholland Dr. '' wa rejected . The next year , David Lynch received money to film new scene to make the movie suitable to be shown in theater . He did so - and created one of the greatest , most bizarre and nightmarish film ever made . The film really doe n't have main character , but if there were main character , they would be Betty ( Naomi Watts ) and Rita ( Laura Elena Harring ) . Betty is a perky blonde who 's staying in her aunt 's apartment while she audition for part in movie . She find Rita in her aunt 's apartment and decides to help her . You see , Rita 's lost her memory . She ha no clue who she is . She take her name , Rita , from a `` Gilda '' poster in the bathroom . So the two set out to discover who Rita really is . David Lynch ha been known for making some weird movie , but this film is the definition of weird . It 's bizarre , nightmarish , and absolute indescribable . It 's like a dream captured on film . By the 100-minute point , the film ha become extremely confusing - but if you 've been watching closely , it will make perfect sense . Having watched the movie and then read an article on the Internet pointing out thing in the film , I now understand the movie completely . The acting is very good . Watts is terrific . Justin Theroux is very good a a Hollywood director facing problem with the local mob . The music is excellent . Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest score . And the directing - hah ! David Lynch is a masterful a filmmaker a ever there wa . Is this your type of film ? Well , that depends . You should probably view more of Lynch 's work before watching this movie . You 'll need to be patient with the film , and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clue Lynch ha left throughout the movie . For Lynch fan , this is a dream come true . `` Mulholland Dr. '' is a masterpiece . It 's brilliant , enigmatic , and masterfully filmed . I love it .",1
"This movie start at A and never quite reach B . Its title promise far more than the film delivers . It 's superficial and filled with the usual cliche of a story in which a guy question his sexuality . The people are agreeable , even the obligatory flamboyant type . The lead ( Kevin McKidd ) overacts insofar a there 's a reason for him to act at all . Simon Callow , playing a horny straight , is always worth watching , and he 's by far the only reason to stay with the movie . However , the rubbish about his men 's group `` meditation '' or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order . They seem to have been thrown into the movie 's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non-stop inaction . The same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip . Do n't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack . Let the thing run ; you wo n't miss anything . Hugo Weaving 's character is superfluous . He appears in a sequence with one of the lesser lead and doe n't even meet the rest at all . The outcome of that sequence is n't explained , and Hugo 's real estate dealing have nothing to do with the story . The movie is a total disappointment at the end , because there is no resolution . The thing simply fade out and we 're sent to the closing credit . This is an interlude with no structure .",0

"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movie , I find this movie to be particularly grating . Maybe because I 'm from a different era and a different country , but I found Crosby 's continual reference to the Good Old USA pleasant at first , trite after a while and then finally annoying . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave , oh so smart American visitor to show them the way . It 's a `` fish out of water '' story , but unlike most movie of this sort , this time it 's the `` fish '' who ha the upper hand . To be fair to both myself and the movie , I have watched it a few time spaced over a few year and get the same impression each time . ( I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor 's Waltz - and that , too , produced the same reaction in me . And to my surprise even my wife - who for what 's it 's worth is American - found the `` in your face '' attitude of American Crosby to be irritating . One too many reference to Teddy Roosevelt , a she put it . ) As for the premise of the movie , it 's unique enough for it day and the supporting cast is of course very good . The scenery and the music is also good , a are the great costume - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix look horrid ( picture Moe of The Three Stooges ) . All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it 's pretty hard to sit through this movie .",0
"Necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic `` Moby Dick '' . John Barrymore is Captain Ahab , who fall in love with the pastor 's daughter , Joan Bennett . His brother Derek is a rival for Ms. Bennett 's affection . When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident , Bennett reject him . He must slay the whale and win Bennett back ... There are several scene which may have thrilled 1930 theater audience ; particularly the scene involving Barrymore losing his leg .

"The goofy Griswalds win the T.V . game show `` pig in a poke '' grand prize , and all fly off together to Europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another . Of all the ridiculous , unfunny money-spinning sequel this one beat the lot . Harold Ramis ' 1983 film wa a below average misadventure in which the misfit family went on a nightmarish `` Vacation '' across the States . This time Amy Heckerling ( `` Look Who 's Talking '' ) helm what turn out to be a disastrous `` comedy '' which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh . Hughes script ( with Rob Klane ) is awful and you wonder why the like of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo bothered with such a dead-beat project , a even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had the sense to decline the offer . Even an omnipotent Michael Palin is unable to lift proceeding to any level that one could call entertaining . Yet , a inconceivable a it may seem , `` European Vacation '' wa successful enough to warrant a second sequel ! Surely it could n't be a unbearable a this one . You know , I have yet to see a National Lampoon show that wa worth the bother . Monday , December 26 , 1994 - T.V .",0
"I picked this up because , having spent time in the Albany region of New York , I knew a couple of people in the movie and I happened upon it by chance . The attempt at comedy are lame , the compulsory girl-on-girl scene is sickening , the plot is nonexistent , the acting is among the worst I 've ever seen , and do n't even get me started on special effect . I realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company , but if you 're going to do a sci-fi horror flick with giant bug , do n't make the giant bug completely unbelievable . People want to see giant bug . That 's half the fun right there . And if you 're going to make the giant bug completely unbelievable , at least get the actor to make some sort of tongue-in-cheek allusion to that fact ( `` You idiot ! These are n't them ! You 've captured their stunt double ! '' ) . Be prepared to waste two hour of your life that you 'll never be able to get back .",0
"Some film manage to survive almost on originality alone - `` Wonderland '' is certainly one of those film . The script manages to throw everything into a near-fever pitch , but without making it incoherent . The speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script , but rather to accurately reflect the drug-addled reality . As director , James Cox a a very peculiar way of working his actor . Most of the character are perpetually on edge , and often because they 're rather quite ugly personality . Val Kilmer ha described John Holmes to be a hustler , able to manipulate and control . No offense to Kilmer , but his version of Holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak-minded . Nonetheless , it 's a stunning performance . Comparing this to Kilmer 's more 'Hollywood ' role like in `` The Saint '' it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flick . The actor are the main force holding all together . There are various little performance that stand out - especially the woman . Carrie Fisher , Kate Bosworth , and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterpart , but they are all fantastic . Aside from Kilmer , Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a weird , stunning energy to their role . I originally put off watching `` Wonderland '' because I assumed it wa a film about a porn actor , in the strictest sense . Yes , the story revolves around John Holmes , but it ha literally nothing to do with his professional career . Basically , this film is a murder mystery , and a such - it 's excellent . RATING : 7.5 out of 10",1
"Gunga Din ( 1939 ) is based on Rudyard Kipling 's poem.The movie is directed by George Stevens.It 's set in India during the 19th century where three British soldier have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult.Gunga Din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments.The three leading men are brilliant.Cary Grant is Sgt.Archibald Cutter , Victor McLaglen is Sgt . 'Mac ' MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. ( the son of the legendary you know who ) is Sgt.Thomas Ballantine.Let 's not forget the other fine player who include Sam Jaffe playing Gunga Din himself in a brilliant way.The beautiful and gifted Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins.It 's awfully fun to watch the difficulty of Tommy 's and Emmy 's wedding plans.Gunga Din is awfully lot of fun.It can be funny , it can be thrilling.It can be everything a good movie requires .",1
"Whatever you do , do n't stop watching when you think the movie is over ! Hang around for the first batch of credit or you 'll really miss something ! We saw this movie at the Savanaah film festival and thought it wa the best of the bunch . Dreya Weber is a marvel really , not only because of her performance , but because she can pull it off so far above the ground . At the Q & A she said there were no wire or effect , so everything you see is really her going for it . Addie could n't make it to the festival because she wa dancing with Madonna . She wa excellent and , my gawd , so beautiful . I wa amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd , but there you have it , Savannnah is n't a backwater .",1
"After reading the other tepid review and comment , I felt I had to come to bat for this movie . Roeg 's film tend to have little to do with one another , and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark . What this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith . The only other film like it-in term of it religious message-would have to be Tolkin 's ` The Rapture . ' I am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural . It is a simple movie about Catholic faith , miracle , and redemption -- though you would never guess it till the end . It is also the only movie I can think of whose resolution turn , literally , on a pun . As a ( happily ) fallen Catholic myself , I know what the movie is about , and I find a sort of fondness in it ultimate innocence about the relation between God and man . But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based , then it will go right over you head . As a film-as opposed to a story- ` Cold Heaven ' it is not ground-breaking . While ` The Rapture ' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery , ` Cold Heaven ' downplays it own cinematic quality . There are no striking shot , no edgy effect , no attempt to fit the content to the form . It is workmanlike shooting , but subdued . Nor doe it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama . It is a simple story that unfolds simply . It may seem odd ; but at the end the mystery is revealed . It look ambiguous ; but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of Catholic dogma . In this regard , ` Cold Heaven ' ha at it heart exactly the same sort of thing that drive a movie like ` The Sting , ' or ` The Sixth Sense , ' or ` Final Descent , ' or Polanski 's ` A Pure Formality . ' All of these are film with a trick up their sleeve . They may frustrate you along the way , but they have a point-an obvious one , indeed -- but the fun is , at least in part , in having been taken in . Still , even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line , it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you . Try it-especially if you are , or have ever been , a Catholic .",1
"Annie Rooney life with her officer father and brother Tim in the slum of New York , where she is constantly getting involved in many fight with the other neighborhood kid . Annie secretly ha a crush on Joe Kelly ( whose little brother Mickey is head of the gang that Annie constantly battle ) , who is in a gang that is headed for trouble , say Officer Rooney . Kelly sponsor a dance , where Tony plan to shoot Kelly in order to get even with him for making him look like a fool in front of his girl , but Officer Kelly get fatally wounded instead . Tim ( part of Kelly 's gang ) is told by Tony , and friend Spider , that Kelly shot his father , so he go after him in vengeance . Annie learns of this and go to stop her brother , if she is in time . Very good mix of humor and heart in this film , even though the plot doe n't start until the 40 minute mark of the film . Pickford is enjoyable ( even though she wa 33 playing a girl no more than 12-13 ) and really get into her character . Haines doe n't play Kelly a tough a he should , but is able make the audience feel for him on an emotional level . The scene where the officer tell Annie of her father 's death and the ending really put a lump in your throat . The mix of all sort of kid throughout the film are fun to watch . Rating , 8 .",1
"Another fantastic offering from the Monkey Island team and though it wa a long time coming and had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert it 's another worthy installment .

With title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk . Acting bad . Script bad . Director bad . Grammar bad . Movie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell . Movie make bad racial stereotype . Why come every movie with black hero have drug addict ? Why come hero always have to dance to be success ? Why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie ? Why come letter `` s '' ca n't be in title ? Hollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper English . Do self favor and not go see .,0
"Yes , 2:37 is in some way a rip off from Gus van Sants Elephant . It 's about some student who are dealing with their problem leading to the suicide of one of them . Yes , it 's full of clichés , but that 's life . You just ca n't deny that creepy nerd , disabled person or popular student who , despite their popularity , do have problem are existing in the real world . But that 's not , what this film is all about . It 's not about life in Highschool . It 's not about the misery of life itself . If you look beneath the surface , beneath the soap-like social relationship that are shown , you will find some gripping , thought-provoking criticism of our society . Why are people committing suicide ? Do we really understand their motif ? Or are we just trying to understand , after it already too late ? And why is it always someone , you would never have expected it to be ? This movie doe n't answer this question , but it raise it . And it doe so in a very intense way . All the way it keep you guessing , whose blood it might be , that you see at the very beginning . You are following the path of some student , all of them having a more or le good reason to end their life , just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale . Did you know who it would be ? Or were you caught by surprise , like in real life ? The message is verbalized by one of the surviving kid in the end . We are always so fixed on our own problem , we forget to see those of others . There might be someone , a colleague , a friend , who doe not want to live anymore . But , if you do n't open your eye , you 'll never know until it too late . This movie delivers well . It might have some flaw , but they do n't matter anymore , when it over . Either you see a reflection of society , or you are blind for reality .",1
"Motivations of the character wa completely unbelievable . Many time throughout the movie you find yourself thinking that the character ' action were totally illogical , making it impossible to identify with the character . Possibly , the writing / direction were completely out of sync making the movie painful to sit through . I wanted my money back from the video store ...",0
"I 'm a huge Steven Seagal fan . Hell , I probably weigh a much a he doe although I do n't have the street cred to sport the frizzy-mullet-ponytail . Having stated my own bias and affection for America 's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero , it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be his worst movie ever . I 'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this . In his defense the major problem with this film seem to occur in post-production . It 's painfully obvious that this movie wa supposed to have a different storyline . That result in woeful voiceovers in which Steve 's voice doe n't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice . The editing is pisspoor and overall this start bad , get even worse , and by the end you 'll wish you had rewatched The Da Vinci Code instead . Yes , it 's that bad . After this I do n't know what to expect from Steve . My friend still laugh at me for listening to his CDs . Is it time I start checking out some of the Van Damme direct to DVD nutty log ? If you are tempted to watch this movie , rip your eyeball out and flush them down the toilet . A lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minute of this .",0
"Much praise ha been lavished upon Farscape , but I do n't think it 's that good . It certainly ha a distinctive look , but it lack just about everything else : story , purpose , direction , excitement ; you name it . I 'm a big sci-fi fan , and I make it a point to watch all the sci-fi show I can . I 've almost finished the four season of Farscape , and at this point I 'm not very satisfied . The show doe have a few good thing - most notably Claudia Black ( who 's sadly missing from the first few episode of season four ) - , but they are very few and very far between . As a whole the show is marred by a lot of very silly stuff ( such a Fantasy element rather than SF ditto ) , and many many episode , esp . in season four , are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured . And one just feel that it is n't going anywhere . It 's mostly just non-directional adventure with thin , long-running plot line which develop painstakingly slowly . Well , sometimes it 's a little bit tighter , but it only last for a very few episode at a time . Effects-wise , there are a few impressive thing here and there ( esp . out in space , occasionally ) , but the show seems stuck in the same style of effect , which frankly get old fast . Outlandish and unconvincing puppet alien mar the show a great deal , and I 've come to prefer ( by far ) the episode where regular human-looking character are the focus . I think the Peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figure on the show ; they succeed in being a convincingly alien culture , despite their all-human appearance . There are a few really cool episode with them , esp . in the first season ( IIRC ) , where Crichton masquerade a a Peacekeeper captain , and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret base . Such episode can reach a rating of 8 out of 10 , but I can not award the show a a whole more than a `` 4 '' rating . Aside from the Peacekeepers ( which themselves are somewhat too single-mindedly totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced ) , the show simply doe n't offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see . OTOH , it doe contain a few good idea and is not a total loss . This is just my opinion , of course , but a a seasoned sci-fi fan , I think it count for something , and may be of help to others . There are n't a lot of good sci-fi show out there ; but Star Trek ( any series ) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape . But if you 're a huge fan of mediocre sci-fi show , you may well like Farscape , too . My rating : 4 out of 10 .",0
"I once had a conversation with my parent who told me British cinema goer in the 1940s and 50 would check to see a film 's country of origin before going to see it . It did n't matter what the plot wa or who wa in it , if it wa an American movie people would want to see it and if it wa British people would n't want to see it . This might sound like a ridiculous generalisation but after seeing THE ASTONISHED HEART I can understand why people in those day preferred American cinema to the home grown variety Back in the 1940s British equity wa devoid of working class member and it show in this movie . Everyone speaks in an English lad dee daa upper class accent that make the British Royal Family sound like working class scum and what this doe is alienate a large amount of a potential British audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people would have , If not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic term more than some high class English shrink in 1949 . That 's entertainment , the reason people go to cinema . Even the character name seem bizarre - Leonora ! How many British people were named Leonora in 1949 ? And the protagonist drink cocktail . And they use word like `` Austere `` . You do get the feeling that this wa n't marketed for a 1949 mainstream British audience . But why should it if the majority of British cinema goer were queuing up at cinema to watch far more entertaining American import ? Watching THE ATSONISHED HEART in 2005 I wa astonished how dated everything wa , in fact it 's so dated I thought maybe it might be a spoof from THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW . What did n't astonish me wa the fact that these type of movie came close to sinking the British film industry , an industry that did n't pick up until American money invested in crowd pleaser like ZULU , ALFIE and the James Bond movie",0

"I caught Evening in the cinema with a lady friend . Evening is a chick flick with no apology for being such , but I can say with some relief that it 's not so infused with estrogen that it 's painful for a red-blooded male to watch . Except for a single instance at the very end of the movie , I watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eye at any self-indulgent melodrama . Ladies , for their part , will absolutely love this movie . Ann Lord is elderly , bed-ridden and spending her last few day on Earth a comfortably a possible in her own home with her two grown daughter at her side . Discomfited by the memory of her past , Ann suddenly call out a man 's name her daughter have never heard before : Harris . While both of her daughter silently contemplate the significance of their mother 's strong urge to recall and redress her ill-fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all time , Ann lapse back in her head to the fateful day she met Harris - and in doing so , lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part way with . Both Ann and her two daughter - one married with child , one a serial `` commitophobe '' - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists , and perhaps more importantly , if true love can endure the test of time . Are we all one day fated to realize that love never last forever ? Will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome ? The subtle fact that the aged Ann is still wrestling with an answer to these question on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughter . The cinematography for Evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in Ann 's mind a she recall the past , and for that reason I think the film wa shot a if it wa all deliberately overexposed , to give everyone an ethereal glow ( and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real , but occurred in the past ) . Claire Danes is beautiful ( appearing to be really , really tall , though just 5 ' 5 '' in reality ) , and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talent are finally put to the test . You ca n't really talk trash about the cast , which lead off with Claire Danes and doe n't let up from there : Vanessa Redgrave , Patrick Wilson , Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill out the other major and minor role in the film . I ca n't really say anything negative about this film at all , though Hugh Dancy 's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss . Playing the spoiled , lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who put up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doe n't offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his order and stuck to them . In the end , gentleman , your lady friend will most certainly weep , and while you 'll likely not feel nearly a affected , the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching Evening . Catch it in theatre or grab it a a rental to trade off for point for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo flick . It 'll be your little secret that this viewing did n't really cost you much at all .",1
I never really knew who Robert Wuhl wa before seeing this . But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is . This HBO special feature him teaching `` American history '' to New York university film student and the man wa just phenomenal . He poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the U.S. but some other part of the world . This documentary/comedy wa a great satire that made me question if what I accept a the infallible true history is really true . I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting . I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his/her belief .,1
"Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians wa it nomination for original song and costume design for the Oscars . I must admit that I wa le than impressed with this film . In this sequel , Cruella DeVil ( by the way Glen Close pull off this role very well ) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour . She like all sort of animal and lock all her fur away . From that point , we only wait until she start having crisis . Soon enough , she doe and try to make the best coat of fashion world , of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur . Apart from Glen Close , I found all cast quite silly but from a child 's eye funny . That is fair enough a it target market is , I assume , child under 12 . Quite a good entertainment for child and family , but did n't do much for me . * out of * * * * *",0

"This movie is not in anyway funny , it try to be funny with it 's lame humor , which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hour of torture . Throughout the whole movie i wa thinking one thing , `` when is this gon na end '' . One thing you have to hand to them , is that they do have a very few mildly funny moment , which is also why i gave it a whole 2 star . It is unoriginal and us up almost every old blonde joke in the book , even the one that wa n't funny the first time . It basically is a movie to belittle blonde and to record the whole repetoir of blonde joke . To sum it all up , this movie is blonde humor gone bad , it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch , it is just that bad .",0
"Just Cause take some of the best part of three film , Cape Fear , A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mix it together to come up with a good thriller of a film . Sean Connery is a liberal law professor , married to a former Assistant District Attorney , Kate Capshaw and he 's a crusader against capital punishment . Blair Underwood 's grandmother Ruby Dee buttonhole Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson 's appeal . He 's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl . When Connery arrives in this rural Florida county he 's up against a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne who 's about a ruthless in his crime solving a Orson Welles wa in Touch of Evil . Later on after Connery get the verdict set aside with evidence he 's uncovered , he 's feeling pretty good about himself . At that point the film take a decided turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear . To say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly . The cast uniformly turn in some good performance . Special mention must be made of Ed Harris who play a Hannibal Lecter like serial killer on death row with Underwood . He will make your skin crawl and he start making Connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premise he 's been basing his conviction on . Many a confirmed liberal I 've known ha come out thinking quite differently once they 've become a crime victim . Of course the reverse is equally true . Many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system want to make real sure all his right are indeed guaranteed . Criminal justice is not an end , but a process and a never ending one at that for all society . I guess if Just Cause ha a moral that would probably be it .",1
"This movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is lovely . However the reason the movie is so predictable is that we 've seen it all before .

Unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea , the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized .",0

"... but I regret having seen it . Since the rating on IMDb are relatively high ( and they must also have been relatively high on Netflix ) , I guess I put it in my queue because it is advertised a a gentle comedy from the UK , a category that ha produced many film I liked immensely . `` Saving Grace , '' on the other hand , fall into the category of laugh-less comedy usually populated by Hollywood movie produced and directed by the talentless . Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress , and I have liked her in other movie . The concept -- a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she find herself confronting after her husband 's death -- doe not offend me . Notwithstanding the strenuous effort on the part of the cast to produce humor , the film fall flat on it face ( falling flat on it arse might have been funnier ) a far a I and my wife were concerned .

"This movie start off on the wrong foot and never really get it going . The first scene show a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountain in the background . For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change . The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill . To go along with that scenery , any shot outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston . The tree are all missing leaf or are pine tree , neither of which Houston ha very much of . Even the hospital itself , on the outside , is very unbelievable . Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the top hospital in the United States and sits smack dab in the middle of the Medical District just mile from downtown Houston , yet every outside shot of the hospital make it appear that the hospital is out in the suburb or even the countryside . It is obvious that whoever wa in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous shot of radar are all wrong . The first radar image in the movie is that of Hurrican Hugo hitting South Carolina . We later see Kris Kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistant tell him that Alison is moving back south across Houston yet the radar image he show ha Alison clearly moving north off of the Gulf of Mexico into Houston ... probably the initial landfall of Alison . As for the acting , it is n't all that bad . JoBeth Williams , Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a straight-to-TV movie . The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story make it a bit more entertaining . My one problem with the acting is the portrayal of Houstonians with big thick Southern accent ... the actor all sound like they are from Birmingham , Alabama and not Houston , Texas . The movie get it point across and to the general audience it doe exactly what it is meant to : entertain . If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June of 2001 then you will be disappointed . One thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on Houston metro itself . If you are looking for a factual account of Tropical Storm Alison 's impact on Houston metro might I suggest watching The Weather Channel 's Storm Stories for Tropical Storm Alison . * 1/2 out of * * * * *",0
"I heard this movie wa bad They even warned me it wa terrible , but for some reason ( probably Katie Holmes ) I still watched it when it came on national TV . Watching Kevin Williamson film mean torturing ! His scenario are n't funny , definitely not scary and not the least bit creative . Teaching Mrs. Tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere a his brainless series ` Dawson 's Creek ' and it 's probably meant for the same target group a well . Before the credit even started , 5 people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie ` I love you'-sentence . It doe n't get any better a the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop/rock and the storyline is ultra-thin . Three student on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the wickedest teacher in school . Every high-school ha a teacher like that , you know To save their skin , they try to convince Mrs. Tingle that it wa n't their intention to cheat but this attempt go horrible wrong . The typical high-school humor is completely lost on me , the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting ( with the exception of Helen Mirren ) is abominable . I 'm sure Katie Holmes can act  that 's a fact proven by her role in ` the Gift '  but she urgently need to stop accepting frumpish girl role . As said before , the only positive comment go out to the brilliant casting of Helen Mirren a the shrew . It 's like Kathleen Turner in ` Serial Mom ' ! The role suit her perfectly and you ca n't imagine anyone else playing her . Other than that , this is avoidable teenage nonsense .",0
"If you enjoy suspense this movie ha it . The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute add to her haplessness and increase the suspense . Alec Guiness 's appearance wa nice , but did n't really add to the movie . I 'm not sure if Evan Richard 's part a Andy Clarke wa an attempt to add a little humor or if he wa supposed to just be a bumbling idiot . I thought the cinematography wa excellent . This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense a well . The bathtub seen with the water droplet in slow motion wa wonderful . Also the scene where the knife come down and then it switch to Andy Clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat wa very well done . I would call it overall good entertainment",1
"Water Lilies is a well-made first film from France about young female sexuality and friendship . Sciamma work with specialized , slightly sanitized material that is a off-putting to some a it is alluring to others . The film focus exclusively on three middle-class teenage girl in a tidy new Paris suburb . Their life revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team . Such distraction a parent , sibling , work and school have been neatly excised from the equation . The central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny Marie ( Pauline Acquart ) , who is not on the team , but think she would like to be . Marie worship Floriane ( Adèle Haenel ) , an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boy are after . This take Marie away from her former best friend , also a member of the water ballet team , the somewhat plump Anne ( Louise Blachère ) . Being le special Anne is more truly accessible to the boy . Floriane , like this film , promise a bit more then she truly offer . Marie ha the more essential quality for a teenage girl : she suffers inwardly . Flroiane doe n't so much suffer a jump into situation and then bolt . Marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet a well a Floriane . Floriane take advantage of this to make Marie first her slave and a cover for her assignation , then , lacking any other friend , her confidante . All the other girl think Floriane a slut , an illusion she encourages in the men and boy she tease , because it lead them on . She suffers the pretty girl 's fate of being not a person but an object , and she ca n't resist the validation the boy give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her , but she doe n't really care about any of them and know her involvement with them are a trap . Enlisting Marie to act a her pal so her ( unseen ) mother wo n't know she 's going out to meet boy , she also get Marie to rescue her from the boy later . It looked the opposite at first , but Floriane need Marie a much a Marie think she need her . Anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that 's earthier and more real than the other girl ' . Keeping all external context at bay , Sciamma can highlight subtle shift in the delicate equation of the three girl ' goal and interaction . On the other hand the film 's water madness , which includes lot of showering and spitting a well a underwater swimming shot , make it feel completely airless at time and some of it 95 minute do not pas so quickly . Luckily the film ha a sense of humor and let the trio sometimes forget their ever-present goal and avoidance and just do silly , pointless girl thing . It 's the offbeat moment that give the film life ; too bad in a way that there are n't more of them . But Sciamma ha the courage of her obsession and what remains a one walk out of the theater is the personality and their dynamic . Along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girl , who understandably love to gaze at themselves . There 's no great revelation or drama on the way , but thing get a bit more interesting when it emerges that Marie doe n't just admire but truly desire Floriane and is jealous of her boyfriend -- whom Floriane always stop before they go all the way . In a typical irony of this kind of plot , Floriane actually decides she want to have her first real sex with Marie -- but Marie is the one who hold off , because she know it wo n't have the significance to Floriane that it will have to her . When it happens , it 's a timid , mechanical affair . Meanwhile Anne ha a huge crush on Francois ( Warren Jacquin ) , a male swimmer , but of course he is after Floriane . Boys are not an element that 's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor , but they are just body and face , available stud .",1
"If you liked Paddy Chayevsky 's `` Network '' you 'll probably like this black comedy a well , a it 's another brilliant Chayevsky script , a wonderful satire on big-city hospital and a perfect vehicle for Geo . C. Scott . He play a burned-out chief of medicine on the most chaotic day he or his hospital have ever seen . His personal crisis is coming to a head and his hospital 's falling down around him , a local resident demonstrate against the hospital and patient and doctor are dying at an alarming rate , thanks to a biblically-inspired and murderous saboteur . The latter , who theatrically declares himself the `` Fool for Christ , '' `` Parakleet of Kaborka , '' `` Wrath of the Lamb , '' and `` Angel of the Bottomless Pit , '' bop doctor on the head , administers lethal injection and swap patient ' identity , causing treatment and operation to be performed on the wrong person . This film make you uncomfortable , a deadly mistake like these do happen ( hopefully not so many , not so often and not in one place ) and at the same time make you laugh at the priceless character portrait . One is Richard Dysart ( `` L.A. Law '' ) a Dr. Wellbeck , a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends far more time worrying about his investment and publicly-traded stock than about his patient , who suffer lethally from his vast indifference and neglect . There 's Diana Rigg a free-spirited , hippie-ish Barbara Drummond , who seduces the beleaguered chief of medicine ( Scott ) and try to get him to run away with her . Then there 's the deluded murderer , who happens to be Barbara 's father and who `` function well enough '' back at the Indian reservation where he life with his daughter and even run a clinic , but who 's pushed to madness merely by being placed back in civilization . The strongest portrait by far is Scott 's Dr. Bock , who bares his soul a former boy genius , failed father and husband , brilliant doctor and responsible administrator , who constantly dream of suicide but must bear up under the demand of his job . Scott is exceptional in this demanding role . Until the final scene one doe n't know if Bock will leave the hospital behind for Barbara 's Indian reservation and a quieter , simpler life , whether her murderous father will be caught or whether the protesting , rioting local will take over and bring the hospital to it knee . Watching the crazed killer at work , one suspect Chayevsky is telling u our lunatic society make him do these thing , a we 're told he 's a different person away from city and people . As my own father wa the chief administrator of a number of large hospital over the year , I had some idea of the demand of his job and the huge responsibility he shouldered . This story make that responsibility the linchpin on which Scott 's crisis turn . This is both a funny and scary film , with the actor up to the considerable demand of Chayevsky 's script . It 's also a film I get more out of each time I watch it .",1
"In relative term having watched a lot of disgustingly bad tele Tom Fontana & Levinson are genius for creating & delivering In this writer 's book the greatest ever TV show . Oz wa treated horribly In this country , the finale went out well gone 3 In the morning , before that It wa strictly considered alternative viewing for those oblivious to prime time garbage . I first caught Oz towards the end of the first series and from then on It wa an unmissable watch . My man Adebisi possibly the most Intimidating villain ever , Beacher the perfect anti-hero , Eammon Walker 's Saeed an acting class In evocation . There wa the hardcore stuff of course - some plain evil but essentially Oz had soul . Augustus narrates the unfolding plot with pearl of Insight while the struggle of Beacher , Mcmanus , Saeed , Rebedahl etc are better than any soap opera before or since . Compassion violence wisdom tragedy Intelligence pain joy brutality love & heroism Oz went through the spectrum of human emotion - all Inside a max security prison ! I can honestly say those Thursday night with the great Vids to follow Oz series 2/3 way back In 99 were the best TV I 'll ever see . Beacher assaulting Vern In the gym Is a moment I do n't need a video for - a small screen classic I 'll never forget .

"( various spoiler follow ) Gene Kelly . Not Georges Guetary , who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un-French . Not Leslie Caron , who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance . Not even Oscar Levant , who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me . No , it would definitely be Gene Kelly . There 's something about his screen persona that 's too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing a a penniless artist in Paris , content to put off facing the critic indefinitely , frolicking with little kid and old lady and painting in the street . That 's what made him so effective in SINGIN ' IN THE RAIN and other movie where he played ambitious , focused character . Jerry Mulligan is in some way a cousin to Tommy Albright in BRIGADOON , another Lerner story with Kelly miscast a an American at loose end who fall in love with a picturesque European place and an innocent female who embodies it virtue . Except that Jerry is n't a likeable a even poor dazed Tommy . That 's another galling thing about this film . Jerry is sometimes a cad to Milo , and even worse to Lise . When he first see the latter at a club , he pull a dirty trick to get her to dance with him . When she sits down again he pull an even dirtier trick to get her phone number . When he call her the next day she hang up on him , which he take a a cue to drop in at her workplace . And throughout all this it 's obvious she want NOTHING to do with him . When she start laughing at his joke in the perfume shop , it 's about a believable a Milo 's interest in his painting . Sure he 's good-looking and playful , but why should that sway her when she 's got Henri , who seems like a gentleman to boot ? Admittedly it come off so distasteful partly because of the actress . If a role like Lise wa played by , say , Judy Garland , she would shower Jerry with indignant insult and glare . If she wa played by Cyd Charisse , one would admire his gut . But when she 's played by first-timer Leslie Caron she look and act like a shy , vulnerable teenager , and a a result Jerry just seems like a creep . And why DID they choose these other actor ( though personally I 'd rather they 'd solved thing by changing the lead ) when the whole story hinge on the romance of these two young poor sweetheart disentangling themselves from their loveless commitment to older rich people ? Not only is Gene Kelly a few year above Guetary and Foch , he 's old enough to be Caron 's father . In short I think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic-relief type dancer a Jerry , the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting role ... e.g . Ray MacDonald in GOOD NEWS or Bobby Van in SMALL TOWN GIRL . Maybe not them necessarily but someone LIKE them . Someone who could have chased Lise and made it seem harmlessly playful ; someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that Chaplinesque hole-in-the-wall ; someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with Oscar Levant 's sarcastic grumpiness . It probably also would have made the ballet seem le ponderous . And it might have provided a voice that could sing Gershwin better . All this may give the impression that I do n't like Gene Kelly . I do like him . He wa terrific in most of his film , just not this one ( well , and a few others ) . I do n't despise AAIP itself , either ; it ha good point , like the art direction . And Leslie Caron , who despite her inexperience is rather charming , and really doe look like she just stepped out of a painting . Georges Guetary doe a fine job and his `` Stairway to Paradise '' is my favorite number in the movie . Nina Foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with SOMEBODY . But not Jerry Mulligan . I would n't wish that on her .",0
"Over the year some of them most enjoyable film have been about dysfunctional family . Bonjour , Monsieur Sholmi is such a film This is an Isreali film about a Moroccan Jewish family . This could be about any family , in any culture . We all know or would want to know people like those in this comic gem . This 2003 delight wa written & directed by Shemi Zorkin . Let u hope he a long career . The movie is seen through the eye of the 16 year old son , who seems to be concerned with everyone in the family . Heis brilliantly played by Oshri Cohen ( he wa 18 when he made the movie . He ha been in a few since & I know I will hunt them up . Hopefully this young man will become an international star . The entire cast is magnificent , I do hope I see them again . I loved every person in the cast to some degree.I think all who see this will agree . It ha been nominated for many international award & ha won 8 , It deserved every one . Now being a film in a language besides English it had a very limited run in the USA , which I feel is regrettable . Rent this film you will be glad you did . Ratings : * * * 1/2 ( out of 4 ) 95 point ( out of 100 ) IMDb 9 ( out of 10 ) NOTE : Since the story is not new , this is a high a rating it can get .",1
"In 1993 , `` the visitor '' wa an enormous hit in France . So , the sequence wa inevitable and unfortunately , this sequence rank among the worst one ever made . This is a movie that doe n't keep it promise . Indeed , it 's supposed to tell a sole story . Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow it course . The problem is that Clavier feel completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century , and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard ... Instead of this , the movie go on several other story without succeeding in following the main plot . As a consequence , the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed , sometimes a bit of a mess . But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actor . Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie : they 're going over the top and become annoying . Then , why did Jean-Marie Poiré the film-maker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role ? He made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful . The other actor are n't better : Marie-Anne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau , unbearable . Of course , the movie contains a few good moment with efficient gag but it often fall into vulgarity and easiness . Certain sequence and dialog are affected . It also appears hollow because Poiré take back element that secured the success of the first movie . Thus , a young girl take Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding . A labored and disappointing follow-up . Anyway , what 's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial ?",0
"Vonnegut 's word are best experienced on paper . The tale he weave are gossemar , silken strand of word and expression that are not easily translated into a world of Marilyn Manson or Jerry Bruckheimer explosion . His word have been treated well once before , in the remarkable Slaughterhouse-5 . Mother night is probably one of the three novel Vonnegut ha written I could take to a desert island , along with Slaughterhouse-5 and Bluebeard . The film version deserves a 10 , but the book are so permanently part of my interior landscape that I just ca n't do it ... some of the scene left out of the film are part of my memory ...",1
"I watched this film sort of by accident , having bought it a the B side on The Omega Man DVD . The Omega Man wa a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning , which wa clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later , the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movie . But Soylent Green is in a whole other league . I bet this is one of Tarantino 's favourite . There are at least 3 scene in the film that I 've never seen anything like before . Heston casually getting into bed with the `` furniture '' while discussing something else completely unrelated ! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical digger ! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor . Ok maybe that 's been done since - but there are n't many film that are so consistently original like this . And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson ? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever , or what ? Luckily , I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare . Then I watched it again , and enjoyed all the little clue that make the long early scene worthwhile . A very nice script - and some great set too . Just when you thought you 'd seen everything . . .",1

"I 'm not usually given to hyperbole , but after seeing over two decade worth of Academy Awards , I can honestly say that this year 's award show wa the most disgraceful example of poor direction , total cruelty , and sheer stupidity that I 've ever had the misfortune to witness . I 'm not talking about the award themselves- a usual , there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won , who lost , and who never even got nominated , but the process is a it 's always been and is a fair a it 's liable to be . What is terribly UNfair is the treatment both the `` star '' and `` non-stars '' received at the hand of Cates and Horvitz , in the name of `` reducing boredom . '' It is bad enough that for the last several year anyone who is n't Al Pacino ha been `` played off '' at 45 second without any regard for what he wa saying , how he wa saying it , and what the emotion wa behind the statement . It demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect , however , to herd nominee on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their face while their name are read , to make them slink away quietly when they lose , to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium , and to force them to read their statement with their back to the audience . All of those thing were done to the `` non-stars '' -never mind that the movie would n't exist at all without those artist and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peer and their audience . The star did n't fare much better . It 's becoming more sad than funny when winner of the caliber of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to beg for a few extra second for their speech . Chris Rock , a host , wa neither a inflammatory and controversial a the Academy had hoped , nor nearly a funny a he could be . His opening remark were almost ( but not quite ) a offensive a Sean Penn made them out to be , and his comment during the show were more innocuous than interesting . Of course , he could hardly be blamed when it wa clear that wa being kept on a short a leash a any host ha . In the end , Chris Rock wa something he 's almost never been before : a non-entity . Even the musical number were handled poorly . Beyonce sang well , but there wa simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five song . Another example of utter disrespect for an artist wa giving Jorge Drexler 's nominated song to Antonio Banderas- even though Drexler wa present and clearly would n't have minded singing his own song , based on his winning `` speech . '' The effort of Cates and Horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree , but what resulted wa a show devoid of life . We 've all whined about the overlong speech given by people we do n't know , about the overblown production , about the self-congratulatory quality . But this is THEIR night- not ours . What is meant to be a celebration ha become an insult to the people being celebrated . Cates and Horvitz should , frankly , be ashamed .",0
"Although this ha to be the nadir of season six , this schmaltzy episode is n't badly written or acted . It 's just that most of u looked to the X-Files for taut , gripping horror/thrillers ending without easy answer and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracy . Season 6 gave u a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedy that undermined the show 's continuity and , frankly , made Simpsons ' Halloween Specials look like great thriller TV . In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL fame play the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who set himself up a a rainmaker . However her weatherman bos is the one who truly love her and Mulder wind up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town . There 's some playful fun with the chemistry between the agent and some amusing but none-too-sophisticated characterization of Midwestern hick . It 's nothing you 'd want to see more than once ! It 's hard to figure out Season 6 . X-Files creator Chris Carter seems bored by the whole 'Syndicate conspiracy ' story arc and abandon responsibility to the black comedy writer .",0

The film embodies elegant direction , moving performance and a heart- rending story . Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate a the two lover .

"This movie is proof you ca n't just go to a Redbox and read description of film and pick one and give it a try . While I 'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effect on such a low budget , and at least a halfway decent script and story line ... unfortunately , it wa only just that : halfway decent . If you like movie where thing are n't all neatly wrapped up , and do n't mind low-budget effect , you might like this film . Honestly , it wa n't really my cup of tea .

"Although normally my preference is not for romantic drama , seeing this film left me a little short . It had promise , the character and relationship could have been explored much deeper than they did , yet the story seemed not to understand the direction it wanted to take . The comparisions and parallel within the story , especially the three generation of woman in the family , had a lot of potential , but somehow did n't fully extend itself . It could have made the film much easier to relate to and attach to which is the aim of any film about lost-love and life regained . IMHO , I think the film suffered from a lack of direction in the writing , although Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock did try desperatly to breath a little life into otherwise flat character outline . It 's not that this is a bad film , some part leave you understanding the reason for various plot development , it just that this film is underdone , and a little flat overall .",0
"Silly movie is really , really funny . Yes , it 's got it dead moment , it can be a bit too obvious , it decline a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess , but it 's laugh out loud funny all the way .

The reason is because the acting is perfect , and when you see the movie , you 'll know what I 'm talking about . All I can suggest is watching it , I got so involved in it and wa extremely impressed . Estevez 's and Sheen 's relationship on the screen wa absolutely amazing . And so wa his relationship with his mother ( Kathy Bates ) . Some of the best scene include these 2 . As well a the relationship between Sheen and his daughter , Estevez 's sister in the film . 10/10 , and definitely in my top 10 . I want the DVD !",1
"There is so much that is wrong with this film , but to sum it up : Terrible acting- so bad it must have been on purpose . poor script - they may have had some good idea but this wa not the best way to present the story . ridiculously bad ending- in some case the ending manages to save the film-not in this case . if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for . This is the worst film i have seen in a long time . It wa complete torture sitting through this film , i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance . So do yourself a favor . Watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do . Even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture .",0

And on top of that , you can predict the movie 's end in the first five minute .

"This television show is stereotypical and far-fetched in many of it aspect . First of all , the setting . All of the character attend PCA , this unbelievable boarding school with painted , stylish dorm . The campus seems to have no reasonable rule - for instance , the boy are often seen in the girl ' dormitory , and vice versa . But this may be simply because the dorm adviser , a silly character that basically bore the viewer instead of amusing them , a I assume her purpose is supposed to be , sits around and doe nothing . I have friend in boarding school , and they laugh at many aspect of the school in this show . Next , the character . I wa so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon wa n't creative at all with the personality in this show . They all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme : Zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she doe ( look , grade , sport , guy , judgment , creativity , etc ) , Michael is the jock , Logan is the arrogant jerk who basically doe nothing aside from aggravate all the character a well a u poor viewer , Nicole is the preppy idiot who know nothing but somehow maintains straight-A 's , Dana wa the tough girl , Quinn is the unrealistic 'smart kid , ' whom they consistently make fun of , Chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his 'true feeling ' which really aggravates me a the show continues , and that new girl- Lola or something- is just another clone of Nicole . The main two character that aggravate me the most are Zoey and Quinn . First of all , I just do not understand Zoey 's character . She wa obviously created to be the 'perfect ' character a I said above , but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them- in most of the episode she creates a problem , then ha to fix it . What 's frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they have n't even created a very realistic character to begin with . Quinn , on the other hand , bother me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting . The impression I get from Nick concerning her character is that 'geeks ' and 'nerds ' are people to laugh at , to criticize , to mock . In the spring break episode they did a year ago , they introduced two more 'nerds ' who the character had to make 'cool . ' I found this highly offensive and stereotypical . What kind of message is Nick sending to these kid ? Is it : Do n't do well in school , do n't get good grade , do n't study hard- you 'll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series ! Because that is definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed character , and it is an awful message through and through . All I can do is hope that Nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folk in our world , they are not doing anyone any good .",0
"This movie is definitely one of the finest of it kind , . A Victrion age story of love , and , grit .

I ca n't say much more or I will spoil the experience for a new , young audience who might just be coming out . Another fine work for Sarah Waters . It also is a great way for Sally Hawkins to win over audience who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another Sarah Waters work , in `` Tipping the Velvet '' .. It is also a must see ..",1
"I found this one to be more chaotic than the average Stooges short ( a strange a that may sound ) . There were several funny bit , especially the running gag ( `` Calling Dr. Howard , Dr. Fine , Dr . Howard ! `` , the glass door breaking , the Stooges running into the supply room and coming back out with ... well , you know ) , but also quite of bit of it wa taken up with thing that just did n't make any sense to me . I have to assume that these were generally take-offs of scene from the film `` Men In White '' , but since I do n't know much about that movie I ca n't say for sure . Maybe if someone could explain these I 'd appreciate this short more .",1
"`` Scarface '' ha a major cult following even now , 22 year after it release . It ha also been widely criticized a being very tacky , unrefined , over-the-top and all bloated up ! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movie . It is true that on the technical front , ( cinematography , screenplay , direction , etc . ) Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather ' . But it is also true , that what Scarface ha and some other gangster movie lack , is the rawness , the sheer crude approach of the gangster . The Latino gangster in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangster from other gangster classic like 'The Godfather ' or 'Goodfellas ' . This is one of the major winning point of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact ha been written off a `` tackiness '' by most critic ! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface , and I must say that both these movie are way too different from each other and should be seen a two different movie instead of praising the original over the `` remake '' ! Al Pacino ha been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie . But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana 's character to be ! He is this angry young man who take hasty decision and throw fit of tantrum every other minute ! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here . He is Tony Montana , a very tacky , uneducated individual who doe n't really think much and get angry all the time ! There is definitely a very 80 feel to this movie . The soundtrack is all 80 ! I love some of the song , including 'Gina and Elvira 's theme ' , 'Push it to the limit ' and the title track instrumental . There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequence , including the famous chainsaw scene , the Rebenga hit , the first meeting with Sosa and Tony 's visit to his mother 's . About the performance : Al Pacino is brilliant a the angry Cuban refugee . He ha reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career . And it really doe seem like he ha enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scene ! One wonder what `` Scarface '' would be like without Pacino . I just could n't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probability , the film would n't be a effective without him ! Steven Bauer shine a Tony 's friend Manny . Robert Loggia is wonderful a Tony 's bos , Lopez . So is F. Murray Abraham ( a Omar ) in a small role . Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer . She look beautiful and is adequate in her role . The director doe go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax . Without revealing anything , I would only say that that wa the only little part that suffers due to improper handling . `` Scarface '' is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movie to ever come out . Enjoy it for what it is : a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland !",1
"So , this start with at least an interesting and promising basic idea , go on and on with tension , Carey in a good untypical role but in a le than you expected performance , weak direction from Joel Schumacher match with some plot hole , the `` detective scene '' show u the luck of creativity . If you do n't have great expectation ( because of the negative review ) maybe you will enjoy this . At the end they offer to u a lesson about morality ( for those who remember `` Falling Down '' ) and the `` Family Joy and Cure '' that ruin every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable P.S . It 's obvious who is the `` killer '' ! I wonder why W.Sparrow ( Carey ) did n't resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film ...",0
"while watching this movie I got sick . I have been grewing up with Pippi and every time wa a real pleasure . when my wife came to Sweden she wa looking at the oldie and had a real good laugh . but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again . it is terrible from beginning to it 's end . how can they manage to make it soo bad . well I guess someone blame the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi . may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast . burn the movie and save the kid . if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh . WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON , sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi .. Oh yes .. when read the `` spoiler '' explanation , `` 'spoiling ' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film .

"SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifter . But who is conning who here ? When doe the hunter turn into the prey ? This gritty , dark movie is slow moving and seductive . It pull you in and drag you down the proverbial garden path , only to waylay you just a you think you are safe . It ha a riveting script , with good acting ( at least from the lead ) . I did n't notice the background music , but it wa never jarring , so it must have been done right . I wa very surprised that I liked this movie , because I do n't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end .",1
"Okay , I 'll admit right up front that the Inki cartoon made by Loony Tunes are pretty offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers ha pulled them off the market . Seen today , the huge-lipped and very stereotypical Inki is not politically correct . However , the cartoon were well-made and it 's a shame they are n't released with some sort of explanatory prologue ( such a the one with Leonard Maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoon that were recently released on DVD ) . In other word , throwing out the cartoon completely is to forget our history . Plus , Inki , Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoon are out there -- especially on the internet . This Inki cartoon ha our little hero out hunting . At first , he 's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion -- a lion that is more than happy to make Inki his dinner . However , through all this , a weird Minah appears again and again ... and eventually you 'll see why this bird is so important to the story . Cute , well made and clever . I like the Inki cartoon . Plus , I take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friend just to watch them have apoplectic fit or even heart attack . Loads of fun , folk !",1
"I am a new convert you might a well say . I borrowed the dvd from my local library . I have been interested in samurai since watching 'The Last Samurai . ' My dad told me he used to watch Shintaro when he wa a kid . He said that it wa pretty good . We are up to series 3 . I absolutely love it . It take a little to get used to the dubbed English voice over the character speaking Japanese but I really enjoy it all the same . It is a little strange to watch the slight pause when the ninja star are thrown at character and they stick into a tree or wall . I wa not used to this but I am now . But I suppose that 's the technology they had in the 60 . I 've noticed that Shintaro is kind , friendly , willing to help those in need , he 's very humble , most of the time he doe n't big note himself ( he only say he is better than the enemy ninja ) . I admire Shintaro for these quality . It 's really interesting to watch the swordsmanship that Koichi Ose ha . It is amazing . This series is for anyone who are interested in samurai .",1
"This movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequence punctuated with an inevitable `` gotcha ! '' at the end of each . Really , there is no character development and no real plot to speak of . There are only the most skeletal of motivation for the character to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable doom . It 's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid ( who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm ) and his ghost mom ( with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like `` The Ring '' ) take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out , two-dimensional excuse for human character . This English-language version of `` The Grudge '' is the equivalent of cinematic junk food ; satisfying momentarily , but not really what you ought to be living on . Not recommended .",0
"If good intention were enough to produce a good film , I would have rated the turgid , ponderous , obvious `` Focus '' a bit higher than 4 . Macy doe his best , but a an earlier poster commented , Miller 's little parable asks u to suspend disbelief too often . Perhaps the novel give u a bit more background on Newman , so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitude of those around him . I agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizen were in America during this time period , then this movie might be an eye-opener . I grew up in the fifty , and the `` good '' pastor of my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach , whose sign prominently indicated that no Jews or black would be admitted . It is difficult for young people today to understand that this wa the norm , and not just in the South . As late a 1964 , when I graduated from a somewhat racially integrated ( but sexually segregated ) public high school in Baltimore , my black classmate could not attend the traditional `` father and son banquet , '' a it wa held at a facility which did not admit black . Sadly , it wa an establishment owned by a Jewish family . The subject matter of `` Focus '' is important , and we should never forget , despite the lingering sign of racism in modern America , how truly repulsive the attitude of that previous generation were . ( The `` greatest generation , '' indeed ) . So , perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forty from the like of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow . But in the end , a in `` Far From Heaven , '' the filmmaker ' good intention are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social convention of their time .",0
"I had n't heard anything about this project until I saw that it wa going to be on , so I watched it with a completely open mind . And , gee , the cast is full of strong player . Unfortunately . . . it 's awful . I do n't mean it is n't good ; I mean it 's extraordinarily bad -- sometimes laughably so , but mostly it 's just boring . Its strongest appeal come from having attractive people a naked a US network TV will allow , but it 's all tease and no substance , and having nymph a backup character ca n't justify several hour of bad TV . There are two basic problem that the cast ca n't overcome . First , the script is * awful * . Yes , making change to the Hercules myth ( which is certainly not a single monolithic story in the first place ) is traditional , but this version is relentlessly dull and much too frequently dumb ( and sometimes downright head-shakingly peculiar ) , with terrible pacing , bit borrowed from here and there ( and several part seemingly belonging in different film ) , and truly awful dialogue . The dialogue is frequently unbearably bad , in fact , to the point where you feel embarrassed for the actor . Sean Astin , apparently now typecast a second-banana , seems especially burdened by one awful line after another . There 's no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plot . Second , most of the special effect are really bad . REALLY bad . There 's occasionally a decent bit of CGI , but mostly , again , you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast . I have no idea what the budget for this project wa , but it sure look like crap compared to `` Clash of the Titans '' or even `` Hercules : The Legendary Journeys '' and doe n't even compare very favorably with the old Lou Ferrigno and Italian 'spaghetti ' Hercules movie . Just painfully miserable . There are plenty of other problem -- the story is needlessly complex and ca n't keep up with itself , and Hercules himself is n't presented a a very interesting character . Almost everyone who doe n't have a European accent try to fake one of some kind , which is not merely amateurish and dated but never really made sense in the first place : drama doe n't become better just because the actor use British accent , after all . But the terrible script and equally terrible effect sink the whole thing right off the bat . In fairness , `` Hercules '' wa apparently intended a a four-hour miniseries but truncated ( for this airing , anyway ) to a three-hour TV movie . I do n't know what they cut , but it 's possible the edits made thing worse . I do n't think you could make `` Hercules '' good by adding to it , but that doe n't mean that the continuity , say , ha n't suffered from the network edits . There 's no way I 'll watch the USA version to see , though .",0
"`` Steve '' ( Chris Hoffman ) gather a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother Wes went missing . While they are there , a reptilian creature in the shape of a man ( reminded me a lot of the Gillman from CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON ) awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one . A biker , Ellen Ripley-type time female bad-ass , Kat ( Chase Masterson ) ha an underground military bunker she practice experiment in , while it also serf a a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage . Kat know more than she 's telling ( she also suffered the loss of a child ) , but there 's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of . This creature might just be more human than they realize .. and it 's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person ha been hiding since Wes ' death . Kat hold the key to many of the mystery that unlock a the group remains near the cabin . Thankfully , a large portion of the film stay away from the creature which leap in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it 's eye . The film ha Dawson 's Creek-type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that need to build in a little monster movie . The direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scare . The cast is rather life-less and uninteresting . Pretty Maggie Grace ( THE FOG remake ) might be the only draw for this film .",0

"Mute Witness is a modest , yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comment it deserves . The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense , action-packed thriller with black comedy aspect and horror influence . No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twists just straight to the point mystery . Mute Witness handle about the vicious topic of ` snuff'-movies and is effectively set in Russia . * * * SPOILERS * * * Since the production cost are cheaper there , a US film crew temporarily move to Russia for shooting a horror film . An old hangar is used a film location . The female make-up artist of the team accidentally get locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out , she witness the recording of an authentic snuff-movie ! She 's caught and try to escape but , since she 's a mute , she ca n't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly . The girl 's life is in real danger now , since there 's a whole hidden network behind these snuff production and they do n't want the witness to be alive * * * End Spoilers * * * . Mute Witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequence and is rather bloody . Some of the mystery clue are effectively kept secret till the very end . Regarding the similar topic , I 'd say it 's definitely better than the more famous ` 8 mm ' , directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage . The acting in Mute Witness is n't great , but the leading actress ( who 's Russian herself ) look really cute . Sir Alec Guinness make a special appearance , too . And a very cool one , I may say . Surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scare .",1
"This Film wa really eye-opening . I have seen this film several time . First , when I wa four and I actually remembered it and then when I wa 12 . The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday life or just Plain going the extra mile to insult him . A great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike !",1
"It wa a painful experience , the whole story is actually there so I wo n't go into that but the acting wa horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother go to work he actually wear a white coat at home before leaving to work , I thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself look like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that ha nothing to do with the whole scene it just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his bos walk in on him and doe n't even tell him anything about it ... not to mentioned bad acting very bad ca n't get any worst than that my advice do n't watch and I thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently Uwi Boll 's movie look like classical Shakespeare compared to this !",0
"WWE ha produced some of the worst pay-per-views in it history over the past few month . Cyber Sunday , Survivor Series and December to Dismember were appalling to say the least and so it wa relying on it B brand show , Smackdown ! to attempt to end the year on a high note . Armageddon had two major gimmick match in the Last Ride and Inferno match , three Championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring Batista and John Cena against King Booker and Finlay . However , it wa an amendment to one of those Championship match that brought u not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when Teddy Long gave u fan an early Christmas present . T-Lo changed the WWE Tag Team Championship match from Champions , London and Kendrick against to Regal and Taylor to a four team Ladder match including MNM and The Hardy Boyz . I am not going to dwell on this match too much a nothing I can say would be able to do it justice . This ha to be seen to be believed . There were many high spot and many more brutal bump and awkward landing . The one move I have to talk about however wa the one that took Joey Mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest . Jeff Hardy jumped onto a ladder that wa set up in the see saw position with Matt Hardy holding both member of MNM over the opposite end of it to take the full force . Unfortunately for Mercury he did n't get his hand up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye . This wa vicious . His face wa instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended Mercury 's night early . We found out later he suffered a broken nose and cut under his left eye . Be warned . This is not for the faint of heart . The ending to this roller-coaster of a match came after Paul London managed to grab both Championship belt for the victory . I have been watching wrestling for almost 15 year and it doe n't get any better than this match . Unbelievable . The night opened with only the 4th ever Inferno match . Kane took on MVP in a good match but it wa all about the visual and not really about the action . There were a few close call with the flame for both competitor but in the end it wa Kane who forced MVP onto the flame after they both ended up outside the ring . MVP ran around the ring whilst his butt wa on fire and there wa a sick part of me that laughed watching this . May I suggest to Michael Hayes that MVP come out next week on Smackdown ! to Johnny Cash 's Ring of Fire . The other gimmick match of the night , and the second match of a triple main event wa an all out war Last Ride match between Mr Kennedy and The Undertaker . This wa a stiff match from start to finish and wa the best of the series Undertaker and Kennedy have had yet . The used pole , chair and one scene had The Undertaker thrown 15 foot from the Armageddon set onto what wa suppose to be the concrete floor . Unfortunately it wa plain to see that this wa nothing but a crash mat and crowd did n't pop for this . The ending came after a chokeslam by The Dead Man to Kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match-winning tombstone . In other notable happening from the card . Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero by submission in another stiff match . This wa a very good bout with Benoit hitting 8 German suplexes on Chavo at one time . Benoit wa also considering whether to put Vikki Guerrero in the sharpshooter or not . Luckily he came to his sens and let her go . This led to Chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission . Another cracking match on the card wa the Cruiserweight Championship contest between the longest reigning Champion in WWE , Gregory Helms and Jimmy Wang Yang . Featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spot , some of which took place outside the ring , this wa a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got . JBL put it best when he berated the fan in Richmond , Virginia for sitting on their hand during this one and at one point even started a boring chant . Helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knee to Smackdowns ! resident redneck . The Boogeyman pinned The Miz in a worthless match . I hate The Boogeyman with a passion . Only worth listening too for JBL 's ranting about Miz . JBL is comedy gold . The last match of the night wa main event number 3 . World Heavyweight Champion , Batista and WWE Champion , John Cena teamed up to take on Finlay and the Champion of Champions , King Booker . There wa no way the match could top the Tag Team Championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the le . The match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minute but how many time have I said that about WWE match this year already . It wa King Booker who wa pinned at the end of the match after a big Batistabomb . So 2006 is over for the WWE in regard to it 's pay-per-view schedule . It started the year on a terrible note with New Year 's Revolution but ended on a high one with Armageddon . This Ladder match will long be remembered a one of the greatest ladder match of all time . My hat is off to all eight competitor who but their body on the line to give the fan one hell of a match .",1
"The time I wasted seeing this movie , I demand back ! I felt sick afterward , but not because it touched me in any way . It 's pretentious , trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved , but I could n't care le . The character are soulless and stupid . You do n't get an explanation for some of the scene and it doe n't leave any thought afterward to come up with your own explanation . All of the student in the movie ha issue , but since you do n't feel for them you do n't believe their problem . If I could write better in English I 'd never stop . But I ca n't , so , I 'll stop now . Do n't watch this .",0
"Like others , I have seen and studied most of the book and film concerning the Clutter Killings , including a few dramatic work thematically based on the action and psycho-mythology of the participant to the crime -- including Capote himself . As to Capote , I can not forgive him for willfully withholding Perry Smith 's confession , intimacy and writing from even the defense counsel . I believe truth and fact Capote `` reserved '' for his `` book , '' which required for Capote two guilty verdict and capital punishment , would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for Perry Smith even under the old McNaughton Rule . Capote himself could never write another major literary work after `` In Cold Blood . '' Shame and guilt . In my opinion , he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book/drama . To him , both men HAD to die for his book to succeed . The book had to justify itself by pretending it wa about the horror of capital punishment . His action and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion . Capote 's book is not truth . It is not factual or journalistic . It is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination . What most people consider the virtue of the contemporaneous first movie are stark image of Capote 's mind , which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all . No wonder viewer ironically but necessarily prefer Blake 's performance . That actor IS the nightmare from Capote 's dishonest imaginings . So who is to say how the two killer should be played ? Who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to `` do it now '' killing ? I agree with the few who see in Eric Roberts ' work a magnificent performance , Shakespearean in it range , yet played with heartbreaking sincerity . Anthony Edwards take a much safer `` attitude mode '' to create a smarmy Hickok ; but he is one-dimensional and boring , with only a few note in his television range . Roberts is almost four-dimensional , adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body , a Frankenstein Creature who think in poetry and know exactly what NOT to do . Like Leopold apropos Loeb , Robert 's Perry Smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man . Without Hickok or a man of his particularity , Perry Smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horror . He fear himself more than he fear anything else in life . Given the freedom from Capote 's death grip on the consciousness of the Clutter killing , Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personality and psychosis to craft a different and new production of the drama . Same fact , some of the same line from the case record , but deeper , more complex , with clearly titanic psychotic stress -- indeed Roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he ha of where or who he is . What many of our reviewer dislike about this film , Roberts in particular , is that cold-blooded killing is n't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand . That is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic `` interpretation of life and death '' than Capote could ever create -- a real Tragedy . The actual cold-blooded killer , Mr. Capote , and his hypocritically artistic `` non-fiction novel '' do not control these interpretation and performance . If `` In Cold Blood '' and Capote 's effect on life , literature and truth matter a much a scholar say , then it take gut a well a talent to portray the truth , or a version of the truth , that is not the rank , cowardly lie drawn up from the fathom of Capote 's own abyss .",1
"`` Fungicide '' is quite possibly the most incompetent , embarrassing , pitiful `` film '' I have ever seen . The acting is criminal , the direction practically non-existent , and the special effect presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulty on a defenceless laptop computer . Far be it from me to stifle creativity , but I actually believe thing like this should n't be made . I am sure the `` film '' -makers will say that , yes , the `` film '' wa hampered by a low ( a in nothing ) budget - but in that case they just really should n't have bothered . As it is , they have offered the world something so dire , so execrable , that only imbecile could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it . Starting the `` movie '' it wa n't a though I wa expecting `` Citizen Kane '' or anything . I wa expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness , a hint of fun , and even some energy . What I got wa the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief . The plot ? Well , our leering antihero scientist , who work in his parent ' basement , is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup . Apparently , such high-level science is the end-result of year of research . His parent then send him off to a strange hotel-type place in the countryside to relax . There are some other people there , who are simply too awful to write about . Anyway , the scientist drop his test-tube onto some mushroom - and soon the mushroom grow and kill some people . ( Wow , I 'm getting suicidal just writing the plot summary ) . Our hero save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar ( by attaching a `` fuse '' - really a piece of string - to it ) . The barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon , destroying all the mushroom . The end . ( Thank goodness ) . That summary is a good a the `` film '' get ( and actually make it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is ) . It really should never have got past this stage of development ( by which I mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayon ) . Somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said `` NO . '' And those `` special '' effect . Well , they 're `` special '' all right . This is CGI gone crazy . And done by a person who I can only assume belief the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology . And when the mushroom monster are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphic package , they are represented by actor shuffling along covered in a sheet ( I kid you not ) . One of the most inexcusable thing about the movie is it laziness . This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spin his gun ( a la Clint Eastwood ) and then fails miserably to get them in his pocket . I mean come on , a couple of retake and he could have pulled it off , but just to leave it a it is - really weak . I can not believe money wa spent on this camcorder-shot rubbish . The `` film '' -makers should hang their head in shame and be banned from going within fifty metre of any movie-making equipment . I also think it 's wrong that friend and family of the maker come onto IMDb and post mendacious review and give stupidly high user rating which give a totally inaccurate picture of the `` movie . '' `` Fungicide '' is an absolute travesty of film-making . Mr Wascavage is either very , very stupid or very , very cynical .",0
"`` Her Cardboard Lover '' is Norma Shearer 's last movie . She quit the movie and , I think , joined the Board of Directors at MGM . That wa a good move on her part . `` Her Cardboard Lover '' wa talky and boring in part . It wa obvious there were only a handful of actor with speaking part so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat . The story wa a good idea about a wealthy woman ( Norma Shearer ) hiring a man ( Robert Taylor ) to make her playboy fiancee ( George Sanders ) jealous . I am surprised that the director , George Cukor , did not cut many of the talky scene between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor . Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in `` The Women '' but not in this movie . The best performance in the movie wa given by Robert Taylor . During Mr. Taylor 's career , he wa given his best comedy role in this movie and `` When Ladies Meet '' in 1941 . In 1942 , he gave his best comedy performance in `` Her Cardboard Lover '' and , up to then , his best dramatic performance in `` Johnny Eager . '' He had a busy year . I think of all the actor at MGM , Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actress on the lot . Also , MGM gave Mr. Taylor all type of movie to make - most of them were successful . That is why MGM kept him for 25 year . Mr. George Sanders wa very good a a socialite heel . He played a similar role eight year later in `` All About Eve '' for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role . As for Ms. Shearer , this wa one of her worst performance , she wa not funny and too dramatic for this comedy . It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 , `` The Women '' , and gave her best performance . It wa obvious that she wa too old looking for her younger leading men in `` Her Cardboard Lover . '' Also , it did n't help that some of her clothes were awful . Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together , the superb `` Escape '' . The same comment about this movie can be said of another movie , `` Personal Property '' that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow . It wa too talky , boring , and the actress looked old . Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor , so in 1937 , she died at age 26 . What a waste ! She wa becoming a good actress and getting better role .",0
"Uzumaki , which translates into `` spiral '' , arriving within this new wave of Asian Horror film following such hit like Ringu , Ju-On and The Eye ( two of them with remake .. and much more coming like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters ) , fall short of the spooky , supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other movie , the only thing that remains is weirdness and not in a Tim Burton or David Lynch kind of way , but in a irrelevant and dull way . Its start with a girl , some other kid with a crush on her , her best friend and his dad who 's obsessed with Uzumakis ! Everything that happens concern Uzumakis , people die and you see Uzumakis . So okay , It 'll go along with it , I 'm kinda amuse by spiral myself , character do n't seem to go anywhere , but I 'll play along . We find out the town is cursed by Uzumakis , people start screaming at Uzumakis and the point is Uzumakis are everywhere , the movie is a disaster , it doe n't know where to go , except to show you the power of Uzumakis ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! There are some cool concept like when the mother cut her finger because she see Uzumakis on her fingerprint but then there 's another scene where she hears her husband ( from beyond the grave ! ! ) tell her that she also ha Uzumakis in her ear , the way they handled that scene wa just laughable , not even cheesy fun , there are also some ( a little bit ) of cool visuals , like the collection the father ha of Uzumakis and the girl with the Uzumakis hair .. yep , Uzumakis hair , it out of context though , it seems like it wa taken out of a Fruit Snack commercial where if you eat an Uzumakis fruit snack , it taste is so incredible your hair turn into Uzumakis , now if this wa n't bad enough , suddenly , out of nowhere there are Snail Men .. or ManSnails whatever and you know why ? right ? Because in their shell they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis . That only left time enough for a crappy anti-climatic ending and by that time I wa sick of friggin ' uzumakis .. uzumaki here uzumaki there , sure , look around you , how many Uzumakis can you find If you want to see a movie about spiral go see PI ( 3.1416 ) now there you 'll find some pretty cool uzumaki concept in between the meaning of life and Dark City ha also a little bit of a spiraling thing in there . This movie could have worked a a music video , it ha already garnered a cult following and thats why I wa compelled to see it , but after doing so , I 'm not sure why people think it 's great . I wa truly disappointed .",0
"Bog Creatures show exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash , some knowledge of movie making , a mixed bag of aspiring actor , and a lot of determination , yet all without the necessary knowledge and skill to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking After School Special ( in a bad way , not a nostalgic good way ) . I mean this is so-so quality home movie / student film stuff if you want to pas it around to family and friend for free . Thankfully , I found it in a discount bin somewhere . Sure , there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing , but it is a market that seems to only exist by default because there are so many poor B movie out there . Even more so now in this day and age . The only people I would recommend this move to is aspiring guerrilla filmmaker . First , I would recommend that they watch the special feature MAKING OF thing included on the disc . See the film crew enthusiasm , their hard work , joy , and very high opinion of their own product . THEN watch the movie . Within a few frame you will hopefully understand what went wrong . Bored , I went through the whole thing and clearly the director and cinematographer tried , but just do n't know enough about what they are doing . They knew enough to have fun , but in the long run , without necessary skill , this interprets to : They knew enough to be dangerous . This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie ( a apposed to a more decent one I guess ) . A couple of the actor did ok , and the cool stoner looking dude with the tattoo ( real or fake tattoo I know not ) wa probably the best and most natural and I hope he make it . But their natural acting talent wa what wa coming through despite the bad movie , bad script , and so-so directing principle . If the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actor to develop their character , studying successfully proven camera technique and lighting principle to direct his crew better , and if the script had been actually worked on instead of written in a week or so ( according to the very indulgent documentary ) then maybe this could have been more of a film . Instead , it 's a film that ha a feeling of some potential , and ha a few moment in it ( due more to the genre than the film itself ) , but end up showing nearly every frame , WHAT NOT TO DO . If you want to see what a decent low budget horror movie can really look like , watch Phantasm or even Laserblast . If you want a glorified home movie ( no joke ) , get Bog Creatures .",0
"Having listened to and enjoyed Harvey Bernhard 's Omen II commentary I wa shocked to discover he wa also behind this absolute piece of rubbish . It 's like a really bad TV movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote . I think at the bit where Michael Lerner is confronted by what I can only describe a a high school cast of Les Miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief . And then my mouth wa going up and down because I wa laughing so much . Dire . I do n't know why I have to write a minimum of ten line , I have made my point succinctly , there 's nothing clever about all this modern verbiage .",0
"Tim Taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict . He 's a coward and a child and ha absolutely no redeeming quality a an actor or a person . The only film with him in it that is enjoyable is `` Galaxy Quest '' and that just because his character - a boozed out washed up actor from a former hit TV show - wa so close to real life for him . The rest of the cast is equally bad . I HATE the mother and the actress that played her Patricia Richardson , she suck ! Ever cliché is there , the stupid woman who is fat and like opera and only care about her child , while in real life she 's proclaims family value and get divorced after having twin . And the child actor were about a interesting a a root canal .",0
"I have to admit that Holly wa not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival . However , after the Artistic Director of the Festival specifically recommended this film to an audience of over 200 people prior to the screening of another film , I decided to go to see it . Wow ! This film is dealing with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and doe so without any compromise . I have found myself cry a number of time during the movie and laughing at others . Speaking about an emotional roller coaster . The lead actor ( Thuy Nguyen ) is a Vietnamese newcomer ( who wa only 14 at the time of filming ) and had to tackle this incredibly complex and difficult role . She reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes from Whale Rider but the role here is much more demanding a she ha to play a child prostitute . Chances are that she will win numerous award . The main story is about a girl who wa sold to prostitution by her family and held a a sex-slave in a brothel in Cambodia . She meet an American ( played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role that we are not used to see from him ) , who after spending some time with her decides to help her . By that time however , she is sold again and he is going on a search for her around Cambodia . The story turn and twist and the audience can never predict what will happen next . The acting wa strong across the board with a very interesting international cast . Udo Kier ( very convincing a a sex tourist ) , Virgine Ledoyen ( touching a a social worker ) and Chris Penn ( one of his last movie ) . The Asian cast wa also superb . Although the film deal with this difficult subject matter it focus successfully on telling a compelling , powerful story . It wa shot in Cambodia ( some scene in real operating brothel ) which add to the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary . It seems that the DP used a lot of hand held camera and close-ups and overall it made you feel like you are right there a part of the story . After the screening , I wa listening to other member of the audience a they left and it seemed that they were all stunned . This is not an easy film to watch and I salute the filmmaker for not making a `` Hollywood Film . '' It is by far the best film I have seen in the Edinburgh Film Festival . Opinion shared by my husband and a couple of other friend .",1
"My one line summary should explain it all , but I 'll have a go at it . From the get-go , this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera , and that 's about all I can comment on . There were a few interesting scene , such a the `` Big one '' that hit during the middle of the movie , but , wait , what 's that ? The earthquake * gasp * , wait a minute ! That 's Dante 's Peak ! Well , part of it butchered and slapped in . I ca n't believe how poorly this movie wa done , `` borrowing '' scene from other , much better film . One wonder what director thought that viewer are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrop exist in downtown LA , ala Dante 's Peak . My advise , forget the Bond Wanna-be , Nash , in this film and go for the real thing ( again , someone from Dante 's Peak coincidentally . )",0
"Okay okay , I must admit , I do somewhat like Peter Liapis and I 'll admit this is not the best Ghoulies sequel . I mean , yeah , it had it flaw , such a NO GHOULIES themselves . But the two Ghoulies that come to earth were really funny , I guess they were called , Dark and Lite . I enjoyed the plot of the movie . And even at the end of the movie both Ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel . Still waiting . lol . Peter Liapis reprised his role a Jonathan Graves , this time playing a detective , how cute ! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or suspenseful , but it is definitely funny . I thought I would comment on this movie and just say -- it 's not that bad . It is worth watching even though the Ghoulies are n't in it .",1
"I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola 's masterpiece . I wa lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 , a he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert . He wa very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art , especially his portrayal of the young Captain . This is , without a doubt , a must see , a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History . `` Charlie Do n't Surf '' . Robert Duvall 's famous line ( the other one ) doe not need repeating a it ha become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered a a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition . It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne look .",1
"I sat down to watch this movie with my friend with very low expectation . My expectation were no where near low enough . I honestly could not tell what genre this movie wa from watching it , and if it wa a comedy , the humor wa completely missed . The plot wa nonexistent and the acting wa horrendous . My friend and I managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minute of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back . I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movie of all time . I honestly do n't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatre and moreover I can not understand why anyone would willing watch it , considering not only it 's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors/actresses in it 's cast . This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made . It 's certainly the worst movie I 've ever had to sit through .",0
"I do n't think this movie wa rated correctly . I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 , whatever the R limit is . Why ? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian woman . I do n't know about you , but that 's not something for little child to be watching . True , it might be the traditional `` clothing style '' of the African ( ? ) Indians , but ... I think partial nudity should give a movie an R rating . I have n't seen the movie recently , but I guess otherwise , it wa alright .",0
This film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a Hollywood production.Poor story outline ( stupid robot story ) ... ultra bad acting by untalented pop idol ... and they are trying to '' FIGHT '' ! ! ! My goodness ... those miserable actor us wire to make them look like they are `` good fighter '' ... : ( and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I have ever seen ! ! ! I will never touch his movie again.AVOID this movie at all cost ! ! ! I wanted to give it a negative value out of ten ... not even worth a 0/10 .,0
"I 'm a Geena Davis fan for life because of this movie . I 've always loved Samuel L Jackson . And the two make a great pair on screen . This said , I think 'TLKG ' is the best action movie I 've ever seen , forget the twist ending that audience have now come to expect and that filmmaker now try ( mostly failing ) to incorporate into their movie . 10/10",1
"A great 90 's flick ! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash . Posey give an amazing performance a a librarian and a night crawler . This is a good , light movie for Saturday night before you go out . The soundtrack rock , the outfit are out of this world , the script is funny and the actor do a great job . The redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try , just find your niche . I believe Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this kind of character : young , fabulous and broke . ( You must look up the movie `` Clockwatchers '' ) . If you watch Party Girl you are bound to have a good time . Enjoy !",1
"This fantasy wa utter garbage . I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movie , but this one wa far worse than anything he ever did . No wonder critic of the British medium complain it 's driven by tabloid journalism . This movie is a left-wing loony 's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen . Anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid Bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made . I 'm sure it will do well in Syria , Iran , Pakistan , and North Korea , though . It 's hard to believe that in these day of insane Muslims blowing up innocent commuter there is anyone in the U.K. who think Britain should surrender in the war on terrorism . I guess it 's no longer the country I admired for standing alone against the Nazis nearly 70 year ago . All hail Neville Chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement !",0
"Satan 's Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movie I have seen . When I say better I mean the story . The film hatch a new plot , something that 's not so cliché in the Horror genre - something fresh . But there are also some ridiculous question that come along with it . Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie . The film first caught my attention while I wa cruising the Horror section in HMV . I wa tired of all the so called `` terrifiying '' Hollywood blockbuster and wanted something different . The cover art for Satan 's Little Helper immediately caught my attention . As you can see , the image draw you in - it 's chilling ! I knew it wa a straight to DVD release - but I took a chance . I mean , I just seen `` Boogey Man '' the night before - so It could n't get any worse ! After I watched the movie , I wa semi-satisfied . I loved the plot of the movie . It wa really creepy how the killer wa pretending to be the little boy friend , so he could kill . In some sick deranged way , he actually thought he and the little boy would become partner - a duo of terror . It wa a great idea to set the film on Halloween night . This way , no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid . They would simply think he wa his guardian . But , this is also where the `` plot hole '' begin to surface . If your son came home with a `` friend '' he met trick or treating - that 's fine . You would n't think anything of it - if he wa 9 ! , or round about the same age a him . If however , he appeared with a strange man in a mask , you would be startled and protective of your child . You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself . You would ask why he is with your son . He doe n't know him . You would tell him to please leave . He is n't a family friend . He 's a stranger . Now , we 're supposed to teach our child not to talk to stranger . In this case , the mum is completely fine with it . Huh ? They never seem to think it 's a tad odd that the `` man '' doe n't speak - at all . Gruanted they think it 's the daughter boyfriend , but after 10 minute of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he 's not saying a word . The film go down hill from there . The thing that got me the most wa , all the mum said wa `` Do you want some cider ? '' . I ca n't count how many time she say this in the movie . It 's like , oh you 're dying - we have cider though , it 's all good ! ! The movie started promising , and failed to deliver . It wa more of a horror/comedy , and even a that it fails to deliver . I guess you could call it a `` Dud '' , '' Flop '' etc .. The best thing about the movie is the cover art . Though , something tell me that 's not worth the 12 dollar !",0
"Cartoon-like special effect , horrible acting and dialogue , and dry plot ! This movie ha it all ! My friend and I went to blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of , but this wa just too much . The movie begin with a woman and her son vacationing on a made-up island in the Bahama region . The woman , who just happens to be a doctor/virologist is in the area when a man collapse . He ha a strange wound on his arm , and she immediately know that it is a contagious virus . The story go on to show startlingly fast romance between the two teenage lead ( this is justified by the girl saying `` I know it 's fast , but it just feel nice . '' ? ? ? ? ) Anyway the entire island get infected with this virus and the CDC is brought in . We are told that within three month , if the virus is not treated and contained that it will spread to the united state and kill million of people . This information doe not stop the CDC from leaving the island to save themselves . Thankfully the cure to this horrible virus is found just in time , and the entire island is saved . To celebrate the death of there loved one , the island people have a smashing party where everyone is dancing , having fun , and forgetting about the horrible epidemic that just occurred .",0
"Much about this movie wa beautiful . The acting , the scenery , and without a doubt , Aaron 's cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shot . Definitely worth watching , a your attention will be captivated the entire time , and it end on just the right note . The acting by newcomer Jonathan Furr wa superb , a one would think he wa a pro acting since he wa born . He ha gone on to act in other feature film , but this starring role will always be remembered . The film doe have that academy award feel to it at time , where it 's slow and scenic and quiet , so it 's not a movie that a.d.d . kid can sit through . However , the rustic feel of East Bend and Yadkinville played out well a a 1940 's era film .",1
"I will admit I did n't pay full attention to everything going on in this film , but to be honest , I do n't think it would have mattered . Basically local councillor Sidney Fiddler ( Sid James ) persuades the incompetent Mayor Frederick Bumble ( Kenneth Connor ) of Firecombe to hold a beauty contest , to improve the town 's image . They face opposition from woman 's liberationist Augusta Prodworthy ( June Whitfield ) trying to sabotage the contest , but they do have publicity agent Peter Potter ( Bernard Bresslaw ) and Palace Hotel owner Connie Philpotts ( Joan Sims ) . Soon enough the young , beautiful wannabe model show up , including Hope Springs ( Barbara Windsor ) , Paula Perkins ( Valerie Leon ) , Dawn Brakes ( Goldfinger 's Margaret Nolan ) , Debra ( Sally Geeson ) and Ida Downs ( EastEnders ' Wendy Richard ) . When the girl have cat fight , it doe draw away regular resident , but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendo and William ( Jack Douglas ) having over-active twitch , it doe finally reach the competition , and it 's just afterwards I could n't be bothered . Also starring Patsy Rowlands a Mildred Bumble , Peter Butterworth a Admiral , Joan Hickson a Mrs. Dukes , David Lodge a Police inspector , Angela Grant a Miss Bangor , Arnold Ridley a Councillor Pratt , Robin Askwith a Larry , Patricia Franklin a Rosemary , Jimmy Logan a Cecil Gaybody and Dad 's Army 's Bill Pertwee a Fire brigade chief , Charles Hawtrey had obviously quit the Carry Ons , but where 's Kenneth Williams ? I suppose seeing Babs and young , beautiful looking Pauline Fowler in bikini , but for comedy value , this fails miserably , and the overuse of the swanny whistle just get on your nerve . Pretty poor !",0
"From all the bad comment about this movie and add them up I feel the same way . It may look like the Australians are weakling instead they were brave soldier . In this film it wa very terrible and too graphic . I did n't see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because it nothing from what I read . We do n't need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through . It 's like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier . For example Mel Gibson is a over extreme director for his movie not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy . Letters of Iwo Jima wa one of the war film that wa close enough to history ( although I could be wrong ) except Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai . You 're better off reading it it an insult to the victim and the fallen if you do n't tell it right , and the movie drag on for too long there wa nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussie to kill Japanese soldier . Just read history on the internet , mag and in book . Movies always kill the sense of realization . What they did to POWs in Singapore and the Philippines wa just dreadful escpically to civilian . It just make me feel proud to see goody beat the baddie but movie like this ruin it .",0
"Eh . This is a popcorn movie , nothing more . I watched this with a bunch of friend ( and though that might NOT be the best way to view a horror movie ... ) and most of the dialogue and action wa laughable . It left me yearning for a real film . : ) The main problem is the lack of tension in the film . It keep flashing back to 'explanation ' scene , which dissipates any discernible tension . And the character relationship 'twists ' ? Yeah , they suck . I wo n't say what they are , but they just do n't add anything to the film/storyline . ( By relationship , I mean the two main character . ) Eek . My recommendation is this : watch this movie if you ca n't think of anything better . Mediocre at best ... Maybe not even that .",0
"To say I wa disappointed is an understatement . An amateur film made by professional . I wa about to leave the theater in two or three occasion ( something I 've never done ) I wa stopped by Cloris Leachman really . She ring true , the only one I should say . This new woman are le modern than the George Cukor woman of the 30 's . This one are `` acting '' for u trying to be with it but their `` conflict '' is exactly the same a it ha always been , in movie anyway . The fun of the original wa based on a crisp , vitriolic and very funny script . A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast . All the element that are missing here . TV actress mingling with model and Oscar nominees/winners . There wa n't anything organic about it . The whole thing felt like a put on , improvised in the moment without a clear objective . 2/10",0
This picture for me score very highly a it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of Alien Invaders taking over a town and many of it ' men folk . The town and the player are all decked out in sort of 1950 's style and the whole movie ha a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it . Some of the scene are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature . All the actor give full blooded and serious performance which make the film even funnier and the special effect and Aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd rate to add to the amusement . These type of film often deserve a cult following : 8/10 .,1
"What I hoped for ( or even expected ) wa the well known `` stop motion '' imagery and extreme slow motion , extreme zoom and all embracing fish eye take . In short : The art of a ) finding interesting Visual Events and b ) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of , to be replayed so that the human eye can see . The stuff that made the other Qatsi 's hit . I just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title . Having watched the movie I got the feeling that the focus in this third part wa on the message and not on the wrapping . That 's fine , especially since the message is so valid . But I already knew the message , and it appeared there wa nothing else left for me . More then half the film wa solarized or colorized or posterized or transformed through some other filter . It looked a lot like the effect your video camera doe but you never use . A lot of the image would have been prettier without the filter , like the giraffe and zebra chase . You could say that 'technology or whatever human based malicious source disfigured our beautiful nature ' but why use these seventy effect to symbolize that ? At the point that there had been more than 10 minute in a row of this cheap looking effect I wa ready to leave . The hope that the rest just could n't BE that bad made me stay . But then there wa the slow motion : slow motion is good because it give you time to analyze the moving picture . But if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frame a second , then there 's just not enough motion to slow down . Please , record the motion-to-be-slowed faster , like wa done with the beautiful shot of the foaming and splashing water ( some of ) the laughing people and the drill song singing soldier . I acknowledge that archive picture ca n't be redone , but I had already seen a lot of that footage anyway , it could have done without it . It must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage , and the effect ca n't have been that easy to apply and arrange a well . On top of that , a lot of the work wa mixed with each other . It show that the creator wa n't out to lengthen the movie or to spare himself . But I did n't like the mixed stuff one bit ... The idea behind it wa sometimes nice or even clever , but the implementation wa insufficient . The computer generated image did n't bother me that much , however out of date . The 'bits ' streaming along circuit ( in the first part of the film ) looked more recent and were nice . Mandelbrot is always fun , the fractal-mountain wa le . I wa pleased to hear a cello playing a major role in the music . A little le vibrato at certain moment would have been appropriate with Glass ' music , but that 's a matter of taste . As is all of the above , of course . I do hope that there will be another Qatsi story to tell soon , where computer imagery will have a le significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again .",0
The turgid pace of this movie numbs u to any shock that it might provide . There wa no real suspense . Most of the character were insipid . The chesty Irish priest wa a lame a the love interest . Interest is misleading . The girl that they chose to provide the film 's sensuality might be better . The central conflict of the main character wa uninvolving . This film is entirely devoid of positive . It is like a tedious exercise by someone who did n't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway .,0
"Not the best of the Lone Star series , but it move along quickly with good performance . Introduced a `` Singin ' Sandy '' in the main title , John Wayne a a 'singing cowboy ' is n't successful -- you never even see a front close-up of him while he 's 'singing . ' The actual singer is the director 's son , Bill Bradley , who warble away sounding like many popular singer of the day such a Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff . The film feature : Cecilia Parker ( also seen in `` The Lost Jungle '' serial , `` Tombstone Canyon , '' and a older sister Marian in the Andy Hardy movie ) doing her best Katherine Hepburn -- `` Really they must n't ; really I 'm not '' ; Al St. John , before he literally became `` Fuzzy '' filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping , head and chin scratching , grimacing , and gawky physical gesture and movement ; George ( pre-Gabby ) Hayes a a gentle pipe smoking father ; and Forrest Taylor , minor vet of 395 movie and TV show , playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar . Fun or odd moment : Yakima Canutt 's great 'under the stagecoach ' trick ; the 'gay ' scene when Singin ' Sandy tie Bert and Elmer together face to face , drag them roped to his horse , and dump them at Kincaid 's office , where Kincaid say , `` You 're a fine pair of lovebird ! `` ; Denton 's rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by 'Sandy , ' -- `` Ummm . I could listen to that all night ! `` ; Kincaid 's reply , We wo n't go into that , '' after being told by a rancher `` You 've got the soul of a snake ! `` ; and , of course , he utters the immortal , `` I 've made Denton an offer he ca n't refuse . '' The plot of the movie is saved by Sandy 's tricking Kincaid , and later saying the three magic word in many of these film : `` I 'm from Washington . '' FDR ha saved u from the Depression ! ( Is that why the villain are always either banker or in real estate ? ) The shootout sequence is taken from the earlier Bradbury film `` Man from Hell 's Edges '' ( 1932 ) . All of the Lone Star western are special because of their unique mixture of interesting character , the troupe of actor and stunt people , and the spin on the clichés and repetitive back story and situation . This one rank a little low , marred by the inappropriate and mis-used `` Singing Cowboy '' gimmick . I 'll give it a 4 .",0
"I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me , and we both had the same feeling about it : it wa n't terribly motivating , and did n't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like , so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one . In fact there wa almost zero technical information at all . I did n't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video , but when that info wa near zero then the film just wa n't balanced , and wa n't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run . There were other problem . Some of the very first image were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race . Yeah , real inspiring . The timing wa also hard to follow , because it wa semi chronological , but the filmmaker rarely gave you any good clue a to what point in time you were looking at . And they withheld information . You see that Kantor ha an injury , and you just assume it 's from all her training , but then several scene later they finally clue you in that it 's because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard . Some part were very good , though , like the bit about a woman defying race official who wanted the run to be men-only , and the coverage of a Chicago race where two of the runner portrayed earlier were vying for first place . Off the top of my head , I 'm thinking of other chronological documentary , like Supersize Me , and Grass , where you always know where you are , and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know . In short , it would n't have been hard to make a better marathon film , and a it stand I ca n't recommend this to non-marathoners to educate and motivate them to try one , because I do n't think it will have that effect .",0
"`` The Love Letter '' is a somewhat pleasant , very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few word in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passion and longing of a sleepy sea-side town 's inhabitant . It 's not for all audience . `` The Love Letter '' , I feel , benefit from it 's simple and quiet tone . Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedy it 's quaint , picturesque , and comfy . However , for these exact same reason , many viewer will be bored and disinterested . The cast is nice . It 's great to see Tom Selleck again , and is such an underplayed role . And it 's hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 year ago in `` Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom '' . She 's quite naturally good here ; improving in every role I 've seen her in since grating on Indy 's nerve . And is it possible Capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age ? ( What is it about that Spielberg ! ? ) It doe n't amount to much ; but after another noisy summer movie season I 'll probably look back with brief fondness for this light-as-a-feather romance .",1
"My wife and I just finished watching Bûsu AKA The Booth . She fell asleep during some part of the movie . I really wish I had taken a snooze with her , but the unfortunate fact is that the main character 's voice is so loud and grating that it wa impossible for me to sleep . When our protagonist speaks , it make me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke . He also ha no redeeming quality . I wa hoping he 'd get hit by a bus five minute into the film . Do n't get me wrong , I love Asian horror cinema , but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scene that really make no damned sense at all . If you want some good Asian cinema , check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror . Avoid The Booth like the plague , especially if you suffer from frequent migraine .",0
"May be spoiler so do not read if you do not want to Just like watching the TV news , everything is already happened , a great tsunami loom over a city bay and CUT , no more to see , Tokay suffers a large earthquake , did anyone see more than the 5 second I saw ? If you want to make a love story , make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title , do please be kind enough to show me THE DISASTER , pd after watching this movie watch JISHIN RETTO or any GODZILLA film to satisfy the part that wa willing to see people screaming and building collapsing that did not get a chance to do in this movie . Don t take me wrong I love disaster movie and I love the original Nihon chimbotsu and Jishin retto , I even like the latest Poseidon , not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence , New Nihon chimbotsu loos the point a many time a pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movie do show good disaster sequence , and also enough with the expensive FX that did not show anything , give me fake building if you like a long a you do destroy them properly , I know I must sound like a sadistic freak , however I did go to see Love actually when I felt like going to see a romantic film , grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei make me cry and this movie didn : t . there is also a TV series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975 , I have on DVD and it is much better",0
"it 's a lovely movie , it deeply reflects the Chinese underground band ' current life . if you chinese culture , traditionaled rock n roll music , there you go , i will highly recommend this one .but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie ha been showed in Mainland ? i sorta doubt it , :D",1
"IN COLD BLOOD ha to be ranked a first-rate movie-making , even if the subject matter is about a grim a it get in the world of make-believe , but film noir fan should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work , based a it is on a true-life crime spree . It open with Quincy Jones ' music under the credit and starkly dramatic view of a highway bus heading toward Kansas City , effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credit end . The B & W photography of Conrad Hall doe a superb job right from the start . Also clear from the start : ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are natural born actor . They do a great job of portraying free spirited buddy looking for the next thrill . `` Ever see a millionaire fry in the electric hair ? Hell no . There are two kind of rule in this world . One for the rich and one for the poor , '' say Wilson , taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel . Both are destined to cross the path of a farm family , showing no mercy and leaving no witness behind . Blake , reminiscing about movie , and thinking of hunting for gold in Mexico , say : `` Remember Bogart in 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre ' ? '' ( An ironic moment , because Blake himself wa in the film a a little boy selling lottery ticket ) . `` I got you pegged for a natural born killer , '' Wilson tell Blake . JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the lead detective on the case , discovering that all four family member were tied up , shot in the head and one had his throat cut . `` Do n't people around here lock door ? '' asks PAUL STEWART . `` They will tonight , '' is the terse reply . After the murder , the killer discover that there wa `` no big fat safe in the wall '' , like their prison informant told them . So , in the end , it wa truly a stupid , senseless crime . The question is : WHY did they do it ? And this is something the second half of the film explores in depth . It take an hour and a half into the movie before the detective catch up with the killer and begin the interrogation . It 's these final scene that carry the most conviction and the most interest a the boy are told they 've made numerous mistake and left a living witness . The actual event up to and including the murder are saved until the end . `` It make no sense , '' Blake tell Forsythe . `` Mr. Cutter wa a very nice gentleman . I thought so right up until the time I cut his throat . '' The screenplay by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point -- and so is his direction . Summing up : Brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere $ 43 . Chilling .",1
"It 's Die Hard meet Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorist and it 's up to one cop , Jack ( Crackerjack ) to stop this .

Thomas Ian Griffith a the cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer a terrorist . If you do n't like stupid B-action movie this is not for you .",0
"People like me will tear this movie apart . It 's just not realistic . The Plot is sooooooo predictable . You can anticipate everything that happens convientantly Of course , they find the treasure and become filthy rich , and trick the bad guy . We 've seen it a million time before . The writer of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid . They must be right because The majority of people actually liked this film . I mean solving riddle in a matter of second . The secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan subway ? You 'd think with all the work that 's gone on in New York underground That room would have been discovered before . and all that wa constructed during the civil war ? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail ? ? how cute , and I thought the romance in Clive Cussler novel wa weak . They just fall in love like that , in 2 second WHATEVER I 'd be more concerned with saving my own as then getting some . the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper . 1/10 Garbage",0
"I wa totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I wa only mildly amused ! I must say however , that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wa n't given a bigger and better role ! He wa an enormous talent . There is a great chemistry among all the main cast member and Matthau ha never been funnier . I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time ; in a vehicle that put their talent to great use . Brent Spiner prof that `` Data '' from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play . The storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the character work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this movie and I highly recommend it .",1
"The oddly-named Vera-Ellen wa to movie dancing what Sonja Henie wa to movie ice-skating : blonde , girlish , always delightful to watch , but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material . When I watch Vera-Ellen 's sexy apache dance with Gene Kelly in 'Words and Music ' , I ca n't help noticing that her blouse ( yellow with narrow red horizontal stripe ) seems to be made out of the South Vietnam flag . For some reason , the very American Vera-Ellen starred in * two * musical ( made several year apart ) set in Edinburgh , a city not noted for it tap-dancers : 'Let 's Be Happy ' and 'Happy Go Lovely ' . In the latter , Cesar Romero play an American impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in Edinburgh . There 's a vague attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival , which is nonsense : the Festival is not a showcase for splashy leg-shows . We also see a couple of stock shot of the Royal Mile : apart from a few Highland accent , there 's absolutely no attempt to convey Scottish atmosphere in this movie . The funniest gag occurs at the very beginning , when we learn that the title of Romero 's show is 'Frolics to You ' : this is a cheeky pun that Britons will get and Yanks wo n't . Vera-Ellen is , a usual , cute and appealing and an impressive dancer , but the very few musical number in this movie are boring and bad . The plot -- mistaken identity between magnate David Niven and reporter Gordon Jackson -- is brainless , though no more so than the plot of several dozen Hollywood musical . Romero is le annoying than usual here , probably because ( for once ) he is n't required to convince u that he 's interested in bedding the heroine . The single biggest offence of this movie is it misuse of Bobby Howes . The father of Sally Ann Howes wa a major star of West End stage musical ; his wistful rendition of `` She 's My Lovely '' wa a big hit in Britain in 1937 . Here , he show up in several scene a Romero 's dogsbody but never ha a chance to participate in a musical number , nor even any real comedy . It 's absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word 'Lovely ' , sure to evoke Howes 's greatest hit -- would cast a major British musical star but give him nothing to do ! The delightful character actress Ambrosine Phillpotts ( whom I worked with once ) shine in one restaurant sequence , and there 's a glimpse of the doomed beauty Kay Kendall . As Vera-Ellen 's confidante , somebody named Diane Hart speaks in one of the most annoying voice I 've ever heard : it sound like an attempt to imitate Joan Greenwood and Glynis Johns both at the same go , but doe n't match either . Val Guest ha a story credit , but this movie doe n't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedy . The colour photography is wretched , though I realise that postwar Britain could not afford Hollywood 's process work . 'Happy Go Lovely ' is at utmost best a pleasant time-waster , with 'waster ' being the operative word . I 'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10 .",0
"Once I watched The Tenant and interpreted it a a horror movie . It us many of the trope of the genre : the sinister apartment , suspicious neighbor , apparition , mystery , hallucination . The life of the hero , Trelkovsky , seemed surrounded by evil , secret force trying to drive him mad . Last time I watched it I challenged this initial interpretation . If this movie is a horror movie , it 's only horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is horror . In fact this movie can be understood on a literal level a a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence . Polanski made in his career three movie dealing with madness : Repulsion , which I do n't particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me ; Rosemary 's Baby , in which the heroine is driven mad by evil force ; and The Tenant , which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema . Trelkovsky is a young man who rent an apartment in which a woman killed herself . He becomes obsessed with her and slowly start becoming her : he wear her clothes , put on makeup , talk like her . But is he being possessed by a spirit , or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him ? It 's this hesitation between what is real and imaginary , and which Polanski never resolve , that make this such a fascinating movie . Many event in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural a easily a they can be to normal cause , and it 's up to the viewer to decide what to believe in . Although this is not my favorite Polanski movie , it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing term . And technically speaking , it 's a marvel too . Suffice to say he collaborates with film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary director of photography Sven Nykvist ( Bergman 's DP ) in the making of this movie . A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segment may make this movie difficult to enjoy , but it 's an experience nevertheless .",1
"Demi and Woody are married , but they 're poor . They meet Robert Redford , and he 's REALLY rich . He take a fancy to Demi , and since he 's a gambling man he make the couple an `` indecent proposal : '' one million dollar for a night with the little woman . At this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the detail together in your sleep . Of course Demi is going to accept the offer . If she doe n't there 's no first half of the movie . Of course it will affect Demi and Woody 's marriage . If it doe n't there 's no second half of the movie . And of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credit roll . If it doe n't , there 's no happy ending for the sake of box office . The absolute best thing you can say about INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore look good in a black dress . As for the rest ... The script is incompetent , the direction amateurish , the performance negligible . I suspect Redford , Moore , and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned . Do them -- and more importantly yourself -- a favor . Unless some one offer you a million ... Miss It ! Gary F. Taylor , aka GFT , Amazon Reviewer",0
"The `` Wrinkle in Time '' book series is my favorite series from childhood . I have read and re-read them more time than I can count over the last 35+ year . The character , with all their virtue and flaw , are near and dear to my heart . This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful , magical , spiritual story that I love so much . To say I wa disappointed with this film would be a great understatement . If you have never read the book ( s ) I imagine you will enjoy the movie . The acting is passable , the special effect are well done for a made for TV movie , and the story is interesting . However , if you love the book , avoid this movie at all cost . I found this statement at the Wikipedia page of the novel : `` In an interview with Newsweek , L'Engle said of the film , ' I expected it to be bad , and it is . ' '' I , like another reviewer here , feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .",0
"I 've seen this film criticized with the statement , `` If you can get past the moralizing ... '' That miss the point . Moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder , a it were . This is a decent film with a standard murder mystery , but with a distinct twist that surface midway through . The resolution leaf the viewer wondering , `` What would I have done in this position ? '' And I have to believe that 's exactly what the filmmaker intended . To that end , and to the end of entertaining the audience , the film succeeds . I also like the way that the violence is never on stage , but just off camera . We know what ha just happened ; it 's just not served up in front of u , then rubbed in our face , a it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing . Besides , the violence is not the point . The point is the protagonist 's moral dilemma , which is cleverly , albeit disturbingly , resolved .",1
"I must warn you , there are some spoiler in it . But to start it off , I got `` Spanish Judges '' on February I think . It wa mention it wa the last copy , but a I see , it wa n't back-ordered . But either way , I have it . I thought it wa good . I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor , Matthew Lillard ( I 'm surprised no one on the review mention the scar ) although it is kind of low budget , getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending . Man , what a good actor . The story it about a con artist known a Jack ( Matthew Lillard ) who `` claim '' to have merchandise called The Spanish Judges . If you do n't know what Spanish Judges are or have n't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read , I wo n't even say what they are . I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it wa . He need protection , so he hire a couple who are also crook , Max and Jamie ( Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino ) a well a a crook that go by the name of Piece ( Mark Boone Junior ) . He ha a girlfriend who wo n't even tell anyone her name because she 's from Mars , a she said . So they ( mainly Jack ) call her `` Mars Girl '' . Everything start out fine , but then it turn to one big game . A game that involves some lust , lie and betrayal . There wa some over acting in it ( Matt and Valeria , a well a Tamara , were not one of them ) . There were some scene they could 've done better and the score could 've been a little better a well . Some of the score wa actually good . The theme they used for the beginning and the end ( before the credit ) wa a good song choice , that 's my opinion . The fight scene in the end could 've been a little longer and a little more violent , but what can you do ? One more comment on Matt : Damn , he play a smooth , slick con man . I know this is a review , but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo , one of the reviewer : Valeria Golino is not a newcomer . According to this site , she ha been acting since 1983 . To me , and hopefully to others , she is well known a Charlie Sheen 's Italian love interest in both the `` Hot Shots ! '' movie . But good review . Although I think it 's one of the rare film I 've seen and it 's really good ( which is why I gave it 10 star above ) , I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it . 8/10",1
"Not the best of the film to be watched nowadays . I read a lot of review about Shining and wa expecting it to be very good . But this movie disappointed me . The sound and environment wa good , but there wa no story here . Not wa there a single moment of fright . I expected it to a horror thriller movie , but there wa no horror no thriller . The only scene where I got scared wa during the chapter change scene showing `` Wednesday '' . There are lot of fragment i the movie . Most of the thing are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything . The story doe not tell u about the woman or other scene that is shown . Might be a good movie to watch in the 80 's , but not for the 21st century .",0
"I had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni 's passing with numerous unwatched film of his that I own on VHS ; however , given my ongoing light-hearted Christmas marathon , I had to make do with just this one ! As it happens , it feature one of his best performance - and he wa justly Oscar-nominated for it ( with the film itself being likewise honored ) . This wa also one of 14 collaboration with that other most widely-recognized star to emerge from Italy , Sophia Loren ; both , incidentally , are playing against type here - she a an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual ! By the way , the film 's title ha a double meaning : the leading character are brought together on the historic day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini ( the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage ) , but it more specifically refers to the star ' 'brief encounter ' in which they share moment of friendship , revelation and , briefly , passion - though each know that a return to their normal existence is inevitable , which lead to the film 's abrupt bittersweet ending . This is virtually a two-hander ( with all other character - save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story take place in it entirety - which include Loren 's gruff and fervently patriotic husband , surprisingly played by John Vernon , appear only at the beginning and closing sequence ) ; still , the cramped setting doe n't deter director Scola ( for the record , this is the 7th film of his that I 've watched and own 3 more on VHS ) and cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis , so that the result - though essentially low-key - is far from stagy : the camera is allowed to prowl the various section of the large building , observing the proceeding intimately or dispassionately a the situation requires , but always keenly . The narrative , of course , depends entirely on the performance of the two star for it to be convincing , and they both deliver ( their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable ) ; it 's interesting , however , that while Loren walked away with the prize in their home turf , it 's Mastroianni 's moving yet unsentimental outsider ( the film , somewhat dubiously , doe seem to equate his sexual deviance with Anti-Fascism ! ) who generally impressed international audience !",1
"Actually , Goldie Hawn is from Washington ( Takoma Park , Maryland ) , but I digress . This is sort of a Mr. Smith go to Washington type of movie , with some variation but the same premise . I taped this movie off of cable year ago because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn . The story is interesting , but it 's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot 's life . It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time . It made me laugh because some of the situation she found herself in were so ridiculous , I had to laugh . ( POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD ) . It made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she wa set up . And the speech she made at the end ... beautiful . Too bad not many people have gut like that in real life .",1
"I wa looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality a Frontline or `` Fog of War '' ( by Errol Morris ) . Instead I wa appalled by this shallow and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime : Alberto Fujimori . This movie should be called `` The return of Fujimori '' . The director presumes she made a `` perfect '' movie because alienates both pro and anti-Fujimori faction when in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional piece of work . The movie ha few crucial fact wrong : 1 ) She us the so called `` landslide '' election of 1995 in which Fujimori wa re-elected with 65 % of the vote , a an example of the massive popular support of Fujimori . But we all now know to be the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud . 2 ) The movie state that Sendero Luminoso ( Shining Path ) killed 60,000 people . In fact , the Truth Commission 's final report state that there were 69,280 death due to political violence in Peru . 33 % of those were caused by SL . That leaf the other 67 % in the hand of the police , military and other group . The fact that she us the same misleading information that Fujimori ha been using for 10 year it is another example of how terrible this movie is . For any person with some education on Peruvian politics and history , Fujimori is clearly a consummated manipulator , a delusional character and remorseless egomaniac . His regime wa very far from being democratic . He is still a menace to Peruvians . Despite these fact the director let Fujimori tell the story . Not only on how he want the camera to be positioned but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda . He always seems to have the last word . There are no journalistic `` cojones '' , just soft question and unchallenged remark . Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her ? The director , when questioned after the screening , did n't hide the fact that she wa deeply impressed by Fujimori , his charm and intelligence . Yes , she ha been definitely charmed by him , and you can tell by looking at this film . It 's obvious she ha a very hard time to digest the multitude of fact that point towards his responsibility on the corruption , murder and deception that took place . She assured the gasping audience that Fujimori wa really a `` patriot '' when few moment earlier , one of the leading Peruvian journalist wa very adamant in telling u that Fujimori wa , above all , a `` traitor '' . She went on to say that despite all the accusation not `` a single dollar '' wa found on any bank account on his name , etc , etc . It wa like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thug that ruled the country for 10 year defending their master . It wa a sad moment for journalism . This film make injustice to history . It is an insult to hundred of dead people , disappeared or unjustly incarcerated by Fujimori 's regime . No wonder she later confessed that all the Peruvian intellectual she befriended while making the movie felt betrayed by it . Unbiased ? The word `` oportunistic '' , `` naïve '' and `` denial '' come to my mind instead .",0
"For anyone with a moderate sensibility , a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition , for anyone capable of getting above the Hollywood ilk , for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which doe not have a series of Seagals/Willis/Van Dammes blasting the brain out of anybody or seeing who get into bed with whom , for anyone whose intellectual level reach a capacity to grasp , sympathise with , comprehend , laugh WITH , cry WITH natural tender heart-warming hilarious compassionate HUMAN BEINGS , ` Le Huitième Jour ' is waiting for you . Jaco van Dormael ha not achieved simply a masterpiece , that would have been too simplistic ; he ha achieved one of those rare monumental work of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling . Is it a drama ? Is it a comedy ? No : it is the story of Georges , a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality , a sufferer of the Downes Syndrome . It is a story which ha you laughing through your tear , but this is not one of those classic tear-jerkers ; this film move through a world that ha you at once mixing your feeling of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration , warmth and even love . A successful banking salesman , Harry , bump into Georges : they were both going in opposite direction with absolutely opposing idea , problem and priority ; skillfully van Dormael melt these two unlikely men into a warm friendship , but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road . This is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other . The cuasi-surrealist scene fit in perfectly : Georges recall ( or invents ) past scene of his life while either day-dreaming or sleeping ; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct . The only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show-rooms . However , this doe not detract from the whole . This film is a monument . Even if your French is not up to much , please bear seeing it with sub-titles . ` Le Huitième Jour ' is worth the trouble . As for anything else , well , just read the following commentary  I go along with all of them . This film is a joy , it is majestic , it is unique . If you have seen ` Rain Man ' which I consider an excellent film , you must see this one : it is far superior because it ha not the superficial veneer of famous Hollywood-produced world-renowned actor ; it ha Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil  TEN oscar for these two , and three more for Jaco van Dormael . Who care ? Yes : 11 out of 10 if the IMDb rating doe n't break down under the strain . Magnifique ! Chapeau !",1
"I am stunned to discover the amount of fan this show ha . Have n't said that Friends wa , at best an 'average ' sitcom , and not a great a others have made out . Let 's face it , if it wa n't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette , David Schwimmer , Matthew Perry , Lisa Kudrow , Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc , then who know whether this show would 've lasted a long a it ha done . I very much doubt that . Although a the series progressed , Friends got more progressively predictable , lame and boring that I could n't care le about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight , nor of who wa sleeping with whom . And it went from being funny in the first four season to occasionally funny . And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actor from the movie world , I still did n't bother to tune in . The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and a for the ending , well it wa predictable to say the least . What wa annoying though wa that this lasted for ten season , whilst some of my favourite show lasted for only three , four season for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good . The show should 've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salary . In truth , a much a the series waned , it wa the show that wa bigger than the actor themselves , not the other way round . When it ended in 2004 , I wa so relieved to see the back of this sitcom . Now , there is talk of a friend reunion show coming to our TV screen very soon . And yet , I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever .",0

"The exclamation point in the title is appropriate , albeit an understatement . This movie doe n't just cry -- it shriek loud enough to shatter glass . Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrill , humorless suspense thriller that strove for a semi-documentary feel . Here , they shot on actual New York location with tinny `` real-life '' acoustic to jack up the verisimilitude . But the naturalism of the sound recording only serf to amplify the Stones ' maladroit dialog and the mouth-frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly Inger Stevens . In a performance completely devoid of modulation , Stevens play the wife of electronics whiz James Mason ( looking haggard and bored ) ; both are held captive by extortionist Rod Steiger ( looking bloated and bored ) and his slimy cohort in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason ha unwittingly helped construct . Here is another credibility-straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail , yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug-addicted degenerate a an underling . The Stones ' idea of nail-biting tension is to trap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrine-popping rapist Neville Brand , filling the frame with his sweaty , drooling kisser . But the camera work is so leaden and Brand so ( uncharacteristically ) demure that the effect is hardly lurid , much le suspenseful . The Stones , a square pair at heart , do n't even have the courage of their own lack of conviction . The film , which end with the portly Steiger chasing the fleet-footed Stevens on a subway train track , is a clumsy a it ungainly heavy . With Angie Dickinson a Steiger 's amoral girlfriend , Jack Klugman , Kenneth Tobey , and Barney Philips .",0
"Robert Carlyle excels again . The period wa captured well and the soundtrack , although hearing modern techno in this period piece wa a little disconcerting at first , proved to be very well chosen . Well worth a watch .",1
"This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who get up to all sort of merry mishap . I remember watching Mr Bean with my family back in 1990 , when I wa still a child . My family laughed so hard at every episode , and the content of which still come up in our daily conversation twenty year later . The memorable scene which are still in my head include Mr Bean attempting to get out of his car park , shooting out the light , counting sheep , and him in the swimming pool . We bought all the Mr Bean video on VHS , no mater how expensive they were . It wa worth it because we watched them over and over again ! It is so rare to see a very funny TV series that is suitable for all age .",1
The movie wa disappointing . The book wa powerful . The view and the learning of Little Tree were powerfully portrayed in the book . The movie just coasted along and finally dribbled away . Still a nice tale for kid .,0
"So often these `` Lifetime '' flick are one-dimension , with over-the-top characterization and performance , and with contrived plot line and climax which are intended to trade any semblance of reality for drama . But most of all , many of these flick provide character where it 's difficult to feel a trace of sympathy or empathy for even the `` good guy/good gal '' character , much le the '' bad '' one . However , here the performance were all good , the character realistic , and the relationship among the three lead ( a well a the ex-husband/father and the two female ) rang true throughout . The mother 's boyfriend wa portrayed a being about halfway in age between mother and daughter , and the actor were age-appropriate to this in term of their actual age . None of the character wa portrayed at an extreme - either all-good or all-bad - and all rang true . Without in any way condoning his allowing the relationship with his prospective stepdaughter to advance to the level which it did - you can still feel some sympathy for him without retracting blame . Neither mother nor daughter were perfect , neither good nor bad , but simply two individual whose relationship seemed realistic and not contrived by the script writer . Lifetime flick - even those which begin with some semblance of normality - often end with a deranged character brandishing a carving knife or such . Other story seem to need to provide the `` everyone lived happily ever-after '' close . This film presented a realistic premise , story and resolution , from start to finish - a welcomed variation to the norm of this genre/",1
"Sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hand ( Wayne 's World , the first one , not the second ) . But most often they have dud ( It 's Pat come to mind rather quickly ) . This time out it 's Tim Meadows a The Ladies Man . This movie fall somewhere in between a hit and a dud . It wa very funny for the first 20 minute , but then , a usually happens with SNL skit , it start to slow down , before finally ending , long after it should have . Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps , a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man . He answer any and all question dealing with sex and relationship , usually in the crudest way possible . Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt . After pushing the button of the station manager , Leon , along with his producer Julie ( Karyn Parsons ) get fired , and need to find another job . Out of the random blue , come a letter from one of his ex-ladies . The letter offer him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life , the only problem being that the letter is n't signed . So Leon need to track down all the woman he 's been with to find the woman of his dream . But sometimes , a Billy Dee Williams say in the film , the woman of your dream is standing right in front of you . There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guy who 's wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon , and they want to first figure out who he is ( by a tattoo he ha on a part of his anatomy ) , then kill him . Leading this bunch of guy is , surprise ! Will Ferrell from SNL . First off , I thought the sub-plot wa rather lame . The singing and dancing stuff wa just completely worthless . I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me . And the rest of the guy were just schlubs who tagged along , and in the end all decided that having their wives/girlfriends cheat on them wa in fact their fault . So back to the main story . The story basically center around Leon and sex . So what it come down to is , if you do n't like the character of Leon , you wo n't like the movie . His voice , his mannerism , his dialogue is what carry the movie . I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows . I never thought he wa a particularly good actor on SNL . The only thing I ever really liked of his , wa his Ladies Man skit . But the best thing about those , is that they usually involved the guest host ( remember the one with Cameron Diaz ? ) , and they were short . For about 5 minute , they were pretty funny . And here , for about 20 minute , it 's really funny . What I thought wa good about the character in the movie , is that he stayed in character throughout . He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona . Until right at the end where there wa this transformation , and the ever present speech to tie thing up . Other than that , it wa pretty good at keeping Leon a Leon , and not changing him into something le crude than he wa . There is n't a lot of substance to this movie , if you could n't guess . But like I said earlier , the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny . Some real laugh out loud moment , all revolving around sex and his crudeness . The problem of course with this movie , and most other SNL spin offs , is that these are character that are only supposed to be shown for a few minute at a time . Stretching the concept into 80 minute is very difficult . That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot , because without it , this movie would have been a little under an hour . When it wa good , it wa good , but when it wa n't good , it got to be boring . So overall , The Ladies Man wa n't a bad a other SNL film , but it wa n't a good a others . It had some funny moment , the first 20 minute wa pretty good , but the rest of it dragged on . There wa an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose wa to lengthen the film . The bottom line is , if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character , you 'll be able to watch the film . If he annoys you , do n't even bother going . Unless you just want to see Tiffani Theissen in some nice revealing clothing .",1
"Like most other people , I saw this movie on `` Mystery Science Theater 3000 . '' Although it received some well-deserved barb , it 's one of the better film to be featured on that show . The premise is better than even your average Hollywood blockbuster these day ; it pose some interesting moral dilemma . Although the score is sometimes obtrusive , it also provides a few lovely moment when Richard is walking by the river . Watching the movie , you can see where a lot of plot development probably looked very good on paper . Richard 's discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to ponder , and the ending probably would have been a nice '70s-style mindfuck if the preceding affair had n't been so goofy . Unfortunately , the movie is visibly cheap , making the flaw all the more obvious . The `` clone farm '' is very obviously a college campus , and a beer can serf a a major plot point . Lena and Richard have zero chemistry -- we are supposed to believe this is a meeting of kindred mind , but there doe n't seem to be a brain cell between them . The `` cranky old couple '' schtick also get real old , real fast . There are also some mistake that can be blamed on bad directorial choice , such a the decision to hold a climactic conversation out of reach of any audio equipment whatsoever . In all , a noble effort , but is nonetheless best viewed on MST3K .",0
"David Lynch 's ninth full length feature film , Mulholland Drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy . If anything , it brutally contrast our ambition and hope to the often bitter truth . Every frame of this movie ha importance and link to other part and to themselves at the same time . Nothing is what it first appears to be and you 're left with a real puzzle a you end up trying to put the piece together . It is a movie that doe not compromise , nor doe it fail to fully handle the challenging form and camera language , a might have been the case earlier with Lost Highway . Although one clearly recognizes classic lynchian motif and device , the movie remains highly original , even in the light of it being a Lynch movie . Lost Highway marked a new way of telling a story ; bred an unconventional mean of setting emotion on to the screen . With Mulholland Drive , Lynch not only managed to control this technique , but take it to new level in making it much more complex and multi dimensional . In doing this , he creates a framework of different layer in time and of the human mind . In a press conference on the Cannes film festival 2001 , David Lynch said that striving for perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the part . Talking about synergy like this becomes highly relevant to Mulholland Dr. where the different sequence and many detail contribute to the total ; dreamscapes and parallel intertwine to create the story . In some art , the beauty of it lie in it simpleness . This is not the case with Mulholland Drive , and ha never been with Lynch . It is the complexity that color and build the world Lynch creates , the same complexity that characterizes the real world . It never get forced like , in my opinion , for example Memento doe , using an original way of communicating with the viewer . Further comparing Mulholland Drive to other movie , I think it prof David Lynch a a master of what he doe and bridge art and film making in a way that no one ha ever done . Compared to for example Alejandro Jodorowsky or contemporary Matthew Barney , I do believe that Lynch more clearly manages not letting the artist dominate the film maker or , more likely , David Lynch better understands and executes film making a an art form . Understanding the plot is no small feat , but Lynch 's way of working with sound , perspective , chronology and form paint a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feel more realistic than real life . The lynchian cinema is often , and most definitely in Mulholland Drive , a surge of human emotion . Working with emotion is a delicate craft that demand understanding and depth . As Lynch put it : `` A little bit too much , and the emotion go away . A little bit too little , and it doe n't happen . '' In Mulholland Drive , David Lynch ha no problem making this balance . Lynch 's portrait span all kind of dimension and take different direction , creating incredibly realistic character and situation . Watching Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious . It is a truthful and naked movie with indisputable artistic value . That is why I love Mulholland Drive and what 's taken it to the pinnacle of cinema history . The ultimate movie .",1
"Power ranger , the moronic merchandising television kid show from the 1990s , ha got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created . What exactly is the point of this show anyway , other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to child ? There is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway . Look at the costume , which look like spandex gone bad . The mullet style hair , earring , and fashion of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these day . Avoid this show at all cost !",0
I have to agree with the previous author 's comment about the excellent performance and plot . Started watching this movie by accident ... ( lazy Sunday afternoon clicking channel to see if anything good wa on ) ... and wa mesmerized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez . Wow ! Gut wrenching ! Kudos to everyone ( have always admired Martin Sheen ) but wa particularly impressed with Emilio ! Excellent job of acting and directing ... simply superb ! So why have I never heard of this movie before ? I 'll have to spread the news .,1
"Okay , I 'm just going to disagree with the past comment that criticized this show . I happen to think this show is awesome . ( I mean when Jasmin Weber wa still on and Franzi wa still alive , so addicting ! ) . And I wa surprised to learn that this wa categorized a a soap , because it just doe n't carry the same look and feel a soap in America . Soaps here are absolutely horrific ! At least GZSZ film on location , feature real music and more plausible story line . Moreover , the acting on GZSZ , for the most part , is quite believable especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff . ( Plus , soap actor are some of the hardest worker around in the business a they have the most demanding work schedule ) . If it 's rating are that high , it must be doing something right ; soap in America are shown in the day-time and , historically , have always had rock-bottom rating . Give GZSZ a chance ! Trust me , it 's good !",1
"I wa so let down by this film . The tag line wa something like 'The story of a girl sexual awakening ' . You can only imagine how disappointed I wa . I wa seventeen at the time and I took my girlfriend to see it . I thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend gagging for it . Sadly that wa not the case . I guess we just were n't ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we just did n't posse at the time . I 'm not so sure I posse it now , and I have long since parted company with that particular girlfriend ( pity really ... my first love ) . We left the cinema half way through the film , my friend , who should have known better , stayed for the whole thing . I still got the required result with my girlfriend , the film just did n't help much . It would be interesting to see it again so that I can make a more informed critique , though I feel the experience ha left me scarred for life .",0
"Deep Shock play out like a TV movie : a whole cast of commercial-quality actor , a poorly designed creature to be the `` bad guy , '' and a script that is more full of technical , political jargon and importance than it know what to do with . I checked out the movie because of the creature ( I love to see what filmmaker have in mind for their design in these cheaply made video ) , and right off the bat , I got disappointed because the creature on the box wa not the one in the movie . The actor I expected because of the type of film it is ( really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point ) . The music wa typical , not-thought-out action symphonic music . I liked the design of the computer and technical equipment , along with the mini-sub design . The movie even flowed really well , with guiding screen letting you know which set you 're watching the story unfold in . But there is n't much of a story here anyways . This movie get a 3/10 star IMO . The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creature protecting it ... kinda lame . Even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the character that you do n't see coming . Chalk this one up to being a movie which try to get actor ' career off the bench and into a video . Do n't bother .",0
"An absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousy and infidelity surrounding a beetle marriage , Russian animation pioneer Wladyslaw Starewicz 's `` Mest kinematograficheskogo operatora '' ( `` The Cameraman 's Revenge '' , or `` The Revenge of a Kinematograph Cameraman '' ) is a delight of early animation , brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination . Mr. and Mrs. Beetle have a completely uneventful marriage , and both yearn for more excitement in their life . Mr. Beetle 's desire can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the `` Gay Dragonfly '' night club , whom he visit whenever he take a `` business trip '' to the city . She is the only one who understands him . A fellow admirer of this dancer , an aggressive grasshopper , is jealous that Mr. Beetle ha stolen his lady and , a fate would have it , he is also a movie cameraman . The devious grasshopper follows Mr. Beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room , where he film their exploit through the keyhole . Meanwhile , Mrs. Beetle ha , likewise , acquired a friend to add excitement to her life . He is an artist , and he brings her a painting for a present , before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy . At that moment , however , Mr. Beetle return home and witness the entire spectacle . As Mr. Beetle bash through the front door , the artist friend clamber up the chimney , but he doe n't escape without Mr. Beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him . There is a certain irony in the statement that follows : `` Mr. Beetle is generous . He forgives his wife and take her to a movie . '' He is generous enough to forgive her , and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minute earlier . At this point in time , however , we still have n't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge , and it is no surprise when he turn out to be the projectionist for the film Mr. and Mrs. Beetle are attending . Suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of Mr. Beetle 's disloyalty , and the angry wife hit him across the head with an umbrella , before the frightened and angry husband dive through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper . In the final scene , both Mr. and Mrs. Beetle , now somewhat more appreciative of each other , are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when Mr. Beetle sought his final revenge . We do , indeed , hope that `` the home life of the Beetles will be le exciting in the future '' This film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect specie , but Starewicz is communicating so much more than that . This is n't a story about beetle  it is a story about u . And it 's startlingly accurate , is n't it ? !",1
"Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that I feel compelled to warn people . If I labor all my day and I can save but one soul from watching this movie , how great will be my joy . Where to begin my discussion of pain . For starter , there wa a musical montage every five minute . There wa no character development . Every character wa a stereotype . We had swearing guy , fat guy who eats donut , goofy foreign guy , etc . The script felt a if it were being written a the movie wa being shot . The production value wa so incredibly low that it felt like I wa watching a junior high video presentation . Have the director , producer , etc . ever even seen a movie before ? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry . The concept for this movie sounded so funny . How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actor . But trust me when I say this , thing went wrong , VERY WRONG .",0
"* SPOILERS * I 'm sure back when this wa released in 1958 it wa much appropriate for it time . Back then film were slower paced to allow audience to follow and analyze the story . Here a man move into a house owned by his last wife that died mysteriously with his new wife . The gardener Mickey ( played by Alex Nicol , who also directed he film ) really is an underappreciated character . He get a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she is in trouble , since he knew that there wa foul play in the first wife 's death . He ca n't tell Jenni directly what happened , so he try to scare her off with the skull . Jenni , we also find out , saw her parent die , thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that lead to institutionalization . Like many audience today , I found the pacing to be a little too slow for my taste . But if you like slow-paced horror without a lot of gore , this film is for you .",0
"It 's a bit unnerving when a studio decline to screen a film for the press before it go into wide release . That many movie suck is no surprise , but when a studio itself admits a much ahead of time , the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sort . Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood , then , that `` Aeon Flux '' is n't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect , given the above . Though ultimately overwhelmed by it flaw , it at least ha ( sort of ) an idea with which to toy around . Too bad director Karyn Kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it all . It 's the future . There 's been a plague . There is a dictatorship , and there are rebel . The latter are known a the Monicans , and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshiper , they 're into attempt to overthrow the former , called the Goodchild regime . The regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry , which is more than Aeon Flux ( Charlize Theron ) and her pal can stand . Through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology , the Monicans receive order from their dear leader ( Frances McDormand ) , a mystical priestess-type who appears to have been cross-bred with a carrot . It fall to Aeon to strap on some form-fitting , futuristic spandex get-ups to carry out the High Carrot 's order , which are of course some version of `` destroy the regime . '' Having year earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the Goodchilds , she need little convincing . Not surprisingly , thing get complicated . The Goodchilds might not be quite what they seem , and Aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them . Though occasionally muddled , the film 's central conceit ( of which I wo n't reveal more ) contains some neat notion about the nature of human existence and survival . There 's room for much more examination of which the film doe n't take advantage , but the idea are there , at least . The big problem of `` Aeon Flux '' are technical . Kusama ha made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what 's going on . To make matter worse , it 's edited in a flurry of jump cut that leave u completely lost . The result is some serious spacial disorientation that take over the film . `` Aeon Flux '' 's aesthetic is one of sleek costume , oddly-angled architecture , and nimble character . Much of the action occurs in minimalist , open space that beg for some unbroken long shot that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above . Instead , we get split second of flying limb , breaking glass , and accompanying sound effect . There is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of `` Aeon Flux . '' Put this stuff in the hand of the Wachowski brother , say , and the result could be quite different . As it is , though , I felt like `` Aeon Flux '' wa willfully pushing me away from a movie I wanted to enjoy . This film is unattuned to it own strength . Like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush , it somehow find a way to lose in spite of it potential .",0
"I admit I had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece . It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all I knew . It began with great visuals , little snippet to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild . As it continued I learned quickly through voice over what wa taking place . A nice little neo noir story that I felt wa not a waist of a few minute of my time . The little clue given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment a they piece together the plot . Along with a nice twist at the end it a cool package overall . The score , though not bad , gave the film almost a music video feel . It just felt a little dated , not adding anything to further the storyline . Some of the performance felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece . I walk away from this very satisfied . I wa given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice-over work it did n't feel rushed or pushed . Great job !",1
"This is a really fun , breezy , light hearted romantic comedy . You can not go wrong with Meg Ryan 's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein 's genius . Normally , I 'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tale about actual people , now deceased and not able to defend themselves , but I think the late Einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one . It 's the 1950 's ... Princeton , New Jersey in the spring . The story revolves around a pretty , young , scatter brained mathematician , Catherine ( Meg Ryan ) , who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk , a behavioral researcher named James , merely because he ha the brain she 's looking for in the father of her future child . However , it 's love at first sight when her car break and she meet an auto mechanic named Ed ( Tim Robbins ) . As she doe n't think Ed is intelligent enough , her uncle , none other than Albert Einstein , play match maker , assisted in his endeavor by three mischievous crony , all theoretical physicist . Uncle Albert must make Ed appear suitably smart , so concocts a charade portraying him a a physicist ... naturally with amusing result . Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self , and pull off the character of Einstein quite effectively . With his three professorial buddy , Kurt , Nathan , and Boris , a lot of laugh ensue . The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film just take it one ( outrageous ) step further . If you suspend all logic , you can almost imagine this silly story happening ! It might not be rocket science ( despite it main character ) but it is a wonderful sweet , refreshing movie . One of the best of the comedy romance genre .",1

"The basis for this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card player ever . STUEY is a tight , cohesive biopic of a true poker Ace whose life is a one-way trip down the Highway to Hell with few detour . This dramatic feature stand wide apart from other film about poker . It represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling compulsion . The complete obsession that annihilates any proximity of spirituality and nullifies any chance of redemption . This is the least likely movie a Vegas Casino executive would recommend . And it is the sole poker DVD you are likely to find on the shelf of Gamblers Annonymous . There are scene in this movie that poker buff are sure to refer to a some of the best gambling scene ever . Stu reading his opponent 's hand and , particularly , a Texas hold'em bluffing scene . Prophetically , early on in the movie we see a young Stu bullied out of his pocket change by a bunch of neighborhood hoodlum . Poker is for loner seeking revenge . It is a game of patience which bully lack . 'You ca n't bully me ! ' may very well be an underlying sentiment of the punishing force that a champion poker player unleashes upon his adversary . Conservatives will look upon this film a a cautionary tale of a soul lost in sin . They may evoke Mark Twain : 'The best throw at dice is to throw them away . ' The young and liberal mass will inevitably have a more simplistic and sympathetic outlook . They may not have heard of Twain 's quote , but will sure remember a remark made by Stu 's stunned pal who learns from up-and-coming Stuey that he 'd won a car from a local character in an overnight game . 'You tell'em to go to hell and they look forward to the trip ' . The mosaic of Las Vegas vignette that we see in STUEY will long linger in memory . Frank Sinatra , the most generous tipper ? Forget about it ! Nobody tip a extravagantly a a hot-shot gambler . And for Vegas visitor who may not know the impact of tipping on the quality of their stay , check out the scene of Stu checking in a Vegas hotel ! 'This is what i wa meant to do , this is where i wa to be . Movie star in Hollywood , politician in Washington and gambler in Vegas . '",1
"A slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black woman by white men of power and privilege . Ooh . Does that whet your appetite ? Well , then , belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history . For good measure , it 's adapted from the book by celebrated hack Anne Rice . The directing is a cloying and melodramatic a the cheesy dialog . Most of acting is amateurish . The production 's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actor , all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today 's market ( Jasmine Guy , Ben Vereen , Pam Grier , Eartha Kitt ) , including some face that have barely been seen at all ( Bianca Lawson , Rachel Cuttrell ) . It also is , despite itself , a sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn . The pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is on-hand a well . So , is the late Ossie Davis , a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company . This film should be rated `` T '' for tripe .",0
"Well , when before I saw this film I really wa n't sure whether it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I wa !

I 've not read the book ( maybe that 's a good thing & meant I enjoyed the film more ) but with regard to the story , I really ca n't think of any bad point , hence scoring it 10 out of 10 ( and I hardly ever think anything warrant top mark ! ) . By the time William proclaimed ' I CAN RIDE MY BIKE , DAD ! ' I wa sobbing my heart out ( anyone who 's seen it will understand , I 'm sure ) . Really heartwarming , and definitely recommended .",1

It reminded me of all of those 80 ninja movie that took old Kung Fu movie and spliced in a bunch of white ninja running doing cartwheel with the word `` ninja '' written on their headband ( if you have n't seen them , check out `` Ninja Terminator '' , `` The Thundering Ninja '' , `` Black Dragon '' and `` Ninja Warriors '' ) . Thanks Roger Corman ; you just made me waste a dollar .",0
"It 's often said that Tobe Hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ' and every time I see another Hooper film - that view is only reinforced . It would seem that Hooper wanted to make his own version of film such a Scanners and Firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with Spontaneous Combustion ; a film with a couple of good idea and a whole load more that are borrowed from other film . Put it all together and you get a messy , boring film that most people would do well to miss ! The film lead the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focus on some experiment carried out on two young people in the fifty . The couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death a a result of the experiment done on them . Fast forward some year and the baby is now an adult named Sam ; but naturally he 's not a normal person and soon find when it 's discovered that he ha the ability to set thing on fire at will . The film star Brad Dourif , who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with Child 's Play two year earlier ; but actually wa an uninspired decision a the central performance is really terrible ; and not helped by the terrible supporting performance . The turgid direction and dull script also do n't do the film many favour and the trend of lacking in favour is continued by the special effect , which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the film that this one is ripping off ; all of which were made some year earlier . The plot is really slow and it 's almost an hour before anything of note happens , and I did n't care for it even then . It soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boil down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect . The final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film . Not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway . Overall , this is a rubbish film and another reason why Tobe Hooper is a long way from being a great horror director . See Firestarter again instead .",0
"Unbelievably close to real life feeling and emotion captured by Joseph Mazzello a a hemophiliac child affected by AIDS and his new young neighbor , a wanna-be tough redneck played to perfection by Brad Renfro . Although the story may seem slightly farfetched ( the two boy attempt to river-raft several hundred mile to find a doctor who claim to have the cure to AIDS ) , the emotion , action and interaction of all character involved are tragically close to real life . Being a `` big brother '' to a boy in a similar situation who died a few year after this film wa released , I strongly recommend this picture to anyone who ha ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS . Superb direction by Peter Horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draw the viewer into the various emotion affected by friendship , illness , prejudice and the final parting of two friend who fought hard to overcome adversity .",1
"It may be a remake of the 1937 film by Capra , but it is wrong to consider it only in that way ! It wa supposed to expose Hilton 's novel in a completely different way . As a musical is excellent . The scenery is terrific , the character good and anyone like `` Leonard Maltin '' who considers the Bacharach music awful must be completely deaf ! I strongly recommend it .",1
"Fiction film ( it list a based on a story though it doe have a `` documented by '' credit ) about a group of scientist going into the wild of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot . ( They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device ) . Its lot of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness . There are some attempt at creating tension and scare , but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shot of the wild . This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film , it promise you so much , a look at Bigfoot , but in reality it delivers very little . Recommended for insomniac only",0
"`` Crossfire '' is ostensibly a murder mystery but what distinguishes it from other similar movie of the period is the killer 's motive , which is anti-Semitism . The story highlight example of the kind of ignorance which fuel bigotry and contains reference to a `` hillbilly '' and an Irish immigrant who also suffered maltreatment because of their ethnicity . The movie 's plot is based on Richard Brooks ' novel called `` The Brick Foxhole '' which is about a hate crime where the victim wa gay . It 's ironic that this story about a form of intolerance should be met with intolerance by the censor who stipulated that , for the screen version , the type of bigotry involved should be changed to anti-Semitism . Another irony is the behaviour of a soldier who seems fiercely proud of having served in a war against the Nazis and yet embrace their hatred of Jews . The director and producer of this movie also suffered another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the `` House Un-American Activities Committee '' . All these point just seem to underline the deeply entrenched and intractable nature of the whole problem of bigotry a depicted in this movie . When Police Captain Finlay ( Robert Young ) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels ( Sam Levene ) , he discovers that on the night when he wa killed , Samuels had been socialising with a group of soldier and one of these , Corporal Arthur `` Mitch '' Mitchell ( George Cooper ) is quickly identified a the prime suspect . Further information is also gathered from Montgomery ( Robert Ryan ) who is another of the soldier who wa present that night and Sergeant Keeley ( Robert Mitchum ) who 's a friend of Mitchell . Keeley , with the help of some other soldier , then search for Mitchell and when he find him , hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder including his meeting with a dance hall hostess called Ginny Tremaine ( Gloria Grahame ) . Keeley help Michell to avoid being arrested and try to identify the murderer . Ginny Tremaine is questioned but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell 's innocence but Finlay 's investigation lead him to recognise the motive for the crime and subsequently , he set up an elaborate trap which lead the real culprit into exposing his own guilt . `` Crossfire '' is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story . The `` message '' is conveyed in a way which wa , no doubt , appropriate for the period in which it wa made but by today 's standard seems rather heavy handed . The cinematography by J Roy Hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamp combining to evoke a look which is perfectly compatible with the drama being played out on screen . Despite it being a low budget production , `` Crossfire '' wa a great box office success and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast , two of whom were nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor ( Robert Ryan ) and Best Supporting Actress ( Gloria Grahame ) . The additional nomination for Edward Dmytryk ( Best Director ) , producer Adrian Scott ( Best Picture ) and John Paxton ( Best Writing , Adapted Screenplay ) are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie justifiably received .",1
"This movie wa recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia . Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplay ever written . It is well executed , acted and directed . The cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but I 'm sure it wa intended to be so . The screenplay is like poetry in portion of the movie , through out the movie I found myself taking pause to reflect on the comment just made on screen . This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add review . Fair warning though this wa a 6 tissue movie for me . Very touching . Very Heartfelt performance .",1
"Jeff Lieberman 's `` Just Before Dawn '' is definitely one of the most underrated horror movie ever made.The film , whilst a little bit influenced by `` Deliverance '' and `` The Texas Chain Saw Massacre '' , is extremely creepy and memorable.The suspense almost never let up and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie.The cast is excellent , Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female leads.The inbred twin are truly frightening and remorseless killers.The film is beautifully shot-it wa actually filmed on location at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon.There is very little gore , but one killing , when Verchel is stabbed in the groin , is pretty nasty and unpleasant.A must-see for slasher fans.10 out of 10-what else ?",1
"An uninspired and undistinguished `` new '' Columbo which see the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew 's wedding , only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night . Columbo investigates ... And that it is about it : indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script , given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk , who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story `` Murder Under Glass '' in the detective 's heyday ; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspect via the photo taken at the wedding , which include everybody who wa there ! Devoid of every Columbo trait possible , I thought I wa watching an episode of Hill Street Blues . An insult to the history of the series , with appropriately soap-opera style acting . Very avoidable stuff .",0
"The mystery here is why this delightful , small comedy ha been ignored by most critic and ha failed to find the audience it deserves . Simply showcasing the budding talent of Audrey Tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti . Lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterization , itÕs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and , unlike some of itsÕ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre , such a The Taste of Others , it actually entertains .",1
"Right on Colmyster . I totally concur with all your sentiment and add these . I came to my PC especially to post a comment on this dreadful ( minus ) Bgrade movie . I wa going to say that in this day and age I am at a loss to comprehend how anyone could possibly make such a woeful movie - but you beat me to it . Anyone reading this and Colmyster 's comment , trust me -- -- DON't waste you time and money . It 's an absolute shocker . The acting is totally pathetic , the script is way worse , and the ( so called ) special effect are a joke . Surely no-one actually invested money to make this movie ? I really can not think of anything else to say about this so called horror sci-fi product , but must pad this commentary to make 10 line of comment in order to have it accepted for submission .",0
"As to be expected , there 's a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always-popular premise of zombie and starring the 80 's B-movie queen Linda Blair , namely : it suck ! `` The Chilling '' is trying enormously hard  way too hard  to be a story with depth and factual background , whereas it should have just been a light-headed and gore-packed horror flick about frozen zombie . It take an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens . There 's a lot of drivel about cryogenics , which I learned in my physic class is the study of product and their behavior at extremely low temperature . So naturally , in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corps when deep frozen . Needless to say this is extremely boring , until two dim-witted night watchman decide , during an electric power failure , that it 's a good idea to put the metal-constructed cool cell outside at the height of a thunderstorm . The cooler are struck by lightening , obviously , and the body spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage . `` The Chilling '' is a boring and surprisingly ( for a late 80 's effort , at least ) gore-free horror film that doe n't even use up a quarter of it potential . All the painful attempt to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and I ca n't think of any reason why the zombie-attacks had to be so bloodless . Even in spite of the low budget available , they could have done better . The set piece , make-up effect and costume are pitiable . The research lab , for example , look like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombie could n't look le menacing with their green face and foil-wrapped outfit . How Linda Blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing low-budgeted horror flick is a complete mystery . She 's attracted to lousy B-movies like bee are to honey .",0
"From an artistic standpoint , the movie fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution . The plot is hard to follow , if there is one at all . The acting is tough to stomach . The dialogue is cliche and clearly written by somebody who doe n't know English . Only the cinematography wa worth watching in this movie , although you can still see flaw in the picture . As an Asian-American female , the movie angered me because it proved how narrow minded people can be . Politically speaking , putting Asian woman in such disgraceful role should be outlawed . Perpetuating stereotype of Asian prostitute is not only bad for the self-esteem of Asian woman , but also to the country a a whole . I feel for the lead actress who played Maya and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role . As Americans , please avoid this movie . Art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another , not hold it back .",0
"My mom took me to see this movie when it came out around Christmas of 1976 . I loved it then and I love it now . I know everyone make fun of Barbra 's hair in this one , but I think she look and sound great ! ... And I seem to remember a number of woman who copied that permed look at the time ! Also , the bath tub scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is just so sexy ! The music is great a well . This is the groovy 70 's Babs at her best !",1
"For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously , this movie will surprise you . It is not a 'whodunit ' for people who ca n't are n't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero , Professor Dexter Cornell ( Dennis Quaid ) . Cornell teach in Southern California , near the tar pit . He ha not published a novel in four year , his wife is divorcing him , he drink a bit much , and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit , which he freely dispenses to his student . He ha recommended a friend for advancement , and one bright young student ha submitted a manuscript to him a an independent project . Cornell doe n't even want to read it , so give it an `` A '' , and push it to the side . Leaning back with a drink in his office he stare out the window , when the bright young student fall past his window on the way to meeting the sidewalk in a splat encounter . Hal come to talk , and they chat , drinking some more . The Cornell realizes that he HAS to read the manuscript , now . When he go home , his wife is waiting with divorce paper . He drink some more . She leaf , and he go to a faculty affair , only to find her there . He drink even more . And when his wife learns that the student is dead , she swoon , and he learns that she had been having an affair with the student . This of course prompt him to do some more serious drinking . The next morning he wake up to find himself in the dorm room of one of his student , a freshman named Syd ( Meg Ryan ) . He feel worse than a hangover , go to the doctor and learns that he ha been poisoned , it is irreversible , and he ha 24-48 hour to live . He doe n't have much time to find out who killed him , and there are sub-plots , motif , relationship and surprise at every turn , although everything make sense at the end . All his discovery and exchange are adorned with sarcasm , dry wit and keen observation . Let 's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the adage `` publish or perish '' . There are no bad performance in this movie . There are recurrent image , and symbolism used at careful interval . Watch for the cracked glass , and image distorted through glass . Some of the camera shot are revolutionary for 1988 , and some of the violent action is carefully and skillfully choreographed . The music is unobtrusive and appropriate , although occasionally it make it 's own statement , in song lyric . The visuals in this flick are impressive . If there are any failure , it is that the opening 20 minute move a little slow , and nearly put you to sleep . But the pacing pick up quickly , with just the right amount of exposition in between action segment . There are no explicit sexual encounter , although there is violence and some bad language . This is a writer 's movie , and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure . I do think if you take it seriously , you 're already in big trouble .",1
"I love most Jet Li movie ( with the exception of Romeo Must Die ) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap three-pack with `` The Master '' and `` Twin Warriors '' . While Twin Warriors wa very impressive and I wa thoroughly intrigued by it , and the master wa a bit `` Karate Kid '' but also enjoyable , I thought this movie wa TERRIBLE . I 'm not just saying that because I 'm used to better movie . I 'm saying that it wa almost down there with `` Kazaam '' . The fight scene were terrible ( blurry camera and no real fighting ) and the plot wa your typical `` stupid kung-fu plot '' . If you are going to have a plot this stupid ( see 'man turn into woman to become all-powerful then fall in love with Jet Li ' ) you best have some great fighting to go with it . If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li movie , I suggest you go rent `` Shaolin Temple 2 '' ( aka Kids from Shaolin ) .",0
"Preminger 's adaptation of G. B. Shaw 's `` Saint Joan '' ( screenplay by Graham Greene ) received one of the worst critical reaction in it 's day . It wa vilified by the pseudo-elite , the purist and the audience wa unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant . As in `` Peeping Tom '' , the reaction wa malicious and unjustified . Preminger 's adaptation of Shaw 's intellectual exploration of the effect and action surrounding Joan of Arc ( her actual name in her own language is Jeanne d'Arc but this film is in English ) is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play , not only on the literal emotional level but formally too . His film is a Brechtian examination of the functioning of institution , the division within and without of various faction all wanting to seize power . As such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the character , including Joan herself . As played by Jean Seberg ( whose subsequent life offer a eerie parallel to her role here ) , she is presented a an innocent , a figure of purity whose very action and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone . As such Seberg play her a both Saint and Madwoman . Her own lack of experience a an actress when she made this film ( which doe show up in spot ) conveys the freshness and youth of Jeanne revealing both the fact that Jeanne la Pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence . By no mean did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film 's first release , it 's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience . Shaw and Preminger took a secular view towards Joan seeing her a a medieval era feminist , not content with being a rustic daughter who 's fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldier to and away from battlefield . Her faith , her voice , her vision which she intermingles with word such a `` imagination '' and `` common sense '' lead her to wear the armour of her fellow soldier to lead them to battle to chase the invading Englishman out of France . And yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the Dauphin ( Richard Widmark ) , the office of the clergy who try Joan led by Pierre Cauchon ( Anton Walbrook , impeccably cast ) and the action of the Earl of Warwick ( John Gielgud ) then in Joan herself . The superb ensemble cast ( all male ) portray figure of scheming , Machievellian ( although the story precedes Niccolo ) opportunist who treat religion a a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own end . The sharp sardonic dialogue give the actor great fun to let loose . John Gielgud a the eminently rational Earl whose intelligence , ( albeit accompanied by corruption ) , allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure Joan get burnt at the stake and Anton Walbrook 's Pierre Cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give Joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty . Richard Widmark a the Dauphin is a real revelation . As against-type a casting choice you 'll ever find , Widmark portrays the weak future ruler of France in a frenzied , comic caricature that 's a close a this film come to comic relief . A comic performance that feel like an imitation of Jerry Lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of France . Preminger shot `` Saint Joan '' in black and white , the cinematographer is Georges Perinal who worked with Rene Clair and who did `` The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp '' in colour . It 's perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film . Preminger 's preference for tracking shot of long uninterrupted take is key to the effectiveness of the film , there 's no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise-en-scene . It also mark the direction of Preminger 's most mature ( and most neglected period ) his focus is on the conflict between individual and the institution in which they work , how the institution function and how the individual act a per his principle . These theme get their most direct treatment in his film and a always he keep thing unpredictable and find no black and white answer . This is one of his very best and most effective film .",1
"I wa on my way out one morning when I wa checking something on the T.V . and came across this film . I do n't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it . What a fun and interesting one to watch . Well , my meeting wa pushed back , because I could n't get out of this film . It had some real interesting thing in it that marked it 's time in history , and some fun thing that they do n't have people do in today 's film because it 's not pretty . Well , there wa a lot of realism in it . The acting wa good for a 1954 film . Subtle and genuine action on the part of the character that had me watching what they were going to do next . That is why I ended up watching it . I do n't know why they do n't show it more often . I would rather watch this than some film they play more than necessary . For history buff , people who like period film , and those that are in the film appreciation group will like this one . `` The Egyptian '' ha a variety of flavor dealing with a lot of thing to look at in human nature that ha not changed since it 's time . What doe that say about u ? Those that do n't like movie that take their time to unfold and tell a good story .... are not into film . I have n't had the time to rent it if it is available , but if I get a chance to see it again , I would probably vote it a 10 .",1
"This is a great movie , all 3 were . The last one wa not a good a the first 2 but it wa made along time after and it wa pulling at straw . But you want to watch it cause it tell the end of the story . Just not how we might think it should end . These movie made me want to be there to be in all the hardship , love , tear , and laughter that the people in this movie go threw . It is one of the few movie that is good every time you see it no matter how many time that is . There are some part in the movie that the little kid wont understand and the older one maynot be old enough to watch . but it is a great movie , spanning over 20+ year .",1
"I saw this tonight with moderate expectation - if Tartan Films have picked up on something and are releasing it the that 's generally a good sign , however I 'm not normally a fan of Julie Walters , generally disliking her comedy role ( sorry to any fan , but it 's a personal thing - I just do n't find her funny in comedy ) . This wa magnificent though - a great performance by all , but Grint and Walters are exceptional ! Plenty of laugh , plenty of pathos , great timing and a wonderfully paced film - such a coming of age film would n't normally be something I 'd expect to like so much but I ca n't recommend this highly enough - and watch Rupert Grint a he matures into a fine fine actor .",1
"I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me , she 's the female Ernie Hudson A.K.A . `` Le Kiss of Death '' for * ANY * movie . Its almost * guaranteed * the movie will be bad ( e.g . Congo ) if Hudson is in it ( with the exception of the Ghostbusters film , which were intentionally campy and bad ) . Despite my instinct , and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand , yet another cinematic `` tour de force '' starring Lisa Raye , I rented it anyway . After all , I ignored my `` Hudson instinct '' on OZ and ended up watching a very quality series so I figured I 'd give this movie a chance . If you are a lover of bad movie , this is a definite must see ! This ha got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I 've seen in a loooong time . The plot is fairly straightforward : Racheal 's ( Monica Calhoun ) sister is killed by a band of brigand ( Led by Bobby Brown ! ) and , like many an action movie before this , she strap on her gun ONE LAST TIME and vow to avenge her sister death . To do this , she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses ( supposedly based on a true story of a female gang ) and they go out and exact revenge and , along the way , there 's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town . One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell , the star did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping . The funniest ( albiet unintentionally funny ) scene ? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash 's character or when Calhoun 's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her gun ( replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heaven ) or Lil ' Kim 's character joking with Lisa Raye 's character or Stacy Dash 's character being killed or Lil ' Kim 's character convincing Lisa Raye 's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey 's character talking bout `` The debt is paid '' , etc . With the exception of Calhoun 's Racheal and Bobby Brown 's Left-Eye , I ca n't even remember the name of the other character cuz I wa laughing so hard when they were introduced . If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie . Unfortunately , he try to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition , sound design ( in his defense , Hip-Hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece ) , set design , script writing nor period historical research ( wa it me , or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west ? ) seriously . Usually when I see a movie that 's not so good , I ask myself `` Could you have done any better ? '' This is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal `` YES ! ''",0
"I do n't mind sequel ; sometimes they 're better than the original . However , many time the original are best left alone .... especially when you ca n't duplicate the cast . One of the big reason `` The Magnificent Seven '' wa such a hit wa the very popular cast . This is hardly the `` magnificent seven , '' when only Yul Brynner return a one of the member of that famous group in `` The Magnificent Seven . '' With six of the seven guy absent and replaced by much lesser-known actor , this loses it appeal in a hurry . In other word , except for Brynner , these guy have no charisma ! This is a like a championship sport team fielding all substitute except one . Brynner is good , once again : fun to watch , fun to hear with that distinctive deep voice of his , but the story , not just the rest of the crew , is lame . This movie should never have been made . In the original , we cared about the `` seven ; '' in here , we could n't care le .",0
"I watched this movie with big expectation . The blurb on the back indicated that this wa going to be a nasty one . But it wa pretty tame and a little unsatisfying . The violence wa nothing I have n't seen a thousand time before , the gore level wa only average ( mind you there wa probably more than what ha been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 year - perhaps more ) , and at no stage wa I even feeling uneasy let along frightened . Again a CAT 3 movie with big wrap , ha not lived up to it hype . Sure hire this movie , but do n't go in with any expectation . I am so keen to get into the whole Asian horror scene , but am continuously disappointed . I did love Ichi , and Audition , but then again , Miike stand alone at the moment . Please inspire me ..... there is a large cluster of jaded genre fan who are starved of quality horror !",0
"This `` coming of age '' film deal with the experience of two young girl , Dani and Maureen , a they learn about life and love one fateful summer . Directed by Robert Mulligan , famous for his superb work in `` To Kill a Mockingbird , '' the film never hit a false note . All the acting is superb . As Dani , Reese Witherspoon make a stunning film debut . Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film , I felt like I wa looking through a window to reality , rather than watching a movie . I have watched this movie at least 5 time , and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movie ever made about being young , being in love , and going through the feeling , challenge , and change of young adulthood . Families with child between 10 and 15 should watch it together , and use it a a discussion piece , a it raise a number of issue about sibling rivalry , how to deal with being in love , the responsibility of a parent , etc .",1
"We see Thomas Edison , with a glowing smile on his face , trying to electrocute a 5 ton living being . Eventually he wa successful , and so the first animal snuff film is born , cleverly disguised a an amazing achievement in technology . This is scientific arrogance at it 's worst , folk . It rank up there with the doctor who decapitated a monkey just to prove that he could keep it severed head alive for 22 minute . Oh yes , there 's the absurd excuse that the elephant had been convicted of `` murder '' and sentenced to death , and that this wa a fair and humane `` execution '' . To all the people who are satisfied with this sophistry , please form a line on my right . I 'm going to give you all a big collective Three Stooges slap across the head . Go watch `` The Advocate '' ( 1993 ) , a movie based on the true story murder trial of a pig in Mideval France . 500 year later , human are still a bunch of moron I see . What 's next ?

This is a really obnoxious show . It is in fact an example of how low television ha fallen since 'reality ' got in style . Tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rude and ha awful taste . Is a house show the place for sex appeal ? Apparently some male like the show because they find Tanya attractive . The other bos is not pretty but he 's fully a rude and also ha awful taste . It is unfortunate that so many house have to be shown while someone is still living in them . Most of the people who are allegedly viewing these house before change are made should be moving into brand new house or completely empty one so they will not be insulting anyone . Most of them .. like the 'crew ' .. need to be taught manner . I can imagine how awful the British show is since the British reality show tend to be even worse when it come to manner and taste . What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel ? When it started out ( and for some year afterward ) it wa filled with treat . Now it 's one big trash machine .,0
"Valley Girl is the definitive 1980 's movie with catch phrase filtered throughout this wonderfully acted movie . The character are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual `` day-in-the-life '' of any high school , USA .

"Another great movie by Costa-Gavras . It 's a great presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics . The fact might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the US wa deeply involved in coup and support of Latin American dictatorship . Despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist/communist propaganda of the Cold War era . Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movie are always biased . For example he present the US action a brutal and inhumane , while representing Tupamaros ' extremist activity a something positive . As it turned out it wa a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of the Latin America that the US got involved . Europe is filled with poor East European prostitute . I never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girl prostituting themselves en masse a it happens in most East European country . The US wa fighting a dirty war and god bless u all the monster of Soviet Communism wa defeated . It is unfortunate the US had to do what it did in Latin America ( and elsewhere ) but sometimes you need to play dirty . This is not an idealistic world a Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe . Had Matamoros come to power in Uruguay , we would 've had another Ukraine in Latin America . All in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of time past and try to pas it a idealistic and morally correct .",0
"Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabbé who wrote the original 'The Vanishing ' ( Spoorloos ) it doe have the same overall feel , except for that Koolhoven 's style is le business-like and more lyric . The beginning is great , the middle is fine , but the sting is in the end . A surprise emotional ending . As you could read in several magazine there is some sex in the film , but it is done all very beautifully . Never explicit , but with lot of warmth and sometimes even humour . It is a shame American film ca n't be a open an honoust a this one .

"Handsome and dashing British airline pilot George Taylor ( a solid portrayal by Guiseppe Pambieri ) get beat up by thug after a wild night in Hong Kong . George meet and fall in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong ( a fine and charming performance by the lovely Chai Lee ) . George regains his health and go back to work . When Emy fails to hear from George for a lengthy amount of time , she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute . While director/co-writer Bitto Albertini doe indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft-core sex , this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze . Instead it 's a surprisingly thoughtful , touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing character ( Chai a Emy Wong is especially radiant and endearing ) . The picture start out bubbly and cheerful , but the tone radically shift into a more grim and harsh mood about two third of the way through . Emy 's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that George ha abandoned her is bleak and upsetting ; ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending . Granted , the narrative is certainly melodramatic , but never too silly or trashy . Moreover , the sex scene are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic . Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller ha a nice sizable supporting part a George 's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller . Guido Mancori 's polished cinematography offer many strikingly gorgeous shot of the exotic location . Nico Fidenco 's funky , throbbing score hit the groovy spot . Worth a look for those seeking something different .",1
"This film breech the fine line between satire and silliness . While a bridge system that ha no rule may promote marital harmony , it certainly ca n't promote winning bridge , so the satire did n't work for me . But there were some item I found enjoyable anyway , especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film . It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match . Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring , there is a referee hovering between the contestant , and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happening . At one point he even enumerates `` One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... '' a though a bid of four diamond wa a knockdown event . And people were glued to their radio for it all , a common event for championship boxing match . That spoof worked very well indeed . Unfortunately , few of the actor provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire . Paul Lukas doe n't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast ; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh were n't given good enough line ; Glenda Farrell ha a nice comic turn a a forgetful blonde at the start of the film , but she practically disappears thereafter . What a waste of talent !",0
"Mardi Gras : Made in China provides a wonderful , intricate connection between popular culture , nudity , and globalization through the making and tossing of bead . I saw this film at the International Film Festival of Boston , and wa expecting a dry introduction to globalization , but what I got wa a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both China and the United States . The eye-opening film is humorous , in-depth , serious , non-patronizing , and it leaf you wanting more a the credit role . It is worth comparing to Murderball -- it 's simply that well done . The young woman worker in China have various point of view , and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline . The reveler during Carnival are the highlight , but only because this excellent film provides in-depth context inside the factory in China without narration . Bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film ! I would have never thought about the connection between bead , China , and New Orleans ; now I think about the human connection between almost every object , but also the role of globalization , inequality , and fun . More importantly , I can make these connection without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film , unlike other film on globalization that I 've seen .",1
